Both clauses have a special reference to bearing witness in a court, but neither would seem to be confined to it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <i>do</i> evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest <i>judgment</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil</span>. Rather, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude <span class="accented">to evil</span>." A law alike for deed, for word, and for thought. The example of the many is to be shunned. "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." But "strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>). It is extraordinary that so many, even of professing Christians, are content to go with the many, notwithstanding the warnings against so doing, both of the law and of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou speak,</span> etc. Rather, "Neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to go aside after a multitude to put aside justice." The general precept is followed by a particular application of it. In judging a cause, if thou art one of the judges, thou shalt not simply go with the majority, if it he bent on injustice, but form thine own opinion and adhere to it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause</span>. After the many precepts in favour of the poor, this injunction produces a sort of shock. But it is to be understood as simply forbidding any undue favouring of the poor because they are poor, and so as equivalent to the precept in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor." In courts of justice, strict justice is to be rendered, without any leaning either towards the rich, or towards the poor. To lean either way is to pervert judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine enemy's ox</span>. A private enemy is here spoken of, not a public one, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>. It is remarkable that the law should have so far anticipated Christianity as to have laid it down that men have duties of friendliness even towards their enemies, and are bound under certain circumstances to render them a service. "Hate thine enemies" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>) was no injunction of the Mosaic taw, but a conclusion which Rabbinical teachers unwarrantably drew from it. Christianity, however, goes far beyond Mosaism in laying down the broad precept - "Love your enemies." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou see the ass of him that</span> <span class="cmt_word">hateth thee,</span> etc. The general meaning of the passage is clear - assistance is to be given to the fallen ass of an enemy - but the <span class="accented">exact</span> sense of both the second and third clauses is doubtful. Many renderings have been suggested; but it is not clear that any one of them is an improvement on the Authorised Version. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely help with him</span>. The joint participation in an act of mercy towards a fallen beast would bring the enemies into friendly contact, and soften their feelings towards each other.

The worst sin of a judge, and the commonest in the East, is to accept abribe from one of the parties to a suit, and give sentence accordingly. As such a practice defeats the whole end for which the administration of justice exists, it is, when detected, for the most part, punished capitally. Josephus tells us that it was so among the Jews (<span class="accented">Contr. Apion</span>. 2:27); but the Mosaic code, as it has come down to us, omits to fix the penalty. Whatever it was, it was practically set at nought. Eli's sons "turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). In David's time, men's hands were "full of bribes" (<a href="../../par/psalms/26-10.htm">Psalm 26:10</a>). Solomon complains of wicked men" taking gifts out of their bosoms to pervert the ways of judgment" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). Isaiah is never weary of bearing witness against the princes of his day, who" love gifts and follow after rewards" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>);who "justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>). Micah adds his testimony  - "Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob and princes of the house of Israel, that <span class="accented">abhor judgment and pervert all equity</span>. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The gift blindeth the wise</span>.

Literally, "the mind of a stranger," or, in other words, his thoughts and feelings. Thou shouldest therefore be able to sympathise with him. CEREMONIAL LAWS (vers. 10-19). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of the Sabbatical year</span>. Days of rest, at regular or irregular intervals, were well known to the ancients and some  regulations of the kind existed in most countries But entire years of rest were wholly unknown to any nation except the Israelites. and exposed them to the reproach of idleness. (See Tacit. <span class="accented">Hist</span>. 5:4: - "Septimo die otium placuisse ferunt, quia is finem laborum dedit; dein, <span class="accented">blandiente inertia</span>, septimum quoque annum ignaviae datum"). In a primitive condition of agriculture, when rotation of crops was unknown, artificial manure unemployed, and the need of letting even the best land sometimes lie fallow unrecognised, it may not have been an uneconomical arrangement to require an entire suspension of cultivation once in seven years. But great difficulty was probably experienced in enforcing the law. Just as there were persons who wished to gather manna on the seventh day (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>), so there would be many anxious to obtain in the seventh year something more from their fields than Nature would give them if left to herself. If the "seventy years" of the captivity were intended exactly to make up for omissions of the due observance of the sabbatical year, we must suppose that between the time of the exodus and the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the ordinance had been as often neglected as observed. (See <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>.) The primary object of the requirement was, as stated in ver. 11, <span class="cmt_word">that the poor of thy people may eat</span>, what the land brought forth of its own accord in the Sabbatical year being shared by them (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-6.htm">Leviticus 25:6</a>.). But no doubt it was also intended that the Sabbatical year should be one of increased religious observance, whereof the solemn reading of the law in the ears of the people at the Feast of Tabernacles "in the year of release" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>) was an indication and a part. That reading was properly preceded by a time of religious preparation (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-15</a>), and would naturally lead on to further acts of a religious character, which might occupy a considerable period (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> chs. 9. and 10.). Altogether, the year was a most solemn period, calling men to religious self-examination, to repentance, to the formation of holy habits, and tending to a general elevation among the people of the standard of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">What they leave the beasts of the field shall eat</span>. There was to be no regular ingathering. The proprietor, his servants, the poor, and the stranger were to take what they needed; and the residue was to be for the cattle and for the beasts that were in the land (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy vineyard - thy oliveyard</span>. Corn, wine, and oil were the only important products of Palestine; and this mention of the vineyard and the oliveyard shows that one and the same law was to hold good of all the lands in the country, however they might be cultivated. The whole land was to rest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a></div><div class="verse">But the seventh <i>year</i> thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.

Nothing is here added to the teaching of the Fourth Commandment; but its <span class="accented">merciful</span> character is especially brought out. Men are called on to observe it, <span class="accented">in order that</span> their cattle may obtain rest, and their servants, together with the stranger that is within their gates, may find refreshment. It is to be borne in mind that the foreign population of Palestine was mostly held to hard service. (See <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a>.) Verse 13 contains two injunctions - one general, one special: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> "Be circumspect" (or cautious, careful) "in respect of <span class="accented">all</span> that I command you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> "Do not so much as utter the name of any false god." Not even to mention their names, was to show them the greatest contempt possible; and, if followed out universally, would soon have produced an absolute oblivion of them. Moses, it may be observed, scarcely ever does mention their names. Later historians and prophets had to do so, either to deliver the true history of the Israelites, or to denounce idolatries to which they were given. There are many words one would wish never to utter; but while wicked men do the things of which they are the names, preachers are obliged to use the words in their sermons and other warnings.

"The sanctification of days and times," says Richard Hooker, "is a token of that thankfulness and a part of that public honour which we owe to God for admirable benefits, whereof it doth not suffice that we keep a secret calendar, taking thereby our private occasions as we list ourselves to think how much God hath done for all men; but the days which are chosen out to serve as public memorials of such his mercies ought to be clothed with those outward robes of holiness whereby their difference from other days may be made sensible" (<span class="accented">Eccles. Pol</span>. 5:70, &sect; 1). All ancient religions had solemn festival seasons, when particular mercies of God were specially commemorated, and when men, meeting together in large numbers, mutually cheered and excited each other to a warmer devotion and a more hearty pouring forth of thanks than human weakness made possible at other times. In Egypt such festivals were frequent, and held a high place in the religion (Herod. 2:58-64:). Abraham's family had probably had observances of the kind in their Mesopotamian home. God's providence saw good now to give supernatural sanction to the natural piety which had been accustomed  thus to express itself. Three great feasts were appointed, of which the most remarkable features were - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That they were at once agricultural and historical - connected with the regularly recurrent course of the seasons, and connected also with great events in the life of the nation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That they could be kept only at one spot, that namely where the tabernacle was at the time located; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That they were to be attended by the whole male population. The three festivals are here called - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The Feast of Unleavened Bread</span> (ver. 15), the early spring festival, at the beginning of barley harvest in the month Abib (Nisan), commemorative of the going forth from Egypt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">The Feast of Harvest</span> (elsewhere called "of weeks") at the beginning of summer, when the wheat crop had been reaped, commemorative of the giving of the law; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="accented">The Feast of Ingathering</span> (ver 16) in Tisri, at the close of the vintage, when all the crops of every kind had been gathered in, commemorative of the sojourn in the wilderness. The first of the three, the feast of unleavened bread, had been already instituted (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3-10</a>); the two others are now for the first time sketched out, their details being kept back to be fined in subsequently (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-21</a>, and 34-36). Here the legislator is content to lay it down that the great feasts will be three, and that all the males are to attend them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feast of unleavened bread</span>. This commenced with the Passover, and continued for the seven days following, with a "holy convocation" on the first of the seven and on the last (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-8</a>). Unleavened bread was eaten in commemoration of the hasty exodus from Egypt (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>). A sheaf of new barley - the first-fruits of the harvest - was offered as a wave-offering before the Lord (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-14</a>). Every male Israelite of full age was bound to attend, and to bring with him a free-will offering. <span class="cmt_word">In the time appointed of the month</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the fourteenth day (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">None shall appear before me empty</span>. This rule applies, not to the Passover only, but to all the feasts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, <i>which is</i> in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feast of harvest</span>. Fifty days were to be numbered from the day of offering the barley sheaf, and on the <span class="accented">fiftieth</span> the feast of harvest, thence called "Pentecost," was to be celebrated. Different Jewish sects make different calculations; but the majority celebrate Pentecost on the sixth of Sivan (May 25). The main ceremony was the offering to God of two leavened loaves of the finest flour made out of the wheat just gathered in, and called the first-fruits of the harvest. The festival lasted only a single day; but it was one of a peculiarly social and joyful character (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9-11</a>). Jewish tradition connects the feast further with the giving of the law, which must certainly have taken place about the time (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The firstfruits</span>. Rather, "Of the first-fruits." The word is in apposition with "harvest," not with "feast." <span class="cmt_word">Which thou hast sown</span>. The sown harvest was gathered in by Pentecost; what remained to collect afterwards was the produce of plantations. <span class="cmt_word">The feast of ingathering</span>. Called elsewhere, and more commonly, "the feast of tabernacles" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>), from the circumstance that the people were commanded to make themselves booths, and dwell in them during the time of the feast. The festival began on the 15th of Tisri, or in the early part of our October, when the olives had been gathered in and the vintage was completed. It lasted seven, or (according to some) eight days, and comprised two holy convocations. In one point of view it was a festival of thanksgiving for the final getting in of the crops; in another, a commemoration of the safe passage through the desert from Egypt to Palestine. The feast seems to have been neglected during the captivity, but was celebrated with much glee in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the end of the year</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the end of the agricultural year - when the harvest was over  - as explained in the following clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a></div><div class="verse">Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God</span>. This seems to moderns a very burthensome enactment. But we must remember that Palestine is not bigger than Wales, and that great gatherings had great attractions for many in the ancient world, when they were the only means by which information was spread, and almost the only occasions on which friends and relations who lived far apart could expect to see each other. The European Greeks had, in their Olympian and other games, similar great gatherings, which occurred once or twice in each year, and, though under no obligation to do so, attended them in enormous numbers. It may be doubted if the religious Hebrews <span class="accented">felt</span> the obligation of attendance to be a burthen. It was assuredly a matter of great importance, as tending to unity, and to the quickening of the national life, that they should be drawn so continually to one centre, and be so frequently united in one common worship. Most students of antiquity regard the Greek games as having exerted a strong unifying influence over the scattered members of the Grecian family. The Hebrew festivals, occurring so much more frequently, and required to be attended by <span class="accented">all</span>, must have  had a similar, but much greater, effect of the same kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-18.htm">Exodus 23:18</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of the Paschal sacrifice</span>. That the Paschal lamb is here intended by "my sacrifice," seems to be certain, since the two injunctions to put away leavened bread, and to allow none of the victim's flesh to remain till the morning (see <a href="../../par/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>), are combined in the Paschal sacrifice only. Of all the offerings commanded in the law the Paschal lamb was the most important, since it typified Christ. It may therefore well be termed, in an especial way, "God's sacrifice." <span class="cmt_word">By the fat of my feast</span> some understand the fat of the lamb, others the best part of the feast (Keil) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the lamb itself.

The outline of law put before the Israelites in the "Book of the Covenant" terminated with this remarkable prohibition.

Various explanations have been given of it; but none is saris-factory, except that which views it as "a protest against cruelty, and outraging the order of nature," more especially that peculiarly sacred portion of nature's order, the tender relation between parent and child, mother and suckling. No doubt the practice existed. Kids were thought to be most palatable when boiled in milk; and the mother's milk was frequently the readiest to obtain. But in this way the mother was made a sort of accomplice in the death of her child, which men were induced to kill on account of the flavour that her milk gave it. Reason has nothing to say against such a mode of preparing food, but feeling revolts from it; and the general sense of civilised mankind reechoes the precept, which is capable of a wide application - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not seethe a kind in his mother's milk.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 23:20-31 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-31.</span> - THE REWARDS OF OBEDIENCE. God always places before men" the recompense of the reward." He does not require of them that they should serve him for nought. The "Book of the Covenant" appropriately ends with a number of promises, which God undertakes to perform, if Israel keeps the terms of the covenant. The promises are: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he will send an angel before them to be their guide, director, and helper (vers. 20 - 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he will be the enemy of their enemies (ver. 22), striking terror into them miraculously (ver. 27), and subjecting them to other scourges also (ver. 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he will drive out their enemies "by little and little" (ver. 30), not ceasing until he has destroyed them (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That he will give them the entire country between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean on the one hand, the Desert and the Euphrates on the other (ver. 31). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That he will bless their sustenance, avert sickness from them, cause them to multiply, and prolong their days upon earth (vers. 25, 26). At the same time, all these promises - except the first - are made conditional. If they will "beware" of the angel and "obey his voice," then he will drive their enemies out (vers. 22, 23): if they will serve Jehovah, and destroy the idols of the nations, then he will multiply them, and give them health and long life (vers. 24-26), and "set their bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river" (ver. 31). So far as they fall short of their duties, is he entitled to fall short of his promises. A reciprocity is established. Unless they keep their engagements, he is not bound to keep his. Though the negative side is not entered upon, this is sufficiently clear. None of the promises, except  the promise to send the angel, is absolute. Their realisation depends on a strict and hearty obedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I send a messenger before thee.</span> Jewish commentators regard the messenger as Moses, who, no doubt, was a specially commissioned ambassador for God, and who might, therefore, well be termed God's messenger. But the expressions - "He will not pardon your transgressions," and "My name is in him," are too high for Moses. An angel must be intended - probably "the Angel of the Covenant," - whom the best expositors identify with the Second Person of the Trinity, the Ever-Blessed Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">To keep thee in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the way</span> is not simply "to guide thee through the wilderness, and prevent thee from geographical error," but to keep thee altogether in the right path. s, to guard thy going out and thy coming m, to prevent thee from falling into any kind of wrong conduct. <span class="cmt_word">The place which I have</span> <span class="cmt_word">prepared</span> is not merely Palestine, but that place of which Palestine is the type - viz., Heaven.

David had a "Hittite" among his "mighty men" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>), and was on friendly terms with Araunah the "Jebusite" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-24</a>).

It is always to be borne in mind that with the idolatries of the heathen were connected "works of darkness," which it is shameful even to speak cf. The rites of Baal and Ashtoreth, of Chemosh, Molech, Rimmon, and the other Canaanite and Syrian deities were at once defiled by the abomination of human sacrifices, and polluted with the still more debasing evil of religious impurity. "The sacrifice offered to Ash-toreth," says Dr. Dollinger, "consisted in the prostitution of women: the women submitted themselves to the visitors of the feast, in the temple of the goddess or the adjoining precinct. A legend told of Astarte (Ashtoreth) having prostituted herself in Tyre for ten years: and in many places matrons, as well as maidens, consecrated themselves for a length of time, or on the festivals of the goddess, with a view of propitiating her, or earning her favour as <span class="accented">hieroduli</span> of unchastity... In this way they went so far at last as to contemplate the abominations of unnatural lust as a homage rendered to the deity, and to exalt it into a regular cultus. The worship of the goddess at Aphaca in Lebanon was specially notorious in this respect. The temple in a solitary situation was, as Eusebius tells us, a place of evil-doing for such as chose to ruin their bodies in scandalous ways... Criminal intercourse with women, impurity, shameful and degrading deeds, were practised in the temple, where there was no custom and no law, and no honourable or decent human being could be found." (<span class="accented">Jew and Gentile</span>, vol. 1. pp. 428, 429; Darnell's translation.) <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">utterly overthrow them.</span> The heathen gods are identified with their images. These were to be torn from their bases, overthrown, and rolled in the dust for greater contempt and ignominy. They were then to be broken up and burnt, till the gold and the silver with which they were overlaid was calcined and could be stamped to powder. Nothing was to be spared that had been degraded by idolatry, either for its beauty or its elaborate workmanship, or its value. All was hateful to God, and was to be destroyed.

If the Israelites were exact in their obedience, and destroyed the idols, and served God only, then he promised to bless "their bread and their water" - the food, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whether meat or drink, on which they subsisted, and to give them vigorous health, free from <span class="cmt_word">sickness</span> of any kind, which he pledged himself to <span class="cmt_word">take away from the midst</span> of them. Though Christians have no such special pledge, there is, no doubt, that virtuous and godly living would greatly conduce to health, and take away half the sicknesses from which men suffer, even at the present day.

"Moab was sore aft-aid of the people, because they were many" (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a>). Later it is spoken of by Rahab as general (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9, 11</a>). A very signal indication of the alarm felt is given in the history of the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee</span>.

"Hornets" here, and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-20.htm">Deuteronomy 7:20</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>, are probably plagues or troubles of any kind, divinely sent to break the power of the heathen nations, and render them an easier prey to the Israelites, when they made their invasion. Possibly, the main "hornets" were the Egyptians, who, under Rameses III., successfully invaded Palestine about the time of Israel's sojourn in the wilderness, and weakened the power of the Hittites (Khita). The <span class="cmt_word">Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite</span>. By a common figure of speech, a part is put {or the whole - three nations for seven.

It is related that when the kingdom of Samaria was depopulated by the removal of the Ten Tribes, there was a great increase of lions, which preyed upon the scanty remnant left (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>). Even in France, after the Franco-German war, it was found that in many districts wolves increased. A third reason why the nations were not subdued all at once, not mentioned here, is touched in <a href="../../par/judges/2-21.htm">Judges 2:21-23</a> - "The Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily, that through them he might prove Israel, whether they would keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, or not."

This passage by itself would be sufficient to confute Dr. Brugsch's notion, that the Yam Suph (or "Red Sea" of our translators) is the Lake Serbonis, which is a part of the Mediterranean or "Sea of the Philistines," and cannot stand in contrast with it. The "Sea of the Philistines" and the "Red Sea" mark the boundaries of the Holy Land East and West, as the "Desert" and the "River" (Euphrates) do its boundaries North and South. That Moses here lays down those wide limits which were only reached 400 years later, in the time of David and Solomon, and were then speedily lost, can surprise no one who believes in the prophetic gift, and regards Moses as one of the greatest of the Prophets. The tract marked out by these limits had been already promised to Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Its possession by Solomon is distinctly recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>. As Solomon was "a man of peace," we must ascribe the acquisition of this wide empire to David. (Compare <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The river</span> (<span class="accented">han</span>-<span class="accented">nahar</span>) is in the Pentateuch always the Euphrates.

They retired northwards, and gave strength to the great Hittite kingdom which was for many centuries a formidable antagomst of the Egyptian and Assyrian empties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 23:32-33

The "Book of the Covenant" ends as it began, with a solemn warning against idolatry. (See <a href="../../par/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a>.) "Thou shalt make no covenant with them <span class="accented">nor with their gods</span>." Thou shalt not even suffer them to dwell side by side with thee in the land, on peaceable terms, with their own laws and religion, lest thou be ensnared thereby, and led to worship their idols and join in their unhallowed rites (ver. 33). The after history of the people of Israel shows the need of the warning. From the exodus to the captivity, every idolatry with which they came into close contact proved a sore temptation to them. As the author of Kings observes of the Ten Tribes" - The children of Israel did secretly those things which were not right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places in all their cities... And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree; and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger; for they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, "Ye shall not do this thing" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make no covenant with them</span>. See below, <a href="../../par/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>. According to the forms usual at the time, a treaty of peace would have contained an acknowledgment of the gods of either nation, and words in honour of them. (See the "Treaty of Rameses II. with the Hittites," given in the <span class="accented">Records of the Past</span>, vol. 4. pp. 27-32.) This would have been equivalent to "making a covenant with their gods." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a></div><div class="verse">They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not dwell in the land</span>. This law did not, of course, affect proselytes; nor was it considered to preclude the continuance in the land of the enslaved Gibeonites. It forbade any Canaanite communities being suffered to remain within the limits of Palestine on friendly terms with the Hebrews.
