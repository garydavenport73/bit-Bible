We have, however, in ver. 28, and still more plainly in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, and Deuteronomy 5:22, the desired statement. The fiction of a double decalogue, invented by Goethe and supported by Hitzig, and even Ewald, is absolutely without foundation in fact.

It has been questioned whether God did actually write the words upon the second tables; but Kurtz's arguments upon the point are unanswerable.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> - THE FULFILMENT BY GOD OF HIS PROMISE TO MOSES. This section coheres closely with the last section of the preceding chapter, and must be regarded, as the historical account of how God fulfilled the promises there made by him to Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19-23</a>). The promises were mainly two - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he would proclaim his name to him afresh; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pass by him, and let him see, after he had passed, what man might see of his glory. The fulfilment of the first promise appears in the long enumeration of attributes contained in vers. 6, 7; the fulfilment of the second is expressed with extreme brevity in the words - ,' And the Lord passed by before him" (ver. 6). Probably no further description could be given of that marvellous manifestation beyond those words in which it was promised (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21-23</a>). Its effects were seen in that permanent reflection of God's glory on the face of Moses, which thenceforth compelled him to wear a veil mostly when he showed himself to the people (vers. 33-35). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord descended in the cloud</span>. The cloudy pillar, which had stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-10.htm">Exodus 33:10</a>), was withdrawn while Moses ascended Sinai, and probably disappeared from men's sight. When Moses reached the top, it <span class="cmt_word">descended</span> once more from the sky, <span class="cmt_word">and stood with him</span> <span class="cmt_word">there.</span> Then a voice from the cloud <span class="cmt_word">proclaimed the</span>   <span class="cmt_word">name of the Lord</span> in the manner more fully stated in the ensuing verses.

God did as he had promised in <a href="../../par/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22, 23</a>. He made his glory pass by, Moses, as he stood in a "clift of the rock," and "covered him with his hand as he passed by," and, when he had passed, "took away his hand," and allowed Moses to look after him, and see a glorious and transcendent vision - a vision so bright and radiant, and <span class="accented">so real</span>, that the light which streamed from it settled on Moses face, and remained there (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And proclaimed</span>. In his passage God proclaimed his name; not however, as in the burning bush, an actual name contained in a single word - but a description in many words of his essential nature  - a description setting forth especially his three qualities of mercy, truth, and justice, but dwelling most upon the first of the three  - perhaps, as most essential, for" God is love" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>) - certainly, as moot needing to be prominently set forth at the time, when his favour had been justly forfeited, and but for ]]is mercy could not have been restored.

Some critics take this clause in an entirely different sense, translating "who in destroying will not wholly destroy" (Maimonides, Pool, De Dieu, Patrick), or, "who acquits even him who is not innocent" (Geddes); but the rendering of our translators (which agrees with the LXX.], is approved by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Kalisch, Keil, and others. It seems to have been also the meaning assigned to the passage by the prophet Nahum, who quotes it (<a href="../../par/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>) when he is threatening Nineveh. Visiting the iniquity. See above, <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. While setting forth his attribute of mercy in all its fulness, God will not have his attribute of justice forgotten (ver, 8).

Dazed, as it would seem, by the splendour of the vision which he had beheld, Moses forgot that God had already pledged himself to renew the covenant, and lead the people in person to Canaan. In his forgetfulness, he once more set himself to intercede with God on their behalf, and besought him - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That  he would go up with them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pardon them; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he would once more take them as his inheritance (ver. 9). Without replying separately to these requests, God formally renews the covenant; promises not only to go up with the people, but to work miracles for them (ver. 10), and to drive out the nations before them when they have arrived (ver. 11); and makes a brief summary of the chief points of positive observance, which he requires of them in addition to the moral law. These points may be reduced to twelve: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That no treaty of peace should be made with the Canaanite nations (ver. 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That all their images, altars, and groves should be destroyed (ver. 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That no molten image should be made to represent God (ver. 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That the Passover festival should be observed as previously commanded (ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That the first-born should be dedicated, or redeemed (vers. 19, 20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> That the Sabbath rest should be observed at all times of the year (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> That the feast of Pentecost (weeks) should be observed regularly (ver. 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> That the feast of tabernacles should also be observed (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> That at all the three great festivals all the males should appear before God (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> That no leaven should be used with any sacrifice (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> That first-fruits of all things should be offered to God (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> That no kid should be seethed in her mother's milk (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If now I have found grace in thy sight</span>. The vision vouchsafed him makes Moses feel that he has indeed been received into favour with God. The first use which it occurs to him to make of his position is to intercede anew for his people, he, apparently, forgets that God has already promised to go with them (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-17.htm">Exodus 33:17</a>), and prefers exactly the same request which he had made on the preceding day, and which had been granted. To this he adds a prayer for <span class="cmt_word">pardon</span>, and a request that God would take Israel <span class="cmt_word">for his inheritance</span>. The last phrase is a new one, but expresses perhaps no more than has been implied in such phrases as "thy people, which thou hast purchased" (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>) - "ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).

The word translated "grove" (<span class="accented">asherah</span>) is a modification of the name Ashtoreth.

To appreciate the other temptation, we require to know the peculiar circumstances of the East. It is necessary there to complete the ploughing before the spring rains are over. These last but a short time; and when they are once past no rain can be looked for till the autumn.

The original promise to Abraham was to give to his seed "the land of Canaan" (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5-7</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-27.htm">Exodus 34:27</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-35.</span> - FINAL DESCENT OF MOSES FROM SINAI. The covenant having been renewed, Moses prepared to descend, having first however received a command to commit to writing the words of this second covenant (ver. 27). He received back the tables from God, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, and after a stay in Sinai of equal duration with the former one (ver. 28), descended, having the tables in his hands. He was not aware that the skin of his face had become radiant (ver. 29), and first learnt the fact by the rulers being afraid to come near him (ver. 30). After conversing with them and with the people he resolved to "put a vail on his face" ordinarily, only taking it of[ when he "went in before the Lord" into the ,, tent of meeting," and when, having received a message from the Lord to the people, he came out to deliver it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write thou these words</span>. Literally, "write <span class="accented">thee</span> these words" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "write them for thyself and for thy people." <span class="cmt_word">According to the tenor of these words have I made a covenant</span>. That is, "the covenant on my part is conditional on the observance of <span class="cmt_word">these words</span> on the part of Israel." The "words" intended are those of vers. 10-26. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a></div><div class="verse">And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights</span>. As on the former occasion (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). The patience and faith of the people was tested by this second long delay. Happily, they stood the test; and on Moses' final descent from Sinai the Israelites were found expectant and obedient (vers. 30-32). <span class="cmt_word">He did neither eat bread nor drink water</span>. This was so also on the former occasion (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. The near presence of God sustained the vital powers and made food unnecessary. Moses, Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and our Lord have alone accomplished a fast of this duration. Modern parodies are not held by scientific men to belong to the category of established facts. <span class="cmt_word">He wrote upon the tables</span>. It has been argued from this expression that Moses wrote the words on the second tables; and it would be natural so to understand the passage, had nothing else been said on the subject. But in ver. 1 we are told that "God said, I will write upon these tables;" and the same is repeated in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>. Moreover in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, it is distinctly declared "He" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) "wrote on the tables according to the first writing." We must therefore regard "he" in this passage as meaning "the Lord," which is quite possible according to the Hebrew idiom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The skin of his face shone while he talked with him</span>. Rather, "through his talking with him." The glory of God, as revealed to Moses on this occasion, caused his face to become henceforth radiant. Compare the effect of the transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The Vulgate wrongly translates <span class="accented">haran</span>, "to shine," as if it were derived from <span class="accented">keren</span>, "a horn" - whence the painters of mediaeval times commonly represent Moses as horned. St. Paul's words (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>) are conclusive as to the true meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a></div><div class="verse">And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were afraid</span>. They shrank from Moses, as if he were more than man. (Compare <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>.) Perhaps they thought that what they saw was his spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-31.htm">Exodus 34:31</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses called unto them</span>. Moses bade them approach - no doubt assured them that there was no cause for fear (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/24-38.htm">Luke 24:38, 39</a>) - and by his manner and familiar voice dispelled their fears and re-assured them. <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and all the rulers...  returned unto him</span>. Apparently, in their alarm they had drawn back. Being re-assured, they "returned." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-32.htm">Exodus 34:32</a></div><div class="verse">And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">that the Lord had spoken.</span> "All," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "that the Lord had commanded him to enjoin upon them" - especially the precepts in vers. 10-26 - not all that he had heard from God in the space of forty days and forty nights. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>till</i> Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Till</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses had done speaking with them</span>. The Hebrew text will not bear this rendering. All the ancient versions (LXX. Vulg. Syr. etc.) and the Targums agree that the meaning is - "when Moses had done speaking, he put a veil on his face." And this agrees with the plain meaning of vers. 34 and 35, which are to be taken connectedly. Moses first delivered his message with face unveiled, then he veiled himself, and thenceforth he wore a veil at all times except when he sought the Divine presence in the "tent of meeting" or the tabernacle, and when he delivered to the people any message sent them from God by him. He wore the veil ordinarily to prevent them from being dazzled. He took it off when he entered the tabernacle, that the Divine presence might shine fully on him and renew his strength. He kept it off when he returned, if he had any message to the people, until he had delivered it, in order the more fully to authenticate the message and shew to the people that it was from God. Then the <span class="cmt_word">children of Israel saw</span> <span class="cmt_word">the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone</span> (ver. 35). Having discharged himself of the message intrusted to him, he once more covered himself, and continued veiled until he again entered the tabernacle. The only objection that can be taken to this exegesis is derived from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-16</a>, which has been thought to imply that Moses wore the veil whenever he was in the sight of the people.  But the passage does not really assert any such thing. It is quite enough for the argument, that under the old covenant a veil had been worn to conceal some of its glory. This concealment St. Paul contrasts with the openness of Christianity (vers. 13, 18); while at the same time he argues that it may be viewed as typical of that blindness and darkness which was characteristic of the Jewish nation of his day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
