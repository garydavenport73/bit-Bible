He is called in the inscriptions <span class="accented">Daryavush</span>, which name means "Holder," or "Supporter." Herodotus (6:98) explains it as "Coercer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). Hitherto the prophets have dated the time of the exercise of their office from the reigns of the legitimate Hebrew monarchs; it shows a new slate of things when they place at the head of their oracles the name of a foreign and a heathen patenlate. The Jews had, indeed, now no king of their own, "the tabernacle of David had fallen" (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), and they were living on sufferance under an alien power. They had returned from exile by permission of Cyrus in the first year of his occupancy of the throne of Babylon sixteen years before this time, and had commenced to build the temple soon after; but the opposition of neighbours, contradictory orders from the Persian court, and their own lukewarmness had contributed to hinder the work, and it soon wholly ceased, and remained suspended to the moment when Haggai, as the seventy years of desolation drew to an end, was commissioned to arouse them from their apathy, and to urge them to use the opportunity which was afforded by the accession of the new monarch and the withdrawal of the vexatious interdict that had checked their operations in the previous reign (see Introduction, &sect; 1; and comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>). The sixth month, according to the sacred Hebrew calendar, which reckoned from Nisan to Nisan. This would be Elul, answering to parts of our August and September. <span class="cmt_word">In the first day.</span> This was the regular festival of the new moon (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>), and a fitting time to urge the building of the temple, without which it could not be duly celebrated. <span class="cmt_word">By</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by the hand</span> (as in ver. 3), the instrument whom God used (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-35.htm">Exodus 9:35</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-35.htm">Acts 7:35</a>) <span class="cmt_word">Haggai the prophet</span> (see the Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>, "Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel." The temporal head of the nation, the representative of the royal house of David, and therefore with the high priest jointly responsible, for the present state of affairs, and having power and authority to amend it. The name, as explained, and rightly, by St. Jerome, means, "Born in Babylon," and intimates the truth concerning his origin. He is called Sheshbazzar in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>, which is either his name at the Persian court, or is an erroneous transliteration for a synonymous word (see Kuabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The name is found in the cuneiform inscription, as <span class="accented">Zir-Babilu.</span> Shealtiel (or Salathiel) means, "Asked of God." There is a difficulty about Zerubbabel's parentage. Here and frequently in this book, and in Ezra and Nehemiah, as well as in <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, he is called "son of Shealtiel;" in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> he is said to be the son of Pedaiah the brother of Salathiel. The truth probably is that he was by birth the son of Pedaiah, but by adoption or the law of the <span class="accented">levirate</span>, the son of Salathiel. He was regarded as the grandson of Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah. <span class="cmt_word">Governor</span> (<span class="accented">pechah</span>). A foreign word, used in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>, in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>) and  frequently in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, to denote an inferior satrap or subordinate governor. Strassmaier (<span class="accented">ap.</span> Knabenbauer) notes that in Assyrian the word is found in the form <span class="accented">pachu</span>, that <span class="accented">pichatu</span> means "a province," <span class="accented">pachat</span>, "a district." It seems natural, though probably erroneous, to connect it with the Turkish pashah. But see the discussion on the word in Pusey, 'Daniel the Prophet,' p. 566, etc. Instead of "Governor of Judah," the LXX. here and ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2</a> reads, "of the tribe of Judah." One of the house of David has the government, but the foreign title applied to him shows that he holds authority only as the deputy of an alien power. Judah was henceforward applied to the whole country. The prophecy in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> still held good. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua</span>. The highest spiritual officer (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>). This Joshua, Jehoshua, Jeshua, as he is variously called, was a son of Josedech who, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, had been carried captive to Babylon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>), and grandson of that Seraiah who, with other princes of Judah, was slain at Riblah by the Babyloniaes (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, etc.). The parentage of Zerubbabel and Joshua is specially mentioned to show that the former was of the house of David and the latter of the family of Aaron, and that even in its depressed condition Israel retained its rightful constitution (see note on Zechariah 3:1).

Trochon justly remarks that this expression is not found in the earlier books of the Bible - the Pentateuch, Joshua, and Judges. If these books were contemporary with the prophets, the phrase would certainly occur in them (see a valuable note in the Appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's Commentary on Haggai, in 'The Canibridge Bible for Schools'). <span class="cmt_word">This people;</span> <span class="accented">populus iste</span> (Vulgate), with some contempt, as if they were no longer worthy to be called the Lord's people (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-14.htm">Haggai 2:14</a>).

The excuse for their inaction may have had various grounds. They may have said, reckoning from the final destruction of Jerusalem ( <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>), that the seventy years' captivity was not complete; that there was still danger from the neighbouring population; that the Persians were adverse to the undertaking; that the unfruitful season rendered them unable to engage in such a great work; and that the very fact of these difficulties existing showed that God did not favour the design.

The temple mount is certainly not meant, as if they were to bring wood from it. Nor can Lebanon be intended, as in <a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>; for the injunction looks to an immediate actual result, and in their depressed circumstances they were scarcely likely to interest the Sidonians and Tyrians to provide cedar for them. There was abundance of wood close at hand, and the "kings forest" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>) was in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem. There is no mention of stone, probably because the foundations had long been laid, and the ruins of the old temple supplied material for the new one; and, indeed, stone was to be had in abundance everywhere; or it may be that the prophet names merely one opening for their renewed activity, as a specimen of the work required from them.

In the Latin Vulgate, in Tischendorf's Septuagint, and in many editions of the Hebrew Bible, the whole of this verse is wrongly annexed to the following chapter.

The joyous nature of this festival was sadly marred on this occasion. Their crops were scanty, and they had. no temple in whose courts they might assemble to pay their vows and offer their thank offerings. The building which had begun to make some progress only the mere showed its poverty. Everything tended to make them contrast the present with the past. But God mercifully relieves their despondency with a new message. <span class="cmt_word">By the prophet Haggai</span> (see note on Haggai 1:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak now to Zerubbabel.</span> The message is addressed to the heads of the nation, temporal and spiritual, and to all the people who had returned (see notes on Haggai 1:1 and 12).

Many have thought that Haggai himself was of the number. It was sixty-eight years ago that the temple was destroyed, and we can well believe that its remarkable features were deeply impressed on the minds of those who as boys or youths had loved and admired it. Ezra tells us (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>) that "many of the priests and Levites" [when the foundation first was laid] and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house,...  wept with a loud voice." This house. The prophet identifies the present with Solomon's temple, as being adapted for the same purposes, to fill the same place in the national life, built on the same hallowed spot, and partly with the same materials. In the Jews' eyes there was one only temple, whatever might be the date of its erection or the comparative worth of its decorations and materials. <span class="cmt_word">First</span>; <span class="accented">former</span>, as ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">How do ye see it now?</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-18.htm">Numbers 13:18</a>). In what condition do ye see this house now? <span class="cmt_word">Is it not in your eyes in com<span class="accented">parison</span> of it as nothing?</span> The words, "in comparison of it," ought to be omitted, as not required by the Hebrew idiom. Does it not seem in your eyes as if it had no existence? If the injunction of Cyrus (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>, etc.) had been carried out, the dimensions cf. the new temple would have exceeded those of the old; but Zerubbabel seems to have been unable, with the small resources at his disposal, to execute the original design, though even so the proportions were not greatly inferior to those of the earlier temple. But the chief inferiority lay in the absence of the splendour and enrichment with which Solomon adorned his edifice. The gold which he had lavished on the house was no longer available; the precious stones could not be had. Besides. these defects, the Talmudists reckon five things wanting in this second temple, viz. the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim and mercy seat; the holy fire; the Shechinah; the spirit of prophecy; the Urim and Thnmmim. It was, according to Josephus, only half the height of Solomon's-sixty cubits ('Ant.,' 15:11, 1), and it appears to have been in many respects inferior to the first building ('Ant.,' 4:02). Hecabaeus of Abdera gives the dimensions of the courts as five hundred feet in length and a hundred cubits in breadth (double the width of the court of the tabernacle), and the size of the altar as twenty cubits square and ten cubits high (see Josephus, 'Cont. Ap.,' 1:22; Conder, 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 370). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I <i>am</i> with you, saith the LORD of hosts:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be strong.</span> This is repeated three times for emphasis' sake. The same exhortation was given by David to Solomon before the building of the first temple (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-10.htm">1 Chronicles 28:10</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6, 7, 9</a>). Haggai seems to suggest comfort in the thought that such admonition was needed at that time as well as now when they are so depressed (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And work;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and do</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">facite</span>, The word is used absolutely, as often (camp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>, and note there).

But there is intended no injunction respecting the observation of the old covenant, but a consolatory message under present despondency. Others take it with the verb that fallows: "the word and my Spirit remain among you." but it is best to leave the clause in the abrupt fashion in which it is introduced: "(Here is, here stands) the word that I covenanted with you." If anything is supplied, we might insert, "I will confirm." The promise of present help is confirmed by the remembrance of God's former covenant with Israel, that they should be his peculiar people and possess the right of access to him and a claim on his help (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>). This clause is entirely omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">So my Spirit remaineth among you;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and my Spirit abode among you.</span> But the clause refers to God's presence among them now,  which was shown by the revelations made to the prophets, as Haggai and Zechariah, and which exhibits itself in his providential ordering of events, the removal of obstacles, the furthering of the good work. Wordsworth notes that "Christ was with the ancient Church in the wilderness (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-9.htm">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); and now, when the eternal <span class="accented">Word</span> became incarnate, and when the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span> was sent to be <span class="accented">in the midst</span> of God's faithful people, then this prophecy was fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">Fear ye not.</span> If God be for us, who can be against us?"

The expression is equivalent to "once again within a little time." <span class="cmt_word">I will shake,</span> etc. Some difference of opinion exists as to the events here adumbrated. All, however, agree in seeing an allusion to the promulgation of the Law on Mount Sinai, which was accompanied with certain great physical commotions (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7, 8</a>), when, too, the Egyptians were "shaken" by the plagues sent on them, and the neighbouring nations, Philistia, Edom, Moab, were struck with terror (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14, 16</a>). This was a great moral disturbance in the heathen world; the next and final "shaking" will be under the Messianic dispensation for which the destruction of heathen kingdoms prepares the way. The Israelites would soon see the beginnings of this visitation, e.g. in the fall of Babylon, and might thence conclude that all would be accomplished in due time. The prophet calls this interval "a little while" (which it is in God's eyes and in view of the vast future), in order to console the people and teach them patience and confidence. The final consummation and the steps that lead to it in the prophet's vision are blended together, just as our Lord combines his prediction about the destruction of Jerusalem with details which concern the end of the world. The physical convulsions in heaven and earth, etc., spoken of, are symbolical representations of political revolutions, as explained in the next verse, "I will shake all nations," and again in vers. 21, 22. Other prophets announce that Messiah's reign shall be ushered in by the overthrow or conversion of heathen nations; e.g.. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, etc.; Isaiah 19:21, 22; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>, where our Lord refers to the end of this world). But before Christ's first advent there was a general shaking of empires. Persia fell; Alexander's dominion was divided and gradually shattered before the might of Rome; Rome herself was torn with civil wars. The faith in the power of national gods was everywhere weakened, and men were prepared to receive the new revelation of one Supreme Deity, who came on earth to teach and save. Now is mentioned the object or consequence of this shaking of nations. <span class="cmt_word">The desire of all nations shall come.</span> This is the rendering of the ancient Jewish expositors, the Chaldee Targum, and the Vulgate, which gives, <span class="accented">Veniet desideratus cunctis gentibus.</span> Tile words in this case point to a person, and this person can be no one else than the Messiaih for whom "all nations consciously or unconsciously yearn, in whom alone all the longings of the human heart find satisfaction" (Perowne). But there is difficulty in accepting this view. The word rendered "the desire" (<span class="accented">chemdath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> singular, the verb "shall come" (<span class="accented">bau</span>) is plural, as if it was said in Latin, <span class="accented">Venient desiderium omnium gentium.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "The choice things [or, 'portions'] of all the nations shall come." The plural verb seems fatal to the idea of a person being spoken of; nor is this objection answered by Dr. Pusey's allegation that the object of desire contains in itself many objects of desire, or Bishop Wordsworth's refinement, that Messiah is regarded as a collective Being, containing in his own Person the natures of God and man, and combining the three offices of Prophet, Priest, and King. Every one must see that both these explanations are forced and unnatural, and are conformed rather to theological considerations than to grammatical accuracy. <span class="accented">Chemdah</span> is used for "the object of desire," as <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>, where it refers to Hezekiah's treasures, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, "the goodly vessels" of the temple (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-9.htm">Nahum 2:9</a>). Nowhere is any intimation given that it is a name applied to the Messiah; nowhere is any such explanation offered of the term so applied. The word is a common one; its meaning is well ascertained; and it could hardly have been understood in any but its usual acceptation without some preparation or further definition. This acceptation is confirmed by the mention of "the gold and silver" in ver. 8. The Revised Version cuts the knot by rendering, "the desirable things;" Perowne affirms that the plural verb denotes the manifoldness and variety  of the gifts. This seems scarcely satisfactory. May it not be, as Knabenbauer suggests, that "the desire of all nations" forms one notion, in which the words, "all nations," have a predominating influence, and so the plural ensues by <span class="accented">constructio ad sensum?</span> The meaning, then, is that all nations with their wealth come, that the Gentiles shall devote their treasures, their powers, whatever they most highly prize, to the service of God. This is what is predicted elsewhere (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5-7, 11, 13</a>, 17), and it is called, metaphorically, coming with treasures to the temple. To hear of such a glorious future might well be a topic of consolation to the depressed Israelites. (For a further development of the same idea, see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24, 26</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">I will fill this house with glory.</span> There is a verbal allusion to the glory which filled Solomon's temple at the dedication (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>), but the especial mode in which it is to be manifested in this case is not here mentioned. The previous clause would make the reference rather to the material offerings of the Gentiles, but a further and a deeper signification is connected with the advent of Messiah (as <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>), with which the complete fulfilment commenced.

Revised Version, following the Septuagint, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former." "This house" means the temple at Jerusalem, regard not being paid to the special building (ver. 3), whether of Solomon, or Zerubbabel, or Herod. As understood by the hearers, this promise referred to the material fiches, the precious things offered by the Gentiles. To us it speaks of the promise of Christ, God incarnate, in the holy city and in the temple itself, and of his presence in the Church, wherein he abides forever. Here is the complete answer to the complaint of ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">In this place will I give peace.</span> Primarily this means in Jerusalem, the place where the temple stood, God would grant peace from enemies, freedom from danger, and quiet enjoyment of promised blessings (comp. Isaiah 55:18; <a href="../../par/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4, 5</a>). But the promise is not fulfilled by this; the peace promised to the spiritual temple is that peace of heart and conscience which is given by him who is the Prince of Peace (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and which includes all the graces of the Christian covenant (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>). The first temple was built by the king whose name is "Peaceful;" the second is glorified by the presence of the "Peace bringer" (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). At the end of this verse the LXX. has an addition not found in the Hebrew, "even peace of soul for a possesion to every one who buildeth, to raise up this shrine."

"The true Zerubbabel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the Son and Antitype of Zerubbabel, is the signet in the hand of the Father, both passively and actively, whereby God impresses his own majesty, thought, and words, and his own image, on men, angels, and all creatures" (Corn. a Lapide <span class="accented">ap.</span> Pusey). <span class="cmt_word">I have chosen thee.</span> This is not a personal assurance only to Zerubbabel, for neither he nor his natural seed reigned in Jerusalem, or rose to any special eminence in the kingdoms of this world.

Promises are often made in Scripture to individuals which are accomplished only in their descendants; witness those made to Abraham and the other patriarchs, the prophecies of Jacob to his sons, and many others of a similar nature in the Old Testament, Those large promises made to David in old time, that his seed should endure forever, that hie throne should be as the sun before God (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), were now passed on to Zerubbabel and to his line, because of him was to spring Messiah, in whom alone these wide predictions find their fulfilment, "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end" (<a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../haggai/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Haggai 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Haggai 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
