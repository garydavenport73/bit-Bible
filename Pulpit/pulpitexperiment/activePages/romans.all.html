This last seems best to suit the line of thought in this place. The Jews evinced <span class="accented">ignorance, i.e.</span> of the real meaning and purpose of Law, in resting on it for justification. This is St. Paul's constant position in speaking of the office of Law - that it could not and was never meant to justify, but rather to convince of sin; to establish the need of, and excite a craving for, redemption; and so prepare men to appreciate and accept the righteousness of God in Christ which was its <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see especially ch. 7; and cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).<span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being here anarthrous, we translate it according to the rule observed in this Commentary. The apostle has, indeed, in view the Mosaic Law; but it is the principle of law, as such, that he is speaking cf. He next proceeds, as elsewhere throughout the Epistle, to quote from the Old Testament in illustration of the contrast between the two principles of justification, and this with the intention of showing that even in the Pentateuch that of justification by faith was intimated, and thus that it was all along the real <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Law. "Nam si prophetas suae sententiae testes citasset, haerebat tamen hic scrupulus, cum Lex aliam justitiae formam praescriberet. Hunc ergo optime discutit, quum ex ipsa Legis doctrina stabitit fidei justitiam" (Calvin). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the Law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by</span> (literally, in) them (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>). This quotation is intended to express, in the words of Moses himself, the principle of Law, viz. the requirement of entire observance of it, such as the apostle elsewhere contends is impossible (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10-12</a>). It may be objected that Moses himself, in the original passage, does not seem to be setting forth any such impossible requirement. He says, in the name of the Lord, "Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which, if a man do, he shall live in them;" implying, it would seem, that a man might so keep them as to live in them; else were the injunction delusive. In the quotation also of the same text in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>, only such a requirement as might have been fulfilled appears to be understood. But St. Paul (as appears from the context, and from <a href="../../par/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>, where the text is similarly cited) refers to it as expressing the strict principle of law, as above defined. It, then, the text, in its original connection, seems to fall short of the sense put upon it, we may understand the apostle to quote it as a well-known one, sufficiently suggestive, if taken, as he intends it to be, in connection with others, such as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, cited with it in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them." It is his way to refer to familiar texts, or such as most readily occur to him, as suggestive of Old Testament ideas which he expects his readers to be acquainted with. Calvin's remarks on this whole passage deserve attention: "Lex bifariam accipitur. Nunc enim significat universam doctrinam a Mose proditam, nunc pattern illam quae ministerii ejus propria erat; quae scilicet praeceptis, praemis, et poenis continetur Quod ergo hic de justitia Legis dicitur referre convenit non ad totam Mosis functionem, sed ad partem istam quae peculiariter quodammodo ei commissa fuit." His drift is, that the passage before us intimates the strict principle of law, which it was the peculiar function of Moses to promulgate, whereas the passage which follows from Deuteronomy is significant of its <span class="accented">universa doctrina.</span> This distinction may help us to understand St. Paul's drift, in referring, as he proceeds to do, to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>. The determination of this drift is attended with some difficulty. First, we observe that, whereas the original passage certainly refers to the Law given to the Israelites through Moses - to the same "statutes and judgments" that were the subject of the previous quotation - St. Paul applies it to describe justification through faith in Christ; and, secondly, that, in order to apply it, he alters some parts of it, and interposes comments of his own. One view is that he is only making a free-use of the words of the passage to clothe his own thoughts. So Bengel: "Ad hunc locum quasi parodia suavissime alludit, sine expressa allegatione." But his obvious intention, here as elsewhere, to support his positions from the old Scriptures surely precludes this view. Nor can he be supposed to cite the passage as simply prophetical of the gospel which was to supersede the Law, since it evidently was not so. The proper view seems to be that he adduces it as illustrating, in the first place. what Calvin calls the <span class="accented">universa doetrina</span> of the Law itself, with regard to its actual application as a <span class="accented">norma vivendi to</span> the needs of man. Here, he would say, the very Mosaic dispensation is presented to us, not as exacting any impossible obedience to the strict behests of law, but only such as the "circumcised in heart" could render, and be accepted still; it is presented to us, not as a rigid external code, enjoining and threatening, but as a word very nigh unto us, even in our heart, that we may do it; it is, in fact, an anticipation and foreshadowing of gospel salvation. In confirmation of this view of the apostle's meaning, it is to be observed that the passage occurs, not in the earlier books of Moses, but in Deuteronomy, which appears as an appendix to them, containing for the most part long discourses in the style of the prophets, wherein the Law is, as it were, spiritualized, and its <span class="accented">universa doctrina</span> opened out. In it we feel ourselves as rising out of the region of strict legal exaction into a higher and more spiritual one. Observe also that the passage before us is based on the idea of a people circumcised in heart, and loving the Lord with all the heart and all the soul (vers. 6, 20); on an ideal view of a state of favour and acceptance never realized in Jewish history, but such as we find often in the prophetic writings (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, the famous passage referred to more than once in the New Testament as having its eventual fulfilment in Christ). Thus the passage before us is legitimately referred to by St. Paul, as an intimation in the Pentateuch itself of the "righteousness which is of faith."

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</span>. The apostle's purpose in varying from the original is obvious from his interposed comments, and from the application that follows. It seems to be as though he had said, "See how, with a slight alteration, the passage in Deuteronomy becomes an exact description of our Christian doctrine." The most marked alteration is the substitution of "into the deep" for "beyond the sea." The "sea" in the original, to which the term "abyss" is applicable (cf. <a href="../../par/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>), may have suggested the word; but St. Paul here evidently means by it the regions of the dead, imagined as subterranean, equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. For use of the word in this sense, cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> (which may have been present to his mind), <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> cf. also <a href="../../par/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>; in which passages <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote the penal abode, corresponding to the Greek idea of Tartarus; but the word itself does not contain this idea, which is by no means intimated here. It may be taken to denote <span class="accented">Hades</span>, into which Christ "descended." Some commentators suppose the previous expression, "ascend into heaven to bring Christ down," to mean bringing him back to earth from heaven, whither he has ascended now. But the mere fact of its coming first, as well as the general sense of the passage, shows it to refer rather to the Incarnation, and what follows to the Resurrection. These were the two grand stages in the great work of redemption; both were required that "the righteousness which is of faith" might effectually be brought "nigh unto us." The impossible task of effecting either was not required of man; God has done both for us, and we have but to "believe in our hearts," that "the word" of his grace may be nigh us, in our mouth and in our heart, that we may do it. Thus all that was intimated or foreshadowed by that old passage in Deuteronomy is in its fullest sense to us fulfilled. (It may be observed, in passing, that the application to the Incarnation of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., is, if correct, one of the instances of St. Paul's recognition of the Divine pre-existence of our Lord.) In ver. 9 the applicability of the words, "in thy mouth, and in thine heart," to the gospel dispensation is shown; the two expressions, properly understood, denoting all that is required of us. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth must be taken to express generally, not only fearless avowal of the Christian faith, but also consistent life, according to the full meaning of our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>, etc. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth, too, would have a peculiar significance then, when Christians were often so sorely tempted to deny him under persecution (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>). We may observe also how "the mouth" is elsewhere regarded as the index of the heart; as the main bodily organ whereby character is evinced and expressed (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, etc.). Further, the belief spoken of is <span class="accented">belief in the heart -</span> a living operative faith, not intellectual conviction only. Nor is belief that God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead to be taken as meaning belief of this one article of the Creed alone; it carries with it belief in the gospel generally, the doctrine of the Resurrection being here, as elsewhere, regarded as the central doctrine on which all the rest depends (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). "Haec summa Evangelii est. Nam, cum credimus Christum excitatum esse e mortuis, credimus sum pro peccatis satisfecisse, et in coelis regnare, ut nos ad imaginem suam perficiat" (Bucer). In ver. 10, where the offices of the heart and of the mouth are denoted in general terms, the distinction between "unto righteousness" with respect to the one, and "unto salvation" with respect to the other, is significant. By faith alone we are justified; but by confession in actual life, which is the fruit of faith, our salvation is secured.

It is (he would say) in itself applicable to Jew and Gentile alike, and it must needs be so, since the one God is the same to all that call upon him, even as the Prophet Joel also testified. The thought thus expressed was one deeply fixed in St. Paul's mind. He elsewhere speaks Of the very unity of God as implying of necessity that he is the same alike to Jews and Gentiles (see above, on Romans 3:29).

The text from Joel is in a passage which is distinctly Messianic; the same that is quoted by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16</a>) as fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</span> This question may be taken, in the first place, as serving to connect the two passages from Joel and from Isaiah (see previous note). But it is further the beginning of a sorites, suggested by a new thought, which is carried out to the end of the chapter. The course of this new thought through the rest of the chapter may be expounded as follows: It might be pleaded, in behalf of the unbelieving Jews, that they had never really heard, through preachers duly sent to them, the gospel message; and hence that they were not to be blamed for rejecting it. With this idea before him, the apostle first (vers. 14, 15) allows generally, in the form of a series of questions, that, as before <span class="accented">calling on the Lord</span> there must be <span class="accented">faith</span>, so before <span class="accented">faith</span> there must be <span class="accented">hearing</span>, before <span class="accented">hearing</span> there must <span class="accented">be preaching</span>, and for <span class="accented">preaching</span> there must be authorizing <span class="accented">mission</span>; and he quotes, in illustration, a passage from Isaiah, which describes beautifully the preaching of good tidings of peace by commissioned messengers to all the world. But he is careful to add (vers. 16, 17) that, according to the same prophet, such universal <span class="accented">preaching</span>, and consequent <span class="accented">hearing</span>, does not involve universal <span class="accented">hearkening</span>; thus showing, in view of the main purpose of his argument, that the fact of the Jews not <span class="accented">hearkening</span> now is no evidence that they had not <span class="accented">heard.</span> Then he goes on to ask whether any could plead the excuse of not having <span class="accented">heard</span>, so as to justify want of the <span class="accented">faith</span> that cometh of <span class="accented">hearing.</span> Nay, he replies (ver. 18), the sound of the good tidings has gone forth to all the earth, even like the language of nature spoken of in <a href="../../par/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. Then (ver. 19), pressing his argument home to the Jews, who have been all along in view, he asks, "But I say, Did not <span class="accented">Israel</span> know?" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, being different from <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> previously used, must express some different meaning. But what St. Paul exactly meant by it is not quite clear. The quotations from the Old Testament that follow in proof of knowledge (vers. 19, 20) seem to support the view that what Israel knew, or ought to have known, was the Divine design of the promulgation of the "good tidings" to all the world, which has just been spoken cf. Such promulgation should have been to them no stumbling-block; for it had been told to them from Moses downwards, and they had full opportunity of <span class="accented">knowing</span> it. Lastly (ver. 21), the apostle intimates that the present state of things, in which Gentiles accept the gospel while Israel in the main rejects it, far from being an objection to it, is but a further fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecies, which represent God as making himself known to those who had not known him, while pleading with Israel in vain. This exposition of the supposed course of thought being borne in mind, the passage (with the further aid of some interposed comments) may become intelligible. It continues: And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard! and how shall they hear without a preacher! and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that [preach the gospel (or, good <span class="accented">tidings</span>) of peace, and] bring glad tidings of flood things! (<a href="../../par/isaiah/3-7.htm">Isaiah 3:7</a>). The genuineness of the. words within brackets is at least doubtful. Even with them the text is not quoted in full, though sufficiently to remind of its purport.

The unexpressed nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> appears from the context to be men in general, not the Jews in particular.

The "sound" and the "words" in the psalm are those of the heavens and the firmament. But in the second part of the psalm, beginning at ver. 7, the psalmist passes from God's revelation of himself in nature to his revelation of himself in his Word. Still the psalm itself cannot well be understood as intimating the universal proclamation of the gospel. Nor is it necessary to suppose that St. Paul so understood it. Enough for him that the words he quotes express admirably what he desires to say.

It may be observed that in the Greek we have the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,, in both classes of the sentence, though, in order to bring out the supposed meaning in the first clause, it is there, in the Authorized Version, rendered "people," and in the second, "nation." The passage occurs in the song attributed to Moses in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, and expresses the idea of God, in consequence of the defaults of Israel, favouring those who were so far, as it were, no nation at all, so as to provoke Israel to jealousy. It is therefore aptly cited as an intimation in the Pentateuch itself of the calling of the Gentiles in place of unbelieving Israel. The idea involved in "provoke you to jealousy" - in the sense of moving to emulation, so that Israel itself as a nation might, through the calling of the Gentiles, in the end be saved - is pursued, as will be seen, in the chapter that follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a></div><div class="verse">But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Esaias is very hold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>).

He answers - No; impossible! God's ancient covenant with his people stands; the remnant of believers even now is a sign of his continued favour to his ancient people, as was, in the time of Elijah, the remnant that had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor does the fact of its being a remnant only imply now, any more than then, that the nation as such is cast off; and further, the calling of the Gentiles, far from being intended to exclude God's ancient people, will be the means eventually of bringing it wholly in. Such is the apostle's prophetic vision of the future, in view of which he bursts at the end of the chapter into glowing admiration of the inscrutable ways of God. In the course of it also (vers. 17-25) he introduces a warning to Gentile believers not to pride themselves against the Jews because of present preference to them, or to regard their own position of privilege as indefeasible. It must still be borne in mind that it is the position before God of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> that is all along in view. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Hath God east away his people!

Only here in the New Testament; but cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>; also <a href="../../par/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>) <span class="cmt_word">unto him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Even so at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace</span>. The usual interpretation of this whole passage, and notably that of the ancients, has been to take the proof of God not having cast off his people as beginning in ver. 1, with "for I also," etc., and all the rest to be in sequence. Chrysostom's explanation of the argument is to the following effect: God has not rejected his ancient people; for I myself am eminently of it; and I have been selected as a chief proclaimer and expounder of the gospel to the world; this would not have been the case if the nation had been cast off. But it may be said to me," You are only one of the ancient people; you are not the people." Nay, but I do not stand alone; there are thousands of Israelite believers as well as myself; and these are God's true people, the people whom he foreknew. And of them there may be more than we are aware of; it is as it was in the days of Elias; he had supposed himself to be left alone; but he was told that there were seven thousand with him who were God's true people still. And so now, there is a faithful remnant, the number of which is known to God alone, which is his people still, according to the election of grace. The same Father further understands the citation of the whole of the passage from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>, though not required for the apostle's proof, to be intended as significant. It would have sufficed, he says, to cite only what was said about a remnant being left; but the whole complaint of Elias is cited, so as to show by the way that the present rejection of Christ and persecution of the Church by the majority of the Jews had also its counterpart in ancient times; and thus the apostle, he says, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the unbelieving Jews) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It is to be observed that the above interpretation of the passage, which in its main points has been most generally adopted, goes on two suppositions; vie. that "for I also<span class="accented"></span>," in ver. 1, is the first part of the proof that Israel is not cast off; and that "which he foreknew," in ver. 2, is intended as a limitation of the meaning of "his people." According to another view, decidedly upheld by Meyer, "for I also" is not part of the proof, but connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: "I must needs say, God forbid! being myself a Hebrew of the Hebrews" Then, according to this view, comes the positive statement that God has not east off his people in the same general sense as before, after which the proof begins; the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> not being a limitation of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but intended to enforce the idea of the impossibility of the final rejection of the race of Israel (cf. ver. 29; also <a href="../../par/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>). The fact that, throughout the chapter, it is Israel as a nation that is in view, and that the coming of the whole nation into the kingdom of Christ is contemplated in the end, adds decided probability to this view of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, etc., in ver. 1, may still be regarded as possibly part of the proof. St. Paul's designation of himself as "of the seed of Abraham" seems meant to express that he was an Israelite of pure descent, not a proselyte or descended from proselytes. In <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>, as well as here, he specifies his tribe as that of Benjamin, the tribe that with Judah had clung to the house of David, and had shared the privileges of Judah. The quotation from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>. is given freely from the LXX., varying a little, but not so as to affect the meaning. One variation is in the feminine, instead of masculine, article before <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>, which has been explained by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> understood (so in the Authorized Version, "the <span class="accented">image</span> <span class="accented">of</span> Baal "), or by there having been a female Baal, or by the god having been supposed androgynous, or by the feminine being used of idols in contempt. St. Paul may possibly have found this reading in his copy of the LXX. The variation is of no importance with regard to the drift of the passage. "According to the election of grace," at the end of ver. 5, does not seem to be directly suggested by the passage cited, but added by St. Paul so as to make plain his position - maintained throughout the Epistle, and about to be pressed in this chapter on the consideration of Gentile Christians - that the calling of all, whether Jews or Gentiles, is "of grace," and not claimable as of right by any on the ground of the merit of their own works. And in order to enforce this position, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the word "grace" loses its essential meaning. <span class="cmt_word">[But if of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.]</span> The preponderance of ancient authorities is against the retention of the clause within brackets, which does not seem required. It is the same as in <a href="../../par/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a>.

If so, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> must mean the defect from such full complement - not. indeed (as some have explained), the small number (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of believers) now opposed to the full number in the future, but abstractedly, <span class="accented">defect</span>, or <span class="accented">fewness</span>, as opposed to <span class="accented">fulness.</span> This interpretation agrees with the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament, viz. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, where it seems to signify "defect," though used in that passage with a moral reference. The reason why the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Jews is the riches of the Gentiles is that the refusal of the Jews to accept the gospel had been the occasion of its being offered to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>; also <a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9</a>). It is not, of course, meant that the gospel was not originally intended for all the world, but only that the present and immediate promulgation of it to the Gentiles had been due to the Jews' refusal. Otherwise, we may conceive, it would have been after the fulness of the Jews had come in that it would have been extended through them to the Gentiles (el. <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>). Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>, where, as in other prophetic passages, the vision presented is that of the scattered <span class="accented">sons</span> of Israel being first brought into the glorified holy city, and the Gentiles gathering round them through the ever-open gates.

In thus addressing the Gentile in the second person singular, the apostle brings his warning home to any individual Gentile Christian who might be inclined to boast; though regarding him still as representing Gentile believers generally. They are compared to slips of the wild olive tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleaster</span>), which was unproductive (cf.

Whether or not such a reversal of the usual system of grafting would have the imagined effect does not matter, as long as the illustration serves St. Paul's purpose well, and helps us to grasp, his conception. The common process is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... to marry<br />A gentle scion to the wildest stock,<br />And make conceive a bark of baser kind,<br />By bud of nobler race."</span> In the illustration before us a scion of wildest stock is supposed to be made to conceive through the stock of nobler race to which it is united. The selecting the olive tree for illustration is happy, inasmuch as it was not only a characteristic produce of Palestine, but also regarded as symbolical of a plant of grace; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, "I am a green olive tree in the house of God;" also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>. See also the parable of Jotham (<a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>), where the trees apply first to the olive tree to be their king; and observe also there the word "fatness," used here also by St. Paul: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; (LXX.). The "branches" against which the ingrafted scion is warned not to boast are not exclusively either the broken-off or the remaining ones, but, as the sequel shows, the natural branches of the tree generally. The Gentile Christian is not to contemn the race of Israel because so large a portion of it is at present apart from the Church and under judgment; for it is, after all, from the stock of Israel, into which he has been engrafted, that he derives all his own fertility. As to the Christian Church being ever regarded as derived from that of Israel, the fulfilment and outcome of the ancient covenant, see note on Romans 1:2; and cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "For salvation is of the Jews."

Thou art on thy trial, as they were, and alike liable to be broken off for the like cause; their present rejection should inspire in thee, not boast-fullness, but fear. The question has been raised whether St. Paul (using, as he does, the terms <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) has now the election and final salvation of individuals in view, or still only the calling to a state of salvation of races or communities of men - of the Jewish race on the one hand, and Gentile Churches on the other. The whole purport of this section of the Epistle (ch. 9, 10, 11.) seems to demand the latter view. (As to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, see on ver. 17.) Besides, if by the broken-off branches were meant simply individual unbelievers, how could we explain their being "grafted in again" (vers. 23, 24), seeing that the contemplated restoration is regarded in vers. 25, 26 as something that is to take place in the possibly distant future, after "the fulness of the Gentiles" has come in? Thus this passage is really irrelevant to any doctrines about individual election and salvation that may have been built upon it. It is, however, important as confirming the general view of Divine election not being irrespective of the conditions of human faith and perseverance.

But "with God all things are possible" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-27.htm">Mark 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a>). Nay - so the thought goes on - it would seem in itself more likely, and according to the nature of things, that the Jews should be brought into the Church, which is really their own, and the true fulfilment of their own oracles, than that Gentiles, who had had no similar preparation, should have been so.

St. Paul announces it as a "mystery," which his readers may be ignorant of, but which he wishes them to know. By the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as used by St. Paul, is meant something hidden from man in the Divine counsels till made known by revelation (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; and, in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> - a passage which expresses clearly the apostle's meaning in his use of the word). In the LXX. it denotes any Divine secret, which may or may not be made known to man (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18, 19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>; Wisd. 2:22; Ecclus. 22:22 Ecclus. 27:16). So also in the Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>) it is said to be given to the disciples to know the <span class="accented">mysteries</span> of the kingdom of heaven, but to others in parables. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> were Divine secrets (as in the Eleusinian Mysteries) which were revealed to the initiated alone. St. Paul uses the word with the same essential meaning; only he speaks of <span class="accented">mysteries</span> which had already been revealed to himself and others by the Spirit, and has ever in view the Divine purposes, previously unknown, for the salvation of mankind. Thus in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; and Ephesians 3:3, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, he speaks of the Divine purpose to "gather in one all things in Christ," and that "the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs," etc., as a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, "not made known in other ages unto the sons of men," but now revealed to the "holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." (The other passages in which St. Paul uses the word are <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>.) Here he announces the Divine purpose to save "all Israel" at last through the calling of the Gentiles as a <span class="accented">mystery</span> which has been revealed to himself and others, and which he desires the Gentile Christians to be aware of, lest they should be "wise in their own conceits," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presume on their present position of privilege through ignorance of what is in store for Israel.

So, it may be said, must the verb he understood where St. Paul elsewhere uses it with a similar reference in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;</span> being there the nominative to the verb. But <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being the nominative here, the more obvious meaning seems to be that the shutting up was God's doing. Some, understanding it so, would soften the expression by explaining that God allowed them to become so shut up. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Diodorus), But we need not shrink from the plain meaning of the expression, viz. that it was God's own act. He is not thus represented as plunging men into inevitable infidelity, having given them no choice. As in the case of the <span class="accented">hardening</span> spoken of' above, his dealings are <span class="accented">judicial</span>; the state into which. they are now by him shut up has not been undeserved. And, further, his ultimate purpose is here distinctly declared to be one of mercy. The way in which the apostle regards such present judicial dealing as conducive to final mercy appears to be such as this. It is the doctrine of the whole Epistle that salvation is to be attained by man's renouncing his own imagined righteousness, and submitting himself to the righteousness of God. It conduces to this end that his <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> should have its course and consequences; so that, conscience being at length awakened, he may long for deliverance from his hopeless state, and appreciate the offered salvation (see ch. 7.). So the Gentile world was long shut up in its self-induced, but also judicial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>); that, "the wrath of God" being at length revealed to it from heaven, the "righteousness of God" might also be revealed to it and laid hold cf. In like manner God deals now with the Jews, who still persist in going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting themselves to the righteousness of God. He shuts them up for the present in their <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, to the end that at length, after their long judgment, and stirred up by the fulness of the Gentiles coming in, they may feel their need, and accept salvation. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the concluding clause seems to mean generally all mankind, Jews as well as Gentiles; and <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> (as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was understood above with respect to "all Israel," as suggested by the context and the general drift of the chapter) God's embracing all races of mankind at last in the arms of his mercy by calling them into the Church. Thus the latter expression is not in itself adducible in support of the doctrine of universalism. Certainly the prospect of a universal triumph of the gospel before the end rises here before the apostle in prophetic vision; and it may be that it carries with it to his mind further glories of eternal salvation for all, casting their rays backward over all past ages, so as to inspire an unbounded hope. Such a hope, which seems elsewhere intimated (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 20-23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, would justify the glowing rhapsody of admiration and thanksgiving that follows more fully than if we supposed the apostle to contemplate still the eternal perdition of the multitudes who in all the ages have not on earth found mercy.

HORTATORY. (See summary of contents, p. 17.) It is St. Paul's way to supplement his doctrinal treatises with detailed practical directions as to the conduct that should of necessity ensue on belief in the doctrines propounded. So also in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, etc., where, as here, he connects his exhortations with what has gone before by the initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. Beyond his exposition of the truth for its own sake, he has always a further practical aim. Saving faith is ever with him a living faith, to be shown by its fruits. Nor, according to him, will these fruits follow, unless the believer himself does his part in cultivating them: else were these earnest and particular exhortations needless. If, on the one hand, he is the great assertor of our salvation being through faith and all of grace, he is no less distinct for the necessity of works following, and of the power of man's free-will to use or resist grace; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, where, speaking of himself, he does not mean to say that grace had made him what he was in spite of himself, but that grace had not been in vain, because he himself had worked with grace. All was of grace, but he himself had laboured, assisted by grace working with him. It will be observed how comprehensive is the survey of Christian duty that here follows, reaching to all the relations of life, as well as to internal disposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>. - E. <span class="accented">Various practical duties enforced.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech you therefore, brethren</span> (he does not command, as did Moses in the Law; he beseeches; he is but a fellow-servant, with his brethren, of Christ; he does not "lord it over God's heritage" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>), but trusts that they will of their own accord respond to "the mercies of God" in Christ, which he has set before them), <span class="cmt_word">by the mercies of God</span> ("Qui misericordia Dei recte movetur in omnem Dei <span class="accented">voluntatem</span> ingreditur.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the usual one for the <span class="accented">presenting</span> of sacrificial animals at the altar (Xen., 'Anab.,' 6:1.22; Lucian, 'De Sacrif.,' 13. The LXX in <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7, 10</a>, has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. Cf. <a href="../../par/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>: <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 28</a>, and <span class="accented">supra, 6:</span>13). <span class="accented">Our bodies</span> are here specified, with probable reference to the bodies of victims which were offered in the old ritual. But our offering differs from them in being "a <span class="accented">living</span> sacrifice," replete with life and energy to do God's will (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6, 7, 8</a>, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5, 6, 7</a>), yea, and oven inspired with a new life - a life from the dead (<a href="../../par/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>). Further, the thought is suggested of the abuse of the body to uncleanness prevalent in heathen society (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>). The bodies of Christians are "members of Christ," "temples of the Holy Ghost," consecrated to God, and to be devoted to his service (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>, etc.); and not in heart only, but in actual life, of which the body is the agent, we are to offer ourselves, after the example of Christ. <span class="accented">Your reasonable service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must be taken in apposition to "present your bodies, rather than to "sacrifice," it being the act of offering, and not the thing offered. that constitutes the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This word is especially used for the ceremonial worship of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1, 6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>), the counterpart of which in Christians is, according to St. Paul, not ceremonial service, but rather that of a devoted life (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; Hebrews 41:28). The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously understood. It probably means <span class="accented">rational</span>, denoting a moral and spiritual serving of God, in implied opposition to mechanical acts of outward worship. "Respectu intellectus et voluntatis" (Bengel). It may be taken to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). Though the offering of the body is being spoken of, yet "bodily self-sacrifice is an <span class="accented">ethical</span> act" (Meyer). Cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>. The word itself occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>, where its meaning, though obscure, may be similar.

The phrase, "this world" or "age"(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, may be understood with reference to the rabbinical division of time into <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the latter denoting the age of the Messiah. The New Testament writers seem to regard themselves as still in the former, though to them it is irradiated by beams from the latter, which had already dawned in Christ, though not to be fully realized till the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (see note on Hebrews 1:2). The transformation here spoken of consists in the <span class="accented">renewal of the mind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), which denotes the Understanding, or thinking power, regarded as to its moral activity. And Christian <span class="accented">renewal</span> imparts not only the will and power to do God's will, but also intelligence to discern it. Hence follows <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; and also <span class="accented">supra</span> ch. 1:28, where the Gentiles were said to have been given up, in judgment, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, when <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> may <span class="accented">possibly</span> mean <span class="accented">undiscerning.</span> See note on that passage). It is to be observed, lastly, that the present tenses of the verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, unlike the previous aorist <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, intimate progressive habits. The perfect Christian character is not formed all at once on conversion (of <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; see also previous note on Romans 6:13, with reference to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). So far the exhortation has been general. The apostle now passes to particular directions; and first (vers. 3-9) as to <span class="accented">the use of gifts.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I say, through the grace given unto me</span> (the grace of apostleship to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>). He is about to warn against either neglecting or exceeding the special graces given to each person; and he may, perhaps, mean to imply here that he himself, in giving these admonitions, is exercising, without exceeding, his own special grace) <span class="cmt_word">to every man that is among you</span> (this is emphatic. The pretensions to superiority of some at Corinth who possessed more showy gifts than others had shown how the admonition might need to be pressed on all; and in a community like that of the Romans there might well be a special tendency to assumption on the part of some), <span class="cmt_word">not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly</span> (rather, as in the Revised Version <span class="accented">so to think as to think soberly</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">to be minded so as to be sober-minded</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</span>.

It seems to be because by faith we become <span class="accented">receptive</span> of the grace given to each of us. Hence the faith assigned by God to each is regarded as "the regulative standard; the subjective condition" (Meyer)of the several gifts or graces. Cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a> and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, where miraculous powers are spoken of as dependent on the amount of faith. Tholuck explains thus: "Faith in an unseen Christ brings man into connection with a world unseen, in which he moves without distinctly apprehending it; and in proportion as he learns to look with faith to that world, the more is the measure of his spiritual powers elevated."

The illustration of the body with its members to set forth the mutual dependence on each other of the several members of the Church with their several gifts and functions, and the importance of all for the well-being of the whole, is further carried out in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span> In <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a> and Ephesians 4:15, 16, Christ is regarded, somewhat differently, as the exalted Head over the Church which is his body.

The elliptical form of the original has been retained in the above translation, without the words interposed for elucidation in the Authorized Version.

Thus the general meaning would be - we are all one body, etc., but having our several gifts, to be used in accordance with the purpose for which they are severally given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As in the Authorized Version, which is decidedly preferable, hortation being evidently intended from the beginning of ver. 6. The drift is that the various members of the body having various gifts, each is to be content to exercise his own gift in the line of usefulness it fits him for, and to do so well. The references are not to distinct orders of ministry, in the Church, but rather to gifts and consequent capacities of all Christians. The gift of <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, which is mentioned first, being of especial value and importance (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>, seq.), was the gift of inspired utterance, not of necessity in the way of prediction, but also, and especially, for "edification, and exhortation, and comfort" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>), for "convincing," and for "making manifest the secrets of the heart" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24, 25</a>). He that has this special gift is to use it "according to the proportion of his faith;" for the meaning of which expression see on <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> above (ver. 3). According to the prophet's power of faith to be <span class="accented">receptive</span> of this special gift, and to <span class="accented">apprehend</span> it if granted to him, would be the intensity and truth of its manifestation. It would seem that prophets might be in danger of mistaking their own ideas for a true Divine revelation (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>); and also that they might speak hastily and with a view to self-display (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-33</a>), and that there was a further gift of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> required for distinguishing between true and imagined inspiration (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>). Further, the spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-32.htm">1 Corinthians 14:32</a>); they were not carried away, as the heathen <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was supposed to be, by an irresistible Divine impulse; they retained their reason and consciousness, and were responsible for rightly estimating and faithfully rendering any revelation (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>:30) granted to them. Delusion, inconsiderate utterance, extravagance, as well as repression of any real inspiration may be meant to be forbidden in the phrase. (The view of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> being meant objectively of the general Christian doctrine, from which the prophecy was not to deviate - whence the common use of the expression, <span class="accented">analogia fidei -</span> is precluded by the whole drift of the passage. It is not found in the Greek Fathers, having been apparently suggested first by Thomas Aquinas.) The gift of <span class="accented">ministry</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) must be understood in a general sense, and not as having exclusive reference to the order of deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>), who were so called specifically because their office was one of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.

If any had a gift for any such kind of administrative work under others, they were to devote themselves to it, and be content if they could do it well. <span class="accented">Teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) may denote a gift for mere instruction in facts or doctrines, catechetical or otherwise, different from that of the inspired eloquence of <span class="accented">prophecy. Exhortation</span> (as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which bears also the sense of <span class="accented">consolation</span>, seems here to be rightly rendered) may be understood with reference to admonitory addresses, in the congregation or in private, less inspired and rousing than prophetic utterances. In <a href="../../par/acts/13-15.htm">Acts 13:15</a> the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> denotes the <span class="accented">exhortation</span> which any person in the synagogue might be called upon by the rulers to address to the people after the reading (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) of the Law and the prophets; cf. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>, where Timothy is told to give attendance to <span class="accented">reading</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), to <span class="accented">exhortation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), and to <span class="accented">teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). He <span class="accented">that giveth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) points to the gift of liberality, to the endowment with which both means supplied by Providence and a spirit of generosity might contribute. The almsgivers of the Church had their special gift and function; and they must exercise them in <span class="accented">simplicity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), which may perhaps mean singleness of heart, without partiality, or ostentation, or secondary aims. But in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-11.htm">2 Corinthians 9:11, 13</a>, the word seems to have the sense of <span class="accented">liberality</span>, and this may be the meaning here. "Uti Deus dat, Jac. 1:5" (Bengel). In the 'Shepherd of Hermas' (written, it is supposed, not later than the first half of the second century) <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is explained thus: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ('Hermae Pastor,' mandatum 2.). Possibly this gives the true original conception, from which that of general liberality would follow. [The idea that the almoners of the Church, rather than the almsgivers, are intended, viz. the deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>), is inconsistent with the general purport of the passage, as explained above. Besides, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means elsewhere to give up what is one's own, not to distribute the funds of others. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> might rather have been expected in the latter case (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/4-35.htm">Acts 4:35</a>).] <span class="accented">He that ruleth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) means, according to our view all along, any one in a leading position, with authority over others; and not, as some have thought, exclusively the <span class="accented">presbyters.</span> Such are not to presume on their position of superiority so as to relax in zealous attention to its duties. <span class="accented">He that showeth mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is one who is moved by the Spirit to devote himself especially to works of mercy, such as visiting the sick and succouring the distressed. Such a one is to allow no austerity or gloominess of demeanour to mar the sweetness of his charity. On the general subject of these gifts for various administrations (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 14; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>) it is to be observed that in the apostolic period, though presbyters and deacons, under the general superintendence of the apostles, seem to have been appointed in all organized Churches for ordinary ministrations (<a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 16:4; 20:17; 21:18; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>. l, 8; 5:17; <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), yet there were other spiritual agencies in activity, recognized as divinely empowered. The "prophets and teachers" at Antioch (<a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>) who, moved by the Holy Ghost, separated and ordained Barnabas and Saul for apostolic ministry, do not appear to have been what we should now call the regular clergy of the place, but persons, whether in any definite office or not, divinely inspired with the gifts of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. In like manner, the appointment of Timothy to the office he was commissioned to fill, though he was formally ordained by the laying on of hands of St. Paul himself (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>) and of the presbyters (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>), appears to have been accompanied - perhaps sanctioned - by <span class="accented">prophecy</span> (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>). Persons thus divinely inspired, or supposed to be so, appear, as time went on, to have visited the various Churches, claiming authority - some, it would seem, even the authority of <span class="accented">apostles</span>; the term "apostle" not being then confined exclusively to the original twelve; else Barnabas could not have been called one, as he is (<a href="../../par/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>), or indeed even Paul himself. But such claims to inspiration were not always genuine; and against false prophets we find various warnings (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Galatians 3:1; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 2 John 10 <a href="../../par/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>). Still, these extraordinary agencies and ministrations, in addition to the ordinary ministry of the presbyters and deacons, were recognized as part of the Divine order for the edification of the Church as long as the special <span class="accented">charismata</span> of the apostolic age continued. Afterwards, as is well known, the episcopate, in the later sense of the word as denoting an order above the general presbytery, succeeded the apostolate, though how soon this system of Church government became universal is still a subject of controversy. It appears, however, from 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), recently brought to light by Archbishop Bryennius (the date of which appears to have been towards the end of the first century or the beginning of the second), that the earlier and less regular system continued, in some regions at least (it does not follow that it was so everywhere), after the original apostles had passed away. For in this early and interesting document, while directions are given for the ordination (or election; the word is <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, the same as in <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>) of bishops and deacons in the several Churches, there is no allusion to an episcopate of a higher order above them, but marked mention of <span class="accented">teachers, apostles</span>, and <span class="accented">prophets</span> (especially the last two, <span class="accented">apostles</span> being also spoken of as <span class="accented">prophets</span>), who appear to have been itinerant, visiting the various Churches from time to time, and claiming authority as "speaking in the Spirit." To these <span class="accented">prophets</span> great deference is to be paid; they are to be maintained during their sojourn; they are to be allowed to celebrate the Eucharist in such words as they will (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>); while speaking in the Spirit they are not to be tried or proved (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-10.htm">1 Corinthians 14:10</a>; and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Romans 14:29), lest risk be run of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. Still, among these itinerants there might often be false prophets (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a> <a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>), and the Churches are to exercise judgment in testing them. If they taught anything contrary to the received doctrine; if they remained for the sake of maintenance without working for more than two days; if they asked in the Spirit for worldly goods for themselves; if their manner of life was not what it should be; - they were false prophets, and to be rejected, Similarly, in the 'Shepherd of Hermas' (apparently a document of the first half of the second century, and in some parts corresponding closely with the <span class="accented">Teaching</span>, from which such parts may have been derived) like directions are given for distinguishing between true and false prophets, between those who had <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x2c;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and those whose <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (mandatum 11.). And even in the 'Apostolical Constitutions' (a compilation supposed to date from the middle of the third to the middle of the fourth century) there is a passage corresponding to what is said in the <span class="accented">Teaching</span> about distinguishing between true and false <span class="accented">prophets</span> or <span class="accented">teachers</span> who might visit Churches (Romans 7:28). The <span class="accented">Teaching</span> seems to denote a state of things, after the apostolic period, in which the special <span class="accented">charismata</span> of that period were believed to be still in activity, though with growing doubts as to their genuineness in all cases. As has been said above, it does not follow that this order of things continued everywhere at the time of the compilation of the <span class="accented">Teaching</span>; but that it was so, at any rate in some parts, seems evident; and hence some light is thrown on the system of things alluded to in the apostolical Epistles. It is quite consistent with the evidence of the <span class="accented">Teaching to</span> suppose that in Churches which had been organized by St. Paul or other true apostles, the more settled order of government which soon afterwards became universal, and the transition to which seems to be plainly marked in the pastoral Epistles, already prevailed.

Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath</span>. The thought in ver. 19 seems to follow from what precedes. It may sometimes be impossible to he at peace with all; but at any rate, do not increase bitterness by avenging yourselves. <span class="accented">Give place unto wrath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>), has been taken by some to mean that we are to give scope to the wrath of <span class="accented">our enemy</span>, instead of being exasperated to resist it (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, etc.). But there has been no particular reference <span class="accented">to a wrathful</span> adversary. Another view is that our own wrath is intended, to which we are to allow time to expend itself before following its impulse; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> being taken as equivalent to <span class="accented">data spatium</span> in Latin (cf. Lactantius, 'De Ira,' 18, "Ego vero laudarem, si, cum fuisset iratus, <span class="accented">dedis-set irae suae spatium</span>, ut, residente per intervallum temporis animi tumore, haberet modum castigatio." Also Livy, 8:32, "Legati circumstantes sellam orabant, ut rem in posterum diem differret, et <span class="accented">irae suae spatium</span>, et consilio tempus <span class="accented">daret."</span> There seems, however, to be no known instance elsewhere of this use of the Greek phrase. Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, and most commentators, understand the meaning to be that we are to <span class="accented">give place to</span> the <span class="accented">wrath of God</span>, not presuming to forestall it. <span class="accented">The wrath</span>, used absolutely, might be an understood expression for the Divine wrath against sin (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>); and this interpretation suits the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It is not thus implied that the falling of Divine vengeance on our enemy should be our desire and purpose, but only this - that, if punishment <span class="accented">is</span> due, we must leave it to the righteous God to inflict it; it is not for us to do so. And this interpretation suits what immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">For it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, quoted freely from the Hebrew, but with the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> as found in the LXX. The fact that the same form of quotation occurs also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a> seems to show that it was one in current use). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (so rather than <span class="accented">wherefore</span>, as in the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head</span>. This whole verse is from <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21, 22</a>, where is added, "and the Lord shall reward thee." What is meant by the "coals of fire," both in the original and in St. Paul's citation, has been much discussed. Undoubtedly, the expression in itself, in view of its usual significance in the Old Testament, suggests only the idea of Divine vengeance (see <a href="../../par/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>; and especially 2 Esdras 16:53. Cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>); and this especially as it occurs here almost immediately after "Vengeance is mine." Hence Chrysostom and other Fathers, as well as some moderns, have taken it to mean that by heaping benefits on our enemy we shall aggravate his guilt, and expose him to severer punishment from God. But it is surely incredible that the apostle should have meant to suggest such a motive for beneficence; and the whole tone of the context is against it, including that of ver. 21, which follows. Jerome saw this, writing," Carbones igitur congregabis super caput ejus, non in maledictum et condemnationem, ut <span class="accented">plerique existimant</span>, sed in correctionem et poenitudinem." But if the "coals of fire" mean the Divine judgment on our enemy, there is nothing to suggest a corrective purpose. The view, held by some, that the softening effect of fire on metals is intended, is hardly tenable. Heaping coals of fire on a person's head would be an unnatural way of denoting the softening of his heart. More likely is the view which retains the idea of coals of fire carrying with it, as elsewhere, that of punishment and the infliction of pain, but regards the pain as that of shame and compunction, which may induce penitence. This appears to be the most generally received view. It is, however, a question whether any such effect is definitely in the writer's view. He may mean simply this: Men in general desire vengeance on their enemies, expressed proverbially by heaping coals of fire on the head. Hast thou an enemy? Do him good. This is the only vengeance, the only coals of fire, allowed to a Christian. Then follows naturally, <span class="cmt_word">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Insurrections against the government had consequently been frequent. There had been the notable one under Judas the Gaulonite of Gamala (called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>), who left followers behind him, called Gaulonites, and to whose tenets Josephus attributes all subsequent insurrections of the Jews ('Ant.,' 18:01. &sect; 1). Recently one had broken out in Rome, which had caused Claudius to order the expulsion of all Jews from the city (<a href="../../par/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; cf. Suetonius, 'Claud.,' 25; Din Cassius, 60:6). The Christians, being regarded as a Jewish sect, and known for their acknowledgment of a Messiah and their refusal to comply with heathen usages, were not unnaturally confounded with such disturbers of the peace (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-37.htm">Acts 21:37</a>). It was, therefore, peculiarly needful that the Christian communities should be cautioned to disprove such accusations by showing themselves in all respects good, law-abiding subjects. They might easily be under a temptation to be otherwise. Feeling themselves already subjects of Christ's new kingdom, and regarding the second advent as probably near at hand, they might seem to themselves above the powers and institutions of the unbelieving world, which were so soon to pass away. St. Paul himself condemned resort to heathen tribunals in matters which Christians might settle among themselves (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>, etc.); and many might go so far as to ignore the authority of such tribunals over the saints at all. Peter and John had at the first defied the authority even of the Sanhedrin in matters touching conscience (<a href="../../par/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>); and many might be slow to distinguish between temporal and spiritual spheres of jurisdiction. St. Paul, therefore, lays down the rule that the civil government, in whatsoever hands it might be, was, no less than the Church, a Divine institution for the maintenance of order in the world, to be submitted to and obeyed by Christians within the whole sphere of its legitimate authority. He does not refer to cases in which it might become necessary to obey God rather than man: his purpose here does not call on him to do so; nor were the circumstances so far such as to bring such cases into prominence; for he was writing in the earlier part of Nero's reign, before any general persecution of Christians had begun. Nor does he touch on the question whether it may be right in some cases for subjects to resist usurped power or tyranny, or to take part in political revolutions, and even fight for freedom. Such a question was apart from his subject, which is the general duty of obedience to the law and government under which we are placed by Providence. This is the only passage in which he treats the subject at length and definitely. In a doctrinal and practical treatise like this Epistle, addressed as an <span class="accented">apologia pro fide sua</span> to the metropolis of the world and the seat of government, it was fitting that he should express clearly the attitude of the Church with regard to the civil order. But his teaching in other Epistles is in accordance with this; as where (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>) he bids slaves acquiesce in the existing law of slavery, and (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, etc.) he desires especially prayers to be made in behalf of kings and rulers. And he himself notably carried out his principles in this regard (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/23-5.htm">Acts 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/25-8.htm">Acts 25:8-11</a>). There is a closely similar passage in the First Epistle of St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12-18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of</span> (rather, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God: the powers that be are ordained of God</span>. It is of God's ordering that there should be human governments and human laws. Without them there could be no order, security, or progress among mankind. Imperfect as they may often be, and in some instances oppressive and unjust, still they exist for a purpose of good, and form part of the Divine order for the government of the world. In this sense all are from God, and ordained of God; and in submitting to them we are submitting to God.

It is the theory of the laws of all civilized governments to uphold justice, and only to punish what is wrong; and in the main they do so. The principles of the Roman law were just, and Paul himself found protection from its officers and tribunals, whose fairness he had, and had reason to have, more confidence in than in the tender mercy of either Gentile or Jewish zealots (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 21:31, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 22:30; 24:10; 25:10, 11; 26:30, <span class="accented">seq.</span>).

So in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ideo enim et tributa praestatis.</span> The Christians, we may suppose, did pay all legal dues and taxes; it was a recognized principle that they were bound to do so; perhaps because of Christ himself having settled the question in his dictum about the tribute-money (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>).

In classical Greek it denotes peculiarly persons performing public duties, or works of public use.

There can be little, if any, doubt that the apostle had in view the second coming of Christ, which he with others supposed might be close at hand, Our Lord had said that of that day none knew but the Father (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it would come unexpectedly (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27, 37-44</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-36.htm">Mark 13:36</a>). Further, in the same addresses to the disciples before his death in which these things were said, he seems to have disclosed a vista of the future, after the manner of the ancient prophets, in which more immediate and more distant fulfilments of the prophetic vision were not clearly distinguished; so that words which we now perceive to have pointed to the destruction of Jerusalem, which was typical of the final judgments, might easily have been understood as referring to the latter. Such are, "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-30.htm">Mark 13:30</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22, 23</a>). Hence it was natural that the apostolic Church should regard the second advent as probably imminent. We find in the apostolic Epistles several intimations of this expectation (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>); and though it was not realized in the event, the authority of the apostles as inspired teachers is not thus disparaged, this being the very thing which Christ had said must remain unknown to all. Nor does their teaching, enforced by this expectation, lose its force to us; for, though "the Lord delayeth his coming," and may still delay it, yet to each of us at least this present world is fast passing away, and the Lord may be close at hand to call us out of it. The duty of watchfulness and preparedness remains unchanged. The <span class="accented">Parousia</span> or, as it is called in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="accented">Epiphany</span> (in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ is here, as elsewhere, presented under the figure of the day appearing (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>; l Thessalonians 5:4; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>), the previous ages of the world being regarded as the time of night.

He has already (<a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>) admonished his readers to be "of the same mind one toward another;" but, as was remarked under that verse, this did not imply agreement of view on all subjects, such as is impossible where there are many minds. In this chapter he recognizes the impossibility, having immediately before him what was then patent, the inability of some, through prejudice or slowness of conception, to enter into views of the meaning of the gospel which to himself and the more enlightened were apparent. He by no means departs from what he says elsewhere (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>) about no denial of fundamental doctrine being allowable in the communion of the Church; but in matters not touching the foundation he does here inculcate a large and generous tolerance. In these, as in all other relations between men on the earth together, the all-inspiring principle of <span class="accented">charity</span> is to rule. Who the "weak brethren" were whose scruples he especially inculcates tolerance of in this chapter cannot be decided positively. It will he seen that they were persons who thought it their duty to abstain from animal food, and perhaps also from wine (vers. 2, 21); and there is allusion also to observance of certain days (ver. 5). The views that have been taken are as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That they were the same class of Jewish Christians as are spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. as over-scrupulous about eating of things that had been offered in sacrifice to idols. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That they were such as were scrupulous in avoiding unclean meats, forbidden in the Mosaic Law. (Or, as Erasmus and others suggest, views (1) and (2) may be combined.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That they were <span class="accented">ascetics.</span> In favour of view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the fact that the drift and tone of the exhortation is exactly the same here as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>, with similarity also of expressions, such as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Against it are the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that in the chapter before us there is no allusion whatever to idol-meats, as there is throughout so markedly in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that abstinence from all animal food whatever (and apparently from wine too) is spoken of in this chapter. Objection (<span class="accented">a</span>) has been met by saying that the ground of the scrupulosity referred to might be so well known that St. Paul did not think it necessary to mention it when he wrote to the Romans. To objection (<span class="accented">b</span>) it is replied that there might be some who, in order to guard against the risk of buying at the shambles, or partaking in general society of viands connected with heathen sacrifices, made a point of abstaining from meat altogether, and (it has been suggested) from wine too, which might have been used in libations. This is the view of Clement of Alexandria, Ambrosiastor, and Augustine, among the ancients. View (2) is that of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Jerome, and others, among whom Chrysostom accounts for the <span class="accented">total</span> abstinence from meat as follows: "There were many of the Jews that believed, who, being still bound in conscience to the Law, even after believing still observed the ordinances about meats, not as yet venturing to depart from the Law; and then, in order not to be conspicuous in abstaining from swine's flesh only, they abstained from all flesh, and ate herbs only, that their practice might seem to be rather fasting, and not observance of the Law" (so also OEcumenius and Theophylact). But this seems to be a conjecture only, and hardly a likely one. And further, it fails to account for abstinence from wine, which seems to be implied; on the part of tome at least, in ver. 21. (It may be observed, however, that this is not of necessity implied. Abstinence from meat is all that has been spoken of before, and again in ver. 23; and St. Paul may possibly mean only to say, in ver. 21, that if by abstaining from wine also he could avoid offence to a weak brother, he would willingly so abstain. Still, the natural inference is that he would not have mentioned wine had there not been some who made it a point of conscience to abstain from it.) If the weak brethren were ascetics, according to view (3), it is most probable that they were Jewish Christians who had imbibed the principles of the <span class="accented">Essenes</span>. These were a Jewish sect, spoken of especially by josephus, who aimed at scrupulous observance of the Law of Moses, and strict personal purity. With this view they lived in communities under rule, partaking of the simplest fare, and some abstaining from marriage. It does not appear that they were strict vegetarians when living in community; but we are told that they might only eat such meat as had been prepared by their own members, so as to be secure against any pollution, and that, if excommunicated, they were consequently compelled to eat herbs. (For what is known of them, see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2; 8:2-5; 'Ant.,' 13:05. 9; 15:10. 4, 5; 18:1. 2, etc.; Philo, 'Quod Omnis Probus Liber,' see. 12, etc.; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 5:16, 17.) It is far from unlikely that some of these would be attracted to Christianity; and this especially as some of their principles, as described by Josephus, seem to have been endorsed by Christ himself (see art. on "Essenes," in 'Dict. of Christian Biog.,' vol. 2. p. 202); and, if so, they would be likely to carry their prejudices with them into the Church, and, when living outside their original communities, they might abstain entirely from flesh as well as wine. Or it might be that other Jews, Essenic in principle and feeling, had sought admission into the Church. Philo, in Eusebius, 'Praep. Evan.,' 8. fin., and Josephus, 'Vit.,' 2. 3, intimate that supra-legal asceticism, under the influence of Essenic principles, was not uncommon in Judaism in their time. The latter (c. 3) speaks of certain priests, his friends, who were so God-fearing that they subsisted on figs and nuts, and (c. 2) of one Banns, who had been his master, who ate no food but vegetables. What is still more to our purpose is that we find evidence of pious ascetics of the same type subsequently among Christians. Origen ('Contra Cels.,' 5:49) speaks of some as living in his time; and even the apostle St. Matthew, and James the Lord's brother, were afterwards credited with a corresponding mode of life. Clement of Alexandria ('Paedag.' 2:1) says of the former, "Matthew the apostle partook of seeds and acorns and herbs, without flesh." Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius (2:23), says of the latter that "he drank not wine or strong drinks, nor did he eat animal food; a razor came not upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil; he did not use the bath." It is to be observed that abstinence from ointments was one of the practices of the Essenes (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 8:2. 3). Augustine ('Ad Faust.,' 22:3) transmits the same tradition as to the abstinence of James from flesh and wine. Whatever foundation them might be for these traditions, they at any rate show that in the second century, when Hegesippus wrote, abstinence such as is intimated in this chapter was regarded as a mark of superior sanctity by some Christians. Farther, in the 'Apostolical Canons' (Canon 51.), Christians who abstained from marriage, or flesh, or wine, are allowed to be retained in the communion of the Church as long as they did so by way of religious restraint only. Against the above view of the weak brethren of the chapter before us having been ascetics of the Essenic type, is alleged the strong condemnation of persons supposed to have been of the same sort in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 16</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1-5</a>, which is said to be inconsistent with the tender tolerance recommended here. But the teachers referred to in the later Epistles, though inculcating practices similar to those of the "weak brethren," appear to have been heretical theosophists, the germ probably of later Gnosticism. Their tenets may indeed, in part at least, have been developed from Esseuism; but it was no longer mere conscientious scrupulosity, but principles subversive of the faith, that St. Paul set his face against in writing to the Colossians and to Timothy. Canon 51. in the 'Apostolical Canons' above referred to may be adduced as distinguishing between the principles on which asceticism might be practised allowably or otherwise; it being therein laid down that any who abstained from marriage, flesh, or' wine, not by way of religious restraint, but as abhorring them, forgetting that God made all things very good, and that he made man male and female, and blaspheming the work of creation, should be cast out of the Church. It remains to be observed that there was diffused among the Gentiles also, through the influence of the Neo-Pythagorean philosophy, an asceticism similar to the Essenic (see Senec., 'Ep.,' 108, and Porphyr., 'De Abstin.'), which Eichhoru supposes the "weak brethren" of this chapter to have been affected by, regarding them as mostly Gentile Christians. But Jewish influences are much more probable; the scruples referred to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. were certainly due to them; and observe ver. 5 in this chapter, which cannot but refer to Jewish observances. Further, Origen, in the treatise above referred to, expressly distinguishes between Christian and Pythagorean asceticism. His words are, "But see also the difference of the cause of the abstinence from creatures having life as practised by the Pythagoreans and by the ascetics among ourselves. For they abstain because of the fable concerning the transmigration of souls;...  but we, though we may practise the like, do it when we keep under the flesh and bring it into subjection" ('Contra Cels.,' 4). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that is weak in the faith</span> (rather, <span class="accented">in faith</span>, or <span class="accented">in his faith</span>).

The <span class="accented">standing</span> or <span class="accented">falling</span> here spoken of may be taken to mean standing firm in, or falling from, a state of grace (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 22</a>), rather than acceptance or rejection at the last judgment. "For God is able," etc., seems to require this meaning. The non-abstainer's freedom does not endanger his position; for God is powerful to sustain him, and to God alone he is accountable.

But a comparison with <a href="../../par/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> suggests rather a general reference to days of observance under the Jewish Law. The same class of weak brethren with Jewish prejudices that was scrupulous about meats would be likely to be also scrupulous about days and seasons and if scruples on the latter head seem to be mentioned only incidentally in this chapter, it may be because the others were at that time mainly conspicuous, and threatening to disturb the peace of the Church. One view that has been taken is that this short allusion to observance of days is introduced only in the way of illustration and argument; it being supposed that difference of practice with regard to days <span class="accented">was</span> allowed without dispute, and that what St. Paul means to say is, "You do exercise mutual tolerance in this matter extend the same principle to the matter of meats, to which it is equally applicable. This view of the meaning of the passage would derive support from the reading of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> at the beginning of ver. 5, which rests on fair authority. The supposed reference to Jewish days of obligation in general is.. not inconsistent with the apparent condemnation of the observance of such days by Christians in <a href="../../par/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>. and Colossians it. For see what has been said above about the drift of <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> and of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, etc. When the observances came to be insisted on as obligatory on principle, it was a different thing from mere conscientious scrupulosity. <span class="cmt_word">Let every man be fully persuaded</span> (for the verb in this sense, cf. <a href="../../par/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in his own mind</span>. To St. Paul himself the observance or non-observance of the days referred to was a matter in itself of no importance. He was content that each person should act up to his own conscientious convictions on the subject.

Both parties are supposed to be equally desirous of serving God. The eater of whatsoever is set before him is so, as is shown by his thanking God for it - observe "for he giveth," etc. - and no creature of God can be polluting "if received with thanksgiving" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>); the abstainer gives thanks too; and so his dinner of herbs is also hallowed to him. (Though it is not necessary to confine the thought to the practice of saying grace before meat, this is doubtless in view as expressing the asserted thankfulness. For proof of the custom, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4, 5</a>.) The general principle on which, in eating and drinking, as in all beside, Christians are of necessity supposed to act, and which both parties are to be credited with desiring to carry out, is set forth in vers. 7, 8, 9, which follow.

SUPPLEMENTARY. (See summary of contents, p. 16.) Questions have been raised and much discussed as to the connection of the last two chapters, 15. and 16, with the rest of the Epistle. The facts and the opinions founded on them may be summarized as follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is sufficient proof that in early times copies of the Epistle existed without these two chapters. The evidence is this - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Origen (on <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) speaks of some copies in his time being without the concluding doxology, and also without any part of these two chapters, attributing the omission to Marcion, for his own purposes, having mutilated the Epistle. His words are, "Caput hoc (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) Marcion, a quo scripturae evangelicae et apostolicae interpolatae sunt, de hac Epistola penitus abstulit; et non solum hoe, sod ab hoc loco ubi scriptum est, Omne autem quod non ex fide est peccatum est (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>) usque ad finem cuncta dissecuit." Tertullian also ('Contra Marcion') speaks of Marcion having mutilated this Epistle, though not specifying these two chapters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In Codex Amiatinus (a manuscript of the Latin Bible of the sixth century) there is a prefixed table of contents, referring by numbers to the sections into which the Epistle was divided, and describing the subject of each section. In this table the fiftieth section is thus described: "On the peril of one who grieves his brother by his meat," plainly denoting <a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-23</a>; and the next and concluding section is described thus: "On the mystery of the Lord kept secret before his Passion, but after his Passion revealed," which description can only refer to the doxology of <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>. Hence it would seem that in some Latin copy of the Epistle to which the table of contents referred, the doxology followed <a href="../../par/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a> with nothing between. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Cyprian. who quote largely from the Epistle, have no references to ch. 15. and 16. It may be observed, however, that mere omission to quote is not in itself conclusive, though it may be corroborative of other evidence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The concluding doxology (<a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>), though placed, as in the Textus Receptus, at the end of ch. 16. in the uncials generally and by the Latin Fathers, is found at the end of ch. 14. in the uncial L, in most cursives, in the Greek Lectionaries, and is so referred to by the Greek commentators. Some few manuscripts have it in both places, and some few omit it altogether. Origen also (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) says that in some copies of the Epistle which contained ch. 15. and 16, the doxology was placed at the end of ch. 16, and in others at the end of ch. 14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In one manuscript (G) all mention of Rome in the Epistle is omitted; and in one cursive (47) there is a marginal note to the effect that "some one" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably, some commentator) makes no mention of the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span> either in the interpretation or the text. In view of these facts, it may be held that the Epistle, as first written, ended at ch. 14. with the doxology appended, ch. 15. and 16. (ending at ver. 24 with the usual concluding benediction, "The grace," etc.) having been an addition. Baur, after his manner - and this partly on supposed internal evidence - disputes the two last chapters having been written by St. Paul at all, regarding them as an addition by a later hand. But his reasons are too arbitrary to stand against the authority of existing manuscripts, to say nothing of the internal evidence itself, which really appears to us to tell the other way. Such internal evidence will appear in the course of the Exposition. One view, put forth by Ruckert, and recently supported by Bishop Lightfoot (<span class="accented">Journal of Philology</span>, 1871, No. 6), is that St. Paul, having originally written the whole Epistle, including the two chapters, but without the doxology, reissued it at a later period of his life in a shortened form for general circulation, having then appended the doxology. This theory, however, is but a conjecture, put forward as best accounting for all the facts of the case, including that of all mention of Rome having been apparently absent from some copies. This, however, might be accounted for by the Epistle having been issued, after St. Paul's time, in a form suited for general circulation. On the whole, we may take it as probable that the apostle, having first concluded his Epistle with ch. 14. and the doxology, felt himself urged to resume a subject which lay so near his heart, and so appended ch. 15, and then the salutations, etc., in ch. 16, before the letter was sent. This supposition would in itself account for copies of the Epistle having got into circulation without the additions to it. Possibly Marcion took advantage of finding some such copies to deny the genuineness of the two final chapters altogether; and his doing so would be likely to promote circulation of the shorter copies. It will be observed that the Epistle, as a doctrinal treatise practically applied, is complete without the last two chapters; and also that ch. 15, though connected in thought with the end of ch. 14, might be, and indeed reads like, a resumption and further enforce-merit of its ideas. It seems, indeed, as if three appendices, or postscripts, had been added by the apostle; the first ending with the benediction of <a href="../../par/romans/15-33.htm">Romans 15:33</a>; the second (commending Phoebe, who was to be the bearer of the letter, and sending salutations to persons at Rome) with the benediction of <a href="../../par/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; and the third (which might be added at the last moment) with that of <a href="../../par/romans/16-24.htm">Romans 16:24</a>. All the benedictions are thus accounted for, being the apostle's usual concluding authentications (cf. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>). As to the proper position of the doxology, if the view last given be correct, its original one would be most naturally at the end of ch. 14; since otherwise the Epistle, as first completed, would have nothing answering to the usual benedictions in conclusion. And though this is not a benediction, but a doxology, embodying in solemn terms the main idea of the preceding treatise, such a conclusion is in keeping with the peculiar character of the Epistle to the Romans. Finally, though uncial authority is decidedly in favour of the position of the doxology at the end of ch. 16, this does not seem to be a sufficient reason for con-eluding it to have been originally there. If there existed anciently two editions, one with, and the other without, the two chapters appended, transcribers of the longer edition would be likely to place the doxology at the end of what they believed to be the true conclusion of the original Epistle. After all, the question cannot be considered as settled. It has been deemed sufficient here to state the main arguments for or against the various views that have been taken. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - H. <span class="accented">Renewed admonition to bear with the weak, enforced by Scripture and the example of Christ.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We then</span> (rather, <span class="accented">but we</span>, or <span class="accented">now we.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> here certainly seems to link this chapter to the preceding section; but it is not inconsistent with the chapter being an addition to a completed letter, of which it takes up the concluding thought) <span class="cmt_word">that are strong</span> (St. Paul, here as elsewhere, identifies himself with the more enlightened party) <span class="cmt_word">ought</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> expresses <span class="accented">obligation of duty</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to bear the infirmities of the weak</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and not to please ourselves.

This verse, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, gives the reason why the words of the ancient psalmist are adduced for the instruction of Christians. Christ, it is said, exemplified the principle of it, and it is for us to do so too. By bearing the infirmities of the weak, and submitting, if need be, to reproach, we exhibit Christ-like <span class="accented">endurance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span>), such as Scripture inculcates; and therewith will come <span class="accented">comfort</span>, such as Scripture contains and gives, and so a strengthening of our <span class="accented">hope</span> beyond these present troubles. The psalm quoted was peculiarly one of endurance and comfort under vexations and reproaches, and of <span class="accented">hope</span> beyond them. It was written afore-time for our instruction, that so it may be with us, as it was with Christ. In the next verse the apostle returns definitely to the subject in hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the God of patience and comfort</span> (the same word as before, though here in the Authorized Version rendered <span class="accented">consolation</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>grant</span> <span class="cmt_word">you to be like-minded</span> (see on Romans 12:16<span class="cmt_word">), one with another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one accord with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (so certainly, rather than, as in the Authorized Version, "God, even the Father of," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore receive ye one another</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1</a>, and note<span class="cmt_word">), even as Christ also received us</span> (or <span class="accented">you</span>, which is better supported, and, for a reason to be given below, more likely) <span class="cmt_word">to the glory of God.</span> As in ver. 3, the example of Christ is again adduced. The connection of thought becomes plain if we take the admonition, "Receive ye one another," to be mainly addressed to "the strong," and these to consist principally of Gentile believers, the "weak brethren" being (as above supposed) prejudiced Jewish Christians. To the former the apostle says, "Receive to yourselves with full sympathy those Jewish weak ones, even as Christ, though sent primarily to fulfil the ancient promises to the house of Israel only (see ver. 8), embraced you Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) also within the arms of mercy" Thus the sequence of thought in ver. 8, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, appears. "Unto the glory of God" means "so as to redound to his glory." Christ's receiving the Gentiles was unto his glory; and it is implied that the mutual receiving of each other by believers would be so too. The idea of God's glory being the end of all runs through the whole passage (cf. vers. 6, 9, 11).

Christ's primary <span class="accented">ministry</span> was to "the house of Israel" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), in vindication of God's <span class="accented">truth</span>, or faithfulness to his promises made through the patriarchs to the chosen race: his taking in of the Gentiles was an extension of the Divine <span class="accented">mercy</span>, to his greater glory. The infinitive <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 9, seems best taken in the same construction with <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 8, both being dependent on <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>. As it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name. This quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a> or <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-50.htm">2 Samuel 22:50</a>, with those that follow, are for scriptural confirmation of God's purpose, which has just been spoken of, to include the Gentiles in his covenanted mercies to Israel, so that they too might glorify him. St. Paul, after a manner usual with him; follows cut a thought suggested in the course of his argument, so as to interrupt the latter for a while, but to return to it in ver. 13. All, in fact, from the beginning of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 12, is parenthetical, suggested by "even as Christ received you,." at the end of ver. 7. All this, it may be observed, is confirmatory of Pauline authorship. The first quotation introduces David, the theocratic king, confessing and praising God, not apart from the Gentiles, but among them. The second, from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, calls on the Gentiles themselves to join in Israel's rejoicing; the third, from <a href="../../par/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, does the same; the last, from <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, foretells definitely the reign of the Messiah over Gentiles as well as Jews, and the hope also of the Gentiles in him.

It is St. Paul's courteous as well as kindly way to compliment those to whom he writes on what he believes to be good in them, and to cling to a good opinion of them, even where he has some misgivings, or has had reason to find fault (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 7:3, <span class="accented">seq</span>.).

"Ye yourselves also" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) implies his trust that even without such warnings they would of themselves be as he would wish them to be; "full of goodness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), so as to be kind to one another, as they were enlightened and replete with knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>).

Though the Church of Rome was not one of his own foundation, and he had no desire, there or elsewhere, to build on another man's foundation (ver. 20), yet his peculiar mission as apostle to the Gentiles gave him a claim to admonish them. The reason thus given is, it will be observed, a confirmation of the view, otherwise apparent, that the Roman Church consisted principally of Gentile believers.

Here they are evidently used in their sacrificial meaning, but applied metaphorically; the "acceptable offering" which Paul offers to God is that of the Gentiles whom he brings to the faith. "The preaching of the gospel he calls a sacrificial service (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>), and genuine faith an acceptable offering" (Theodoret). "This is my priesthood, to preach and to proclaim" (Chrysostom); cf <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>.

St. Paul's purpose in this and the four following verses is to allege proof of his being a true apostle with a right to speak with authority to the Gentiles. It is evident, he says, from the extent and success of my apostolic labours, and the power of God that has accompanied them. So also, still more earnestly and at length, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>. and 12. As to his reason for frequently thus insisting on his true apostleship, and for asserting it in writing to the Romans, see note on Romans 1:1. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought through me unto the obedience of the Gentiles (meaning, I will not dare to speak, of any mere doings of my own, but only of those in which the power of Christ working through my ministry has been displayed) <span class="cmt_word">by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> displays of miraculous power. It is noteworthy how St. Paul alludes incidentally in his letters to such "signs and wonders" having accompanied his ministry, as to something familiar and acknowledged, so as to suggest the idea of their having been more frequent than we might gather from the Acts of the Apostles. Had the alleged "signs and wonders" been unreal, we might have expected them to be made more of in the subsequent narrative of an admirer than in contemporary letters), <span class="cmt_word">by the power of the Spirit of God</span> (al. <span class="accented">the Holy Spirit.</span> This power, if taken as distinct from that of <span class="accented">signs and wonders</span>, may denote the power of the Holy Spirit displayed in the conversion of believers, and the gifts bestowed upon them); <span class="cmt_word">so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached</span> (literally, <span class="accented">I have fulfilled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the gospel of Christ</span>. In thus designating the sphere of his ministry the apostle is denoting its local extent, rather than the course he had taken. He had, in fact, preached first at Damascus (<a href="../../par/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>), and afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a>); but he mentions Jerusalem first, as being the original home of the gospel in the East, and, indeed, the first scene of his own preaching in fellowship with the original apostles. Thence he had extended it in various quarters (for the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> - trans. "round about" - cf. <a href="../../par/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>), and carried it into Europe, Illyricum being the western limit so far reached. It is true that there is no mention in the Acts of his having actually visited Illyria. In the journey of <a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. he plainly got no further west than Betted, which is, however, not far off; and he might possibly mean here only to say that he had extended the gospel to the borders of Illyricum, but for the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and his seeming to imply afterwards (ver. 23) that he had gone as far as he could in those regions, and consequently contemplated a journey to Spain. Hence, the narrative of Acts not being an exhaustive history, it may be supposed that he had on some occasion extended his operations from Macedonia to Illyricum, as he may well have done on his visit to the latter mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1-3</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> allows for a visit into Illyricum.

In the compact between St. Paul and the apostles of the circumcision referred to in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1-7</a>, it was agreed that he should confine his apostolic ministry to the Gentiles. Consequently, we find him selecting as centres of his work the principal cities of the heathen world. But he was further careful to avoid places, wherever they might be, in which Churches were already founded. It was the function of an apostle to extend the gospel by founding new Churches, rather than to invade the provinces of others. Those founded by himself, and thus under his immediate jurisdiction, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Corinthian Church, he visited as need arose, and addressed them in authoritative letters, commanding as well as exhorting. But his rule in this respect did not preclude his writing also letters of general encouragement and admonition to any whom his peculiar commission as apostle of the Gen- tiles gave him a claim to be heard by. Thus he wrote to the Colossians, though he had never seen them (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>); and thus also to the Romans, at the same time (as we have seen, <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, seq.) almost apologizing for doing so; and, though he proposes visiting them, it is nor with the view of staying among them long, so as to take up the superintendence of them, but only on his way to Spain for mutual comfort and edification (see <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>).

The hindrance had been, mainly at least, as is evident from <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f7c;</span> (ver. 22), the obligation he was under of completing his ministry in the first place in other quarters (see on Romans 1:13). <span class="cmt_word">But now having no longer place in these regions</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the context, there being no additional sphere for my activity there. He had now planted the gospel in all the principal centres, leaving disciples and converts, and probably an ordained ministry, to carry on the work and extend it in the regions round. In this his proper apostolic work consisted; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</a><span class="cmt_word">), and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company</span>. The sense of this verse is no way affected by the omission of "I will come unto you," which authorities are against retaining. If "for," after this omission, be retained, the sentence is incomplete, as St. Paul's sometimes are. The omission of "for" (for which there is some little authority) leaves the sentence improved. The apostle's selection of Spain as his next intended sphere of labour might be due to the notoriety of that Roman province, and the facility of communication with it by sea. His omission of Italy, except for a passing visit, is accounted for by his principle, already enunciated, of not building on other men's foundation, there being already a flourishing Church at any rate at Rome. He hoped, as appears from this verse, that some of the members of it might join him in his mission to Spain. For the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would imply their going all the way in the case of a sea-voyage.

So man proposes, but God disposes, and all for final good (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.). That he afterwards carried out his intention of visiting Spain cannot be alleged with certainty, though there is distinct evidence of an early tradition that he did so (Canon Muratori, Eusebius, Jerome, Theodoret. Cf. Clem. Romans, Ep. 1, who speaks of St. Paul having gone to "the boundaries of the West"). Certainly before the end of his detention at Rome he had given up any idea he might have had of going thence at once to Spain; for cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>; which Epistles are believed, on good grounds, to have been written during that detention. Still, he may have gone during the interval between his release and his final captivity at Rome, during which the pastoral Epistles were probably written. In what follows (vers. 30-32) some apprehension of dangers attending his visit to Jerusalem, which might possibly thwart his intentions, already appears; sounding like an undertone allaying the confidence of the hope previously expressed. In the course of his progress to Jerusalem this apprehension appears to have grown upon him; for see <a href="../../par/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22, 23, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-4.htm">Acts 21:4, 11-14</a>).

She appears to have had business, perhaps of a legal kind, that took her to Rome; and St. Paul took advantage of her going to send the letter by her, desiring also to enlist the aid of her fellow-Christians at Rome in furtherance of her business, whatever it might be. Her having business at Rome, and her having been "a succourer of many," suggests the idea of her being a lady of means. Her designation as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Church at Cenchrea probably implies that she held an office there corresponding to that of <span class="accented">deaconess</span>, though there is no reason to suppose the distinguishing term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> to have been as yet in use. Her function, and that of others (as perhaps of Tryphena and Tryphosa, mentioned in ver. 12 as "labouring much in the Lord"), might be to minister to the sick and poor, and to fulfil such charitable offices as women could best discharge. Cf. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, mentioned in the midst of directions as to the qualifications of <span class="accented">men</span> for the office of deacons, probably denotes <span class="accented">women</span> who fulfilled similar duties. Cf. also Pliny's celebrated letter to Trajan (circ. A.D. 107), in which he says that he had extorted information as to the doings of Christians, "ex duabus ancillis, quae <span class="accented">ministrae</span> dicebantur." The Latin <span class="accented">ministra</span> answers exactly to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Cenchrea was the port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf; and it appears from this passage that there was a Church or congregation there, as well as one or more in Corinth itself. It is an interesting conjecture that St. Paul, in speaking of Phoebe having been a succourer of himself as well as of others, may refer to an illness of his own at Cenchrea, during which she had ministered to him, and that his shaving his head at Cenchrea because he had a vow (<a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>) may have been during, or on his recovery from, that illness.

And greet the Church that is in their house.</span> For other notices of them, el. <a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2, 18, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>; whence we learn that Aquila was a Jew of Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had been settled at Rome, whence, when the Jews were expelled by Claudius, they had gone to Corinth, where St. Paul found them on his first visit to that city; that St. Paul abode with them there, working with Aquila at tent-making, which was the croft of both; that they left Corinth with St. Paul for Syria, and were for a time left by him at Ephesus, where they instructed Apollos on his arrival there; that, when St. Paul wrote from Ephesus his First Epistle to the Corinthians, they sent greetings by it, having then a congregation of Christians which assembled at their house; that, having returned to Rome when the Epistle to the Romans was written, their house there also was made available for the same purpose; and that, when St. Paul was for the last time a prisoner at Rome before his martyrdom, they were once more living at Ephesus. They were probably in good circumstances, having had both at Rome and Ephesus houses large enough to be used as churches; and they were evidently leading and active members of the Christian community. It would seem that Priscilla, the wife, was especially so, and she may have been, like Phoebe, officially employed; for though, when they are first mentioned (<a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>) as having lately come to Corinth, and when they themselves send greetings to Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>), Aquila's name naturally comes first, yet St. Paul in all other mention of them reverses the order. The occasion of their having apparently risked their own lives in defence of St. Paul is unknown. It may have been at Corinth at the time of the Jewish insurrection against him (<a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>), or at Ephesus at the time of the tumult raised by Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="../../par/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a>, etc.), when St. Paul had been in imminent danger. The phrase, "laid down their neck" (not, as in the Authorized Version, "necks"), seems only to denote, figuratively, . "exposed their lives to danger." It appears, from the large number of greetings which follow, that there were now many Christians at Rome known to, or any rate known of by, the apostle. It does not follow that he was acquainted with all of them personally. He may have heard of them in the frequent inquiries he had doubtless made about the Roman Church (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). Many of them, however, he evidently knew, and with some had been associated. It was likely that many known to him in various quarters might have had occasion to resort to Rome. There are in all twenty-six individuals to whom greetings are sent, together with two households of slaves, and probably three congregations, as will appear below. <span class="cmt_word">Salute</span> (or, as before, <span class="accented">greet</span>. The verb is the same as before, and so throughout the chapter) <span class="cmt_word">my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Asia</span> (certainly so, rather than <span class="accented">Achaia</span>, probably introduced into the text from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>) <span class="cmt_word">unto Christ</span>. <span class="accented">Asia</span> means the proconsular province so called, being the western part of Asia Minor, of which the capital was Ephesus. Epaenetus may have been St. Paul's own first convert there during his second missionary journey (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>). The fact of the apostle having been then "forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia" does not preclude there having been converts thence.

There are in all five persons so designated in this chapter. The designation "fellow-prisoners" implies that these two had been, like himself, at some time imprisoned for the faith, but it does not fellow that he and they had been in prison together. If, in speaking of them as "of note among the apostles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)," he means to designate them as themselves apostles, this is an instance of a wider use of the term "apostle" than is generally understood (see note under Romans 12:6, etc.). The phrase, however, will bear the interpretation that they were persons held in honour in the circle of the original twelve. The term, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is certainly often used distinctively of them, as in <a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a> and in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, by St. Paul himself, the reference in both texts being to his own relations to them; and so here, speaking of two persons, who he also says had been in Christ before himself, he may only mean to point to their having been, as they still were, distinguished in association with the original apostles even before his own conversion.

This Narcissus may possibly have been the powerful freedman of Claudius, mentioned by Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 11:29, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 12:57; and by Suetonius, 'Claud.,' 28. The fact that he appears from 'Ann.,' 13:1, to have been put to death on the accession of Nero, A.D. 54, is not inconsistent with the supposition. For his human chattels would be likely to pass into the possession of Nero, and so become part of Caeasar's household, and might still be called by their late master's name. This may also have been the case with the household of Aristobulus above referred to. It is observable that, at a later period, the apostle, writing from Rome to the Philippians, sends special greetings from them "that are of Caesar's household" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-23.htm">Philippians 4:23</a>).

All these seem to have been Church workers; and the last at least, from the way St. Paul speaks of her, must have been known by him personally, and done work of which he was cognizant.

Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 85) speaks of it as exchanged before the Eucharist, and it is alluded to by many Fathers, directed in the 'Apostolical Constitutions,' and has its place in ancient liturgies (see Bingham, 15. 3:3). St. Paul, of course, in enjoining it here and in other Epistles, has in view the concord which it expressed. In sending salutations from "all the Churches of Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, omitted in the Textus Receptus, having authority decidedly in its favour), he may be understood as conveying to the Roman Christians the feeling towards them that had been expressed generally by the Churches he had visited. He may have spoken wherever he went of his intention of visiting Rome, and perhaps of meanwhile sending a letter thither; and the several Churches may have charged him with kind messages. Before authenticating these salutations with his usual autographic benediction, he feels bound to add one additional warning. The thought occurs to him, and he cannot but give expression to it. The warning is against a class of persons whose mischievous activity he had had experience of elsewhere, and attempts by some of whom to disturb the peace of the Roman Church he may possibly have heard cf. They may have been Judaists, or others who taught views contrary to the received faith, and so caused divisions and offences in the Churches. For allusions to such elsewhere, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Galatians 3:1, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>. For proof of such having been at work afterwards at Rome, cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Philippians 3:2, 17, <span class="accented">seq.</span>

Had St. Paul thought these people sincere though mistaken, he would doubtless have treated them with the tenderness he shows towards the weak brethren. But he regards them as self-interested, and of the flesh; and against such disturbers of the Church's peace he is, here as elsewhere, indignant (el. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11, 12</a>). In speaking of them as serving, or being slaves to, their own belly, it cannot be concluded certainly that he attributed to them habits of sensuality. He may only mean that it is the gratification of the lower part of their nature that they have in view; and there may be allusion to the motive of such persons being the desire of eating and drinking at the cost of the Churches. In 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' (alluded to under Romans 12:6, <span class="accented">seq</span>.) the desire to live without working at the cost of the Church is set down as one of the marks of a false apostle or a false prophet. <span class="cmt_word">And by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</span> (rather, <span class="accented">innocent</span>, or <span class="accented">harmless.</span> So the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is translated in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>.

St. Paul often elsewhere insists on the reality of his vocation from Christ himself to be an apostle to the Gentiles; and this with regard to disparagement of his claim to be a true apostle at all on the part of some (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>). It does not follow from his thus asserting his claim here and afterwards in this Epistle that he was aware of any disparagement of it at that time among the Roman Christians; still less that he wrote his Epistle with a polemical purpose against the Judaizers, as some have supposed. Still, he may have suspected that some might possibly have been busy there, as they were in other places; and, however that might be, writing as he was to a Church not founded by, and as yet unvisited by, himself, he might think distinct assertions of his claim to be heard desirable. <span class="cmt_word">Separated</span> (or, <span class="accented">set apart</span>) unto <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the gospel of God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the preaching of the gospel, not the reception of it only, as is evident from the context.

This intimation of the gospel being the fulfilment of prophecy is fitly introduced here, as preparing the reader for the argument of the Epistle, in the course of which the doctrine propounded is shown to be in accordance with the Old Testament, and in fact anticipated therein. This is, indeed, a prominent point in the general teaching of apostles and evangelists. They announce the gospel as the fulfilment of prophecy, and the true completion of all the ancient dispensation; and it is to the Old Testament that, in addressing Israelites, they ever in the first place appeal. Thus St. Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>); thus Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.); thus St. Paul at Antioch in Pisidia, at Thessalonica, and before Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6, 22</a>); thus Philip to the Ethiopian proselyte (<a href="../../par/acts/8-35.htm">Acts 8:35</a>); thus Apollos at Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>). Our Lord himself had done the same, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>. All this is important as showing how the old and new dispensations are regarded together as parts of a whole, the old one being but the needful preparation for a fulfilment in the new, and so becoming intelligible; and thus how "through all the ages one eternal purpose runs." There was also a providential preparation in the Gentile world, though not so direct and obvious, and though, of course, not similarly noticed in addresses to disciples of the Law. But St. Paul intimates it; as in his speech on Areopagus, and also, as will be seen, in this Epistle. Even the gospel (it may be further observed) is set forth as but a further stage of progress towards a final consummation, as the dawn only of a coming daybreak. We have still but an earnest of our inheritance; the "earnest expectation of the creature" still awaits "the manifestation of the sons of God." Meanwhile, in the revelation already made through Christ, and the redemption accomplished by him, we are taught to cling to our faith in a Divine purpose throughout the world's perplexing history - that of resolving at last all discords into eternal harmony, and making manifest "one great love, embracing all." This grand view of a providential order leading to a final consummation (though how and when we know not) pervades St. Paul's writings, and should be kept in mind for a proper understanding of this Epistle. God's promises through his prophets in Holy Scripture are said to have been "concerning his Son;" and a question hence arises as to the exact sense in which "his Son" is to be here understood; a consideration of which question may help our interpretation of the expression in the following verse, which is not without difficulty, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. We may distinguish between three senses in which Christ is called "the Son of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> With reference to his Divine pre-existence, the term expressing his relation to the Father from eternity, like the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (and probably the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> With reference to his incarnation, as being conceived by the Holy Ghost; as in <a href="../../par/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> With reference to the position assigned to the Messiah in psalm and prophecy, as the <span class="accented">Son</span> exalted to the right hand of God, and crowned with glory. It is with the last of these three references that the title is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews; where the ideal of sonship, found in the Old Testament, and imperfectly typified by the theoretic position of the theocratic kings, is regarded as prophetic, and pointing to Christ, in whom alone it is shown to be fulfilled. Hence in that Epistle his exaltation to the rank and dignity of <span class="accented">Son</span> is regarded as subsequent to his human obedience, and even the consequence and reward of it. It was "<span class="accented">because</span> <span class="accented">of</span> the suffering of death (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)" that he has been "crowned with glory and honour" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>); it was after he had made a purification of sins that he "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high," having "inherited" that "more excellent name" - the name of Son (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). It is by no means implied that the said Epistle does not recognize a true Sonship of Christ <span class="accented">before</span> his exaltation; he was all along "the Son" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.), though not enthroned as such over mankind and all creation till after his resurrection; and, further, the essential doctrine of his pre-existent and eternal Sonship. in the first of the senses noted above, is distinctly taught (as in ch. 1:3), though not there by the use of the term "Son." All we say is that this word is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews to denote Christ's position and office as the royal High Priest of humanity, exalted, after suffering, to the right hand of God, rather than his original Divine Personality; such being the significance of the title in the prophetic anticipations of the Messiah. Now, this being so, and it being the promises made "through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures concerning his Son" that are being spoken of in the passage before us, it may seem at first most probable that the idea here implied by the word "Son" is the same as in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and no more. We ought, however, to take further into account what St. Paul himself seems to signify by the term when he uses it elsewhere. It does not follow that his own conception of its significance was confined to what was apparent in "the prophets." Reading them in the light of the gospel revelation, he may have seen in their language more implied than it distinctly expressed, and himself intended to imply more. The passages in his Epistles, apart from this chapter, where Christ is called God's Son are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="../../par/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, "We were reconciled to God through the death of his Son;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "Sending his own <span class="accented">Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) in the likeness of flesh of sin;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "To be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the Firstborn among many brethren;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>, "Spared not his own Son (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>);" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>, "The Son of God...  was not Yea and Nay;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4, 6</a>, "God sent forth his Son," - "sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> <a href="../../par/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>, "Translates us into the kingdom of the Son of his love." In all these passages - except (3), in which the reference may be only to Christ in glory - the term "Son" denotes a relation (o the Father, peculiar to our Lord, previous to the death and exaltation, and in some of them, (2), (6), (7), previous to the Incarnation. Such previous relation is especially apparent in the sequence to (7), where "the Son of his love" is defined not only as "the Head of the body, the Church," and "the Firstborn from the dead," but also as "the Image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation; for in him all things were created, the things in heaven, and the things on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible; all things through him and unto him have been created." With this may be compared <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-12</a>, where an existence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, anterior to incarnation, is undoubtedly declared, though the exaltation after human obedience, and the receiving then of "a name that is above every name" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>), is spoken of as well. One other passage remains to be noticed, occurring, not in an Epistle, but in the sermon at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="../../par/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>), where the view of Christ's Sonship which is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews (no more being expressed) appears as present to St. Paul's mind. For there God is said to have "fulfilled the promise which was made unto the fathers, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the psalm, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." Here the Sonship assigned to "the Christ" in the second psalm is regarded as exhibited in the Resurrection. From this review of St. Paul's usage it may be inferred that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the text before us carries with it in his own mind the idea of pre-existent eternal Sonship, though what we may call Messianic Sonship may be all he means distinctly to intimate as declared by prophets. The bearing of this distinction on the interpretation of ver. 4 will appear under it. It may be observed here that the absence of a fixed and definite usage in the application of the term "Son" to Christ, which (as has been seen) is found in the New Testament, is what might be expected there. Formal definitions of theological conceptions by means of language used uniformly in a recognized definite sense had not as yet been made. Among such conceptions that of the Holy Trinity though implied, is nowhere distinctly formulated as a dogma. It was reserved for the Church, under the guidance of the Spirit, to preclude misconception by precise dogmatic definitions.

His having come humanly "of the seed of David" is suitably noted here, where "the Son" is being set forth as fulfilling the Old Testament promises; for they uniformly represent the Messiah as thus descended, and it was essential to the Jewish conception of him that he should be so (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>; and for the stress laid by the writers of the New Testament on the fact that Jesus was so - of which fact no doubt was entertained - cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, etc. See, among many other passages, <a href="../../par/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). Meyer, commenting on the verse before us, goes somewhat out of his way to set forth that only Joseph's, not Mary's, descent from David was in St. Paul's mind, saying that "the Davidic descent of the mother of Jesus can by no means be established from the New Testament," and also that "Paul nowhere indicates the view of a supernatural generation of the bodily nature of Jesus." As to the first of these assertions, it may be observed that, in the opening chapters of our Gospel of St. Luke (representing certainly the early belief of the Church) our Lord seems to be regarded as actually descended from David - not legally so accounted only - though, at the same time, his supernatural generation is distinctly asserted (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a> with Luke 1:35). Hence we are led to infer Mary's, as well as Joseph's, descent from David, whether or not either of the genealogies given in St. Matthew's and St. Luke's Gospels represents hers. Further, with respect to those two genealogies (evidently independent ones, and both probably got from genealogical records preserved at Jerusalem), a probable way of accounting for the two distinct lines of descent through which Joseph seems to be traced to David, is to suppose one of them to be really Mary's, the legal representative of whose family Joseph had become by marriage, so as to be entered in legal documents as the son of her father (see art. on "Genealogy of Jesus Christ," in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' W. Smith, LL.D.). As to Meyer's second assertion above alluded to, it is true that St. Paul nowhere refers to our Lord's supernatural conception spoken of in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. But it does not follow that it was not already included in the Church's creed, or that St. Paul himself was unaware of it or disbelieved it. This is not the place for enlarging on the evidence, at the present day increasing in force, of the early origin of our existing Gospels, and of their being a true embodiment of the Church's original belief. St. Paul's silence as to the manner how the Son of God became incarnate may be accounted for by his not having had occasion, in his extant Epistles, to speak of it. He is occupied, in accordance with his peculiar mission, in setting forth the meaning and purpose of the Incarnation rather than its mode, and in preaching rather than catechetical instruction; and on the essential idea involved he is sufficiently explicit, viz. the peculiar Divine paternity of Christ, notwithstanding the human birth.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means properly to "appoint" or "determine;" and if this meaning be re-mined, the whole passage would seem to preclude the idea of Sonship previous to the Resurrection being in view.

It is maintained that this use of the word, though unusual, is legitimate; since a person may be said to be appointed, or determined, to be what he already is, when his being such is declared and manifested. Thus, it may be said, a king may be spoken of as appointed king when he is crowned, though he was king before; or a saint determined a saint when he is canonized; and the classical phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of <span class="accented">deify</span>, is adduced as parallel. Thus the expression is made to mean that "the same who <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> was known only as the descendant of David, is now declared to be the Son of God" (Tholuck); <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f30;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Cyril); and St. Paul's reason for thus putting it, in pursuance of his course of thought, is thus explained by Meyer; "Paul gives the two main epochs in the history of the Son of God as they had actually occurred, and had been prophetically announced;" also by Bengel thus, "Etiam ante exinanitionem suam Filius Dei is quidem fuit: sed exinanitione filiatio occultata fuit, et plene demure retecta post resurrectionem." This interpretation would be more satisfactory than it is if the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> were found similarly used in any other part of the New Testament.

In both of these texts the word denotes God's <span class="accented">appointment</span> or <span class="accented">determination</span> of Christ to the office of Judge, not merely a <span class="accented">declaration</span> or <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of his already being so; and it is to be observed that in the second the language is given as that of St. Paul himself, and that it corresponds with the passage before us in that the Resurrection is spoken of as the display to the world of Christ being so appointed or determined. Surely, then, there ought to be cogent reason for giving <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> a different meaning here; and, in spite of the weight of authority on the other side, it is submitted that we are under no necessity to do so, if we bear in mind what appeared under ver. 3 as to the different senses in which Christ is designated <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In the sense apparent is Messianic prophecy, and pervading the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the sense which seems intended by St. Paul himself in <a href="../../par/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32, 33</a>, it was not till after the Resurrection that Christ attained his position of royal Sonship; it was then that the Divine <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> took effect in that regard. It is true that St. Paul (as was seen under ver. 3) himself conceived of Christ as essentially Son of God from eternity; but here, while speaking of the fulfilment of Messianic prophecy, and desiring to point out what was patent to all who believed that Christ had risen, he may fitly refer to his exaltation only, in virtue of which, further, he had himself received his apostolic commission, of which he proceeds to speak, and the assertion which he has had all along in view. The above interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> appears, further, to have the weighty support of Pearson, who, speaking of Christ's fourfold right unto the title of "the Son of God" - by generation, as begotten of God; by commission, as sent by him; by resurrection, as the Firstborn; by actual possession, as Heir of all - refers thus to <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>: 'Thus was he defined, or constituted, and 'appointed to be the Son of God with power by the Resurrection from the dead'", (Pearson on the Creed, art. 2.). <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (to be connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes the Divine power displayed in the Resurrection (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, "the exceeding greatness of <span class="accented">his power</span>,...  according to the working of the strength of his might, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead;" cf. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>).

Because of this "spirit of holiness" that was in Christ, "it was not possible that he should be holden of" death (<a href="../../par/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>). Through this, which was in himself - not merely through a Divine power external to himself calling him from the grave, as he had called Lazarus - he overcame death (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>, "Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption"). It was through this too (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) that he "offered himself without spot to God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>); and in the same sense may be understood <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>). Neither in these passages nor in the one before us is the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span> meant, in the sense of a distinct Person of the Holy Trinity. Further, the preposition in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not denote (as explained by Theodoret, Luther, and Grotius) the <span class="accented">time</span> from which the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> began in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, but the <span class="accented">source</span> out of which it proceeded. "<span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3ba;</span> non mode tempus, sed nexum rerum denotat" (Bengel). Further, the phrase is not "resurrection <span class="accented">from</span> the dead," as in the Authorized Version, but "<span class="accented">of</span> the dead," which may be purposely used so as to point, not only to the fact of Christ's own resurrection, but also to its significance for mankind. The same expression often occurs elsewhere with a comprehensive meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11</a>; also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The resurrection of Christ expressed "the power of an endless life," here and hereafter, for mankind, carrying with it the possibility of the resurrection of all from the dominion of death in the risen Son. One view of the meaning of the whole of the above passage - that of Chrysostom and Melancthon - may be mentioned because of the weight of these authorities, though it cannot be the true one. They take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, as co-ordinate, regarding them as the three proofs of Christ's eternal Sonship. <span class="accented">i.e. miracles, the communication of the Holy Ghost</span>, and <span class="accented">the resurrection. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord</span>; thus in conclusion distinctly identifying the Son of prophecy with the Jesus who had lately appeared, and was acknowledged by the Christians as the Messiah, and commonly by them called <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The force of the passage is weakened in the Authorized Version by the transposition of <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to the beginning of ver. 3, as also by the inclusion of ver. 2 in a parenthesis, so as to separate it from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> which follows. (See explanation given above.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his Name's sake</span>. "We" here means, not Christians generally, but Paul himself (though probably, as also in all other cases where he similarly uses this plural, with the intention of including others, here his fellow-apostles); for the "grace" spoken of is evidently from what follows a special grace for the apostolic office to which he had been called. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in a like sense in <a href="../../par/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., denotes the purpose of his apostleship, viz. to bring men everywhere, of whatever race, to believe and obey the gospel; not to a belief in it only, but to the obedience which comes of faith, or which faith renders. "Accepimus mandatum Evangelii ad omnes gentes pro-ferendi, cut illae per fidem obedient" (Calvin). Some take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, to mean "obedience <span class="accented">to</span> faith," faith being regarded, not as <span class="accented">cause efficiens</span>, but as a commanding principle exacting obedience to itself. So Meyer, who refers to passages where a genitive after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> has this meaning: <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); and also to <a href="../../par/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f58;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).

The question is, after all, of no importance with regard to the essential idea intended to be conveyed. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems to point especially to St. Paul's own apostleship (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 8</a>), though, of course, the apostleship of all, wherever exercised, had a similar worldwide purpose. In using the expression here, he anticipates what he is about to say as to his not shrinking from addressing even the Romans with authority; his mission being to <span class="accented">all</span> the nations. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is best connected with "obedience of faith." The phrase is of frequent occurrence (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>; also <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>). It is most usually connected with the idea of suffering in behalf of Christ.

Bengel's view, that by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> are specially meant the Jewish Christians, as being "beloved for the fathers' sakes" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>), and by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the Gentile converts, is untenable. Both phrases are applicable to all. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, be it observed, is elsewhere used to denote all Christians, without implying eminence in personal holiness (cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The union, here and elsewhere, of Jesus Christ with the Father as imparting heavenly blessing, implies his Deity no less than any dogmatic statement could do; for it is surely impossible to conceive the apostle thus associating with the Godhead one whom he regarded as a mere human being. The same form of benediction is found at the beginning of all St. Paul's Epistles, and there can be no doubt that its meaning is as given above. For, though here, in 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon, this collocation of words might allow the rendering, "Grace...  from God, the Father of us and of the Lord Jesus Christ," yet in Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus, it is obviously inadmissible. And even without these instances the true meaning would have been probable from <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> coming <span class="accented">before</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. If the apostle had intended to express a common Fatherhood of God, he would surely not have written, "Our Father and Christ's," but rather, "Christ's and ours" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>).

We observe here, as in other Epistles, St. Paul's way of beginning with complimentary language, and expression of thankfulness for the good he knew of in his readers. He thus intimates at the outset his own good feeling towards them, and predisposes them to take in good part any animadversions that may follow. "The whole world" is not, of course, to be taken literally, but as a phrase denoting general notoriety. Similarly in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>. Any considerable number of converts in so important a place as Rome would be likely to become notorious in all Christian circles, and even outside them might have already begun to attract attention.

It expresses the writer's earnestness, and is in place for attestation of a fact known only to himself and God. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, ("I serve"), when used in a religious sense, most usually denotes "worship," and specifically the priestly services of the temple (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).

All St. Paul implies is that he hopes to do them some spiritual good, so as to settle and strengthen them; and in the next verse, with characteristic delicacy, he even modifies what he has said, so as to guard against being supposed to imply that the benefit would be all on their side.

The spirit of delicate courtesy here evinced, in addressing persons over whom one loss of a Christian gentleman than St. Paul was might have assumed a lordly tone, is apparent elsewhere in his Epistles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-3.htm">2 Corinthians 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, seq.; 2 Corinthians 8:8; 9:2), and especially the whole Epistle to Philemon.

But the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> are too far separated to commend this view. It is more after St. Paul's style that there should be no apodosis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>; his train of thought carries him on so that he forgets how he began his sentence; and ver. 13 comes naturally as the sequence of ver. 12, whether we render <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "but," or (as in the Authorized Version) by "now," or (as in the Revised Version) by "and." The long-cherished intention here spoken of had been expressed by him when at Ephesus, before his departure to Macedonia (<a href="../../par/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>). Feeling himself to be peculiarly the apostle to the Gentile world, and having already been the first agent in carrying the gospel into Europe (<a href="../../par/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>), and having established it there in important centres of population, he ever kept in view an eventual visit to the imperial city itself, in the hope of its thence permeating the whole western world. What had so far hindered him appears from <a href="../../par/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> to have been principally missionary work which had first to be accomplished elsewhere. At last Providence carried him there in a way not of his own choosing. Thus man proposes, God disposes. In this verse the Roman Church seems certainly to be regarded as a Gentile one. What classes of converts probably at that time composed it has been considered in the Introduction. Whatever its nucleus, St. Paul plainly feels that, in sending this Epistle to it, he is carrying out his especial mission of extending the gospel to the Gentile world, though at the same time he writes mainly from a Jewish standpoint, appealing frequently to the Jewish Scriptures, with which he presupposes an acquaintance on the part of his readers. But the latter fact is not inconsistent with the supposition of their being, either then or prospectively, mainly of Gentile race. The gospel was everywhere preached as the fulfilment of Judaism (see note on ver. 2); and for understanding both its purport and its evidences, all would have to be to some extent indoctrinated in the ancient Scriptures. It is to be observed, too, that in the next verse the apostle implies a sense of now addressing a peculiarly civilized and cultivated community; he seems to have before him the prospect of his address reaching the educated and intelligent classes of society in the imperial city. And the Epistle, as it goes on, is in accordance with such an aim. For its arguments are addressed, not merely to believers in the Old Testament, but also generally to philosophical thinkers. The state of the world is reviewed, human consciousness is analyzed, deep problems which had long exercised the minds of philosophers are touched on, and the gospel is, in fact, commended to the world as God's answer to man's needs.

Here the Romans are intended to be included among <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, being partakers in Hellenic culture, and in fact at that time its prominent representatives (el. "Non solum <span class="accented">Graecia</span> et <span class="accented">Italia</span>, sod etiam omnis <span class="accented">barbaria</span>," Cicero, 'De Fin.,' 2:15). Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> also includes them. The obvious intention of the writer is to place them in each of the higher categories, and so, while after his manner he pays his expected readers a delicate compliment, to insist that his mission is to the highest in position and culture as well as the lowest, cud that, bold in his convictions, he is not ashamed to preach the cross even to them. "Audax facinus ad crucem vocare terrarum Dominos" (Alex. More. quoted by Olshausen).

In saying he was "not ashamed," St. Paul may have had in his mind our Lord's own words (<a href="../../par/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>.) We are reminded in this verse of the passage, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</a>, where the idea here shortly intimated is enlarged on. He was fully aware that the pride of Greek philosophy would be likely to despise the message of the cross as "foolishness." It would be strange to them at first, and out of accord with their intellectual speculations. But he was convinced too that in it was contained the one view of things to meet human needs, and such as to commend itself in the end to thinkers, if their consciences could be roused. In preaching to the Corinthians he had indeed purposely refrained from presenting the gospel to them in "words of man's wisdom," lest the simple message, addressed alike to all, should lose any of its essential power, or be confounded with the human philosophies of the day. But to them also, in his First Epistle, he declares that this was not because it was not "wisdom," as well as "power," to such as could so receive it. Among the more advanced, and therefore more receptive (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), he does, he says, "speak wisdom" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>), Christianity having, in fact, its own philosophy, appreciable by them. As is well said in the Exposition of 1 Corinthians in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "No contrast is here at all between reason and revelation, as some think, but strictly between two philosophies - the philosophy of God and the philosophy of the world." Therefore to the Greek, as well as to the Jew, he is not ashamed to preach the cross; and in this Epistle, suitably to its purpose - more, it may be supposed, than his ordinary preaching - he does set forth the Divine philosophy of the gospel. But the message, he adds, is "to the Jew first," because it was to the people of the covenant (cf. ch. 9:4, etc.) that the salvation in Christ was in the first place to be offered. Hence also, in all his missionary work, he first addressed himself to the synagogue, and only when he was rejected there, turned exclusively to the Gentiles. So at Rome too, when he afterwards went there (<a href="../../par/acts/28-17.htm">Acts 28:17-29</a>).

Further, we render, with the Authorized Version, "<span class="accented">the</span> righteousness of God," rather than "<span class="accented">a</span> righteousness," as in the Revised Version, notwithstanding the absence of the article. For what is meant is the definite conception, pervading the Epistle, of <span class="accented">God's righteousness.</span> If there were room for doubt, it would surely be removed by <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, also without the article, immediately following, and with the same verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

But "<span class="accented">a</span> wrath of God" has no intelligible meaning. The expressions seem simply to mean <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span> and <span class="accented">God's wrath.</span> This expression, "the righteousness of God," has been discussed in the Introduction, to which the reader is referred. Its intrinsic meaning is there taken to be God's own eternal righteousness, revealed in Christ for reconciling the world to himself, rather than (as commonly interpreted) the <span class="accented">forensic</span> righteousness (so called) imputed to man. Thus there is no need to understand the genitive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as <span class="accented">gen. auctoris</span>, or as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The phrase is understood in the sense that would be familiar to St. Paul and his readers from the Old Testament; and it is conceived that this intrinsic sense pervades the whole Epistle even when a righteousness imputed to <span class="accented">man</span> is spoken of; the idea still being that of the Divine righteousness embracing man. It is not clear in what exact sense <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to be understood. Most commentators, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> to denote man's imputed righteousness, connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with it, as if <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> had been written (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>). But the absence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span>, as well as the collocation of words, seems rather to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be meant to express the subjective condition for man's apprehension, and appropriation, of God's righteousness. The revelation of it to man's own soul is said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> while <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the result; viz. faith unto salvation. A like use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="../../par/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>.

The quotation from <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> seems mainly meant to illustrate what has been said concerning <span class="accented">faith</span>, though the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in it in connection with faith, may have also suggested it as apposite, as is evidently the case in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, where St. Paul quotes it in proof of the position that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>. The prophet had in immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time, and had cried, "LORD, how long?" But he had stood upon his watch to look out for what the LORD would say unto him; and an answer had come to him to the effect that, in spite of appearances, his prophetic vision would ere long be realized, God's promises to the faithful would certainly be fulfilled, and that <span class="accented">faith</span> meanwhile must be their sustaining principle - "The just shall live by his faith." So in the Hebrew. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (A.), or <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (B). The variations do not affect the general sense of the passage. Now some, supposing St. Paul to connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as part of the subject of the sentence, would accuse him of giving the quotation a meaning not intended by the prophet, who evidently meant <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> to go with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as part of the predicate. But there is no reason for attributing this intention to St. Paul, except on the supposition that he had previously connected <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. But we have seen reason for concluding that this was not so. The quotation, in the sense intended by the prophet, is sufficiently apposite. For it expresses that <span class="accented">faith</span> is the life-principle of God's righteous ones, while the whole passage at the end of which it occurs declares the salvation of prophetic vision to be entirely of God, to be waited for and apprehended by man through faith, not brought about by his own doings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18</span> - <a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>. - (1) <span class="accented">All mankind liable to God's wrath.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-32.</span> - (a) <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">heathen world in general.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold back the truth in unrighteousness. Here the argumentation of the Epistle begins, the first position to be established being that all mankind without exception is guilty of sin before God, and therefore unable of itself to put in a plea of <span class="accented">righteousness.</span> This being proved, the need of the revelation of <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span>, announced in ver. 17, appears. "The wrath of God" is an expression with which we are familiar in the Bible, being one of those in which human emotions are attributed to God in accommodation to the exigencies of human thought. It denotes his essential holiness, his antagonism to sin, to which punishment is due. It expresses an idea as essential to our conception of the Divine righteousness as do the words, "love" and "mercy." Wrath, or indignation, against evil is as necessary to our ideal of a perfect <span class="accented">human</span> being as is love of good; and therefore we attribute wrath to the perfect Divine Being, using of necessity human terms for expressing our conception of the Divine attributes. When the Name of the LORD Was proclaimed before Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>, etc.), it was of One not only "merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth," but also "that will by no means clear the guilty." This last attribute is the same as what we mean by the Divine wrath. This "wrath of God" is said in the verse before us to be "revealed from heaven." How so? Is it in the gospel, as is God's righteousness (ver. 18)? Against this view is the change of expression - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x28;</span> as well as the fact that the gospel is not in itself a revelation of wrath, but the very opposite. Is it in the Old Testament? Possibly in part; but the marked repetition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense seems to point to some obvious revelation <span class="accented">now</span>; and, further, the first part of the proof, to the end of the second chapter, does not rest on the Old Testament. Is it what the apostle proceeds so forcibly to draw attention to - the existing, and at that time notorious, moral degradation of heathen society, which he regards as evidence of Divine judgment? This may have been before his view; and, as he goes on at once to speak of it, it probably was so prominently. But the revelation of Divine wrath against sin seems to imply more than this as the argument goes on, viz. the evident guilt before God of all mankind alike, and not only of degraded heathenism. It is difficult to decide, among the various explanations that have been offered, on any specific mode of revelation which the writer had in view. Perhaps no particular one exclusively. Commentators may be often unduly anxious to affix an exact sense to pregnant words used by St. Paul, who so often indicates comprehensive ideas by short phrases. He may have had before his mind various concurrent signs of human guilt, and the Divine wrath against it, at that especial time of the world's history; all which, to his mind at least, brought conviction as by a light from heaven. And the gospel itself (though in its essence a revelation of mercy, so that he purposely avoids saying that wrath was in it revealed) still had been the most powerful means of all for bringing home a conviction of the Divine wrath to the consciences of believers. For its first office is to convince of sin and of judgment. Cf. the words of the forerunner, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" On all such grounds we may conceive that the apostle spoke of the wrath of God against human sin being especially at that time plainly revealed from heaven; and he desires to bring his readers to perceive it as he did. For now was the time of the Divine purpose to bring it home to all (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent"). "All ungodliness and unrighteousness' (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) comprehends all evil-doing, in whatever aspect viewed, whether as impiety or as wrong. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, "who hold the truth." If the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> allowed this rendering here, it would indeed be intelligible in reference to the knowledge of God, even by nature, which all men have or ought to have, though they do not act upon it, and the very potential possession of which renders them guilty. This is the thought of what immediately follows. Thus the sense would be, "They <span class="accented">hold</span>, i.e. possess, the truth; but they do unrighteousness." But whenever <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to hold," it denotes a firm hold, not a loose hold, such as would be thus implied. It occurs in this sense in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a> ("I praise you that ye <span class="accented">keep</span> the ordinances"). and <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> ("<span class="accented">Hold fast</span> that which is good"). We must, therefore, have recourse to a second sense in which the verb is also used - that of "keeping back," or "restraining." Thus <a href="../../par/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a> ("The people <span class="accented">stayed</span> him, that he should not depart from them") and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a> ("Ye know what <span class="accented">withholdeth"</span>). The reference is still to the innate knowledge of God which all men are supposed to have had originally; but the idea expressed is not their <span class="accented">having</span> it, but their <span class="accented">suppressing</span> it. "Veritas in mente nititur et urget: sed homo eam impedit" (Bengel).

"Paulus directe excusationem adimit, non solum de eventu aliquo loquitur" (Bengel). It is, however, a question of importance, which has been much discussed, whether (as the rendering of the Revised Version might be taken to imply) the idea of Divine <span class="accented">purpose</span>, and [not <span class="accented">result</span> only, is involved in <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The difference between the two conceptions is apparent from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ira at sint inexcusabiles</span>, compared with Calvin's <span class="accented">in hoc ut.</span> The bearing of the distinction on the doctrine of predestination is obvious, and it was consequently a subject of contention between the Lutherans and Calvinists. Meyer among moderns contends strongly that "the view which takes it of the <span class="accented">purpose</span> is required by the prevailing use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with the infinitive," referring in this Epistle to <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 13, 16</a>.

These two verses, 19 and 20, carry out the thought of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 18, their purport being to show that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of men have been in spite of <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, and therefore involve them all in sin. For <span class="accented">sin</span> implies knowledge of good and evil; it is not imputed to the brute beasts, who but follow their natural instincts, having no perception of God or a Divine law. Now, to man, even without any special revelation, God manifests himself in two ways <span class="accented">- outwardly</span> in nature, and <span class="accented">inwardly</span> in conscience. In these verses the outward manifestation is spoken of, the other being more especially noted in ch. 2:14, etc. But here, too, an inward manifestation is implied by the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as before by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. To the animals below us the phenomena of nature may be but a spectacle before their eyes, making no appeal to a mind within. But to man they have a language - they awake wonder, awe, admiration, a sense of infinite mysterious power, and, to the receptive of such impressions, of ideal beauty indefinable. To the psalmists of old they spoke irresistibly of God; of one infinite and eternal Being, above and beyond all; and their consciences, owning the supremacy of good in the moral sphere, concurred with their sense of the evidences of beneficence in nature, so as to convince them also of the <span class="accented">righteousness</span> of God. All men (the apostle would say) were originally endowed with a like capacity of knowing God; and their failure in this regard, shown in the various forms of idolatry prevalent throughout the world, he views as the first stage in the development of human sin. The next stage is general moral degradation, regarded as the judicial consequence of the dishonour done to God. It is, indeed, a necessary consequence; for low and unworthy conceptions of Deity bring with them moral deterioration; when man's Divine ideal becomes degraded, with it he becomes degraded too. Witness, for instance, the debauches and cruelties that so commonly accompanied idolatrous worship. Lastly, the final stage of this moral degradation is represented in an unveiled picture of the utter wickedness, and even unnatural vice, at that time prevalent and condoned in the heart of the boasted civilization of the heathen world. Such is the drift of the remainder of this first chapter. The argument suggests the following thoughts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is no mention here of Adam s transgression as the origin of human sin. The reason is that the apostle is arguing from a philosophical rather than a theological point of view, having Gentile as well as Jewish thinkers in his view as readers. His appeal in this chapter is not to the Old Testament at all, but to facts by all acknowledged. He is offering the world a philosophy of human history to account for the present perplexing state of things - for the undoubted discord between conscience and performance, between ideal and practice, - his purpose being to show universal guilt on the part of man. But his position here is quite consistent with what he says elsewhere (as in ch. 5.) of Adam's original transgression. For his whole argument in this chapter involves the doctrine of the <span class="accented">fall</span> of man, who is conceived to have been originally endowed with Divine instincts, and to have forfeited his prerogative through sin; and this is the essential meaning of the picture given us in <a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. of the original transgression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The entire drift of the chapter is against the view of the condemnation of mankind being due simply to the sin of the progenitor being <span class="accented">imputed to</span> the race. For all men are represented as guilty, in that all have sinned against light which they might have followed. This view does not, indeed, preclude that of an inherited infection of nature predisposing all to sin; nay, it rather necessitates it; for why should the sin have been so universal but for such predisposing cause? Still, the distinction between the two views is important in regard to our conception of the Divine justice. 3. It may, however, be said that the distinction is without a real difference in this regard; for that, if the inherited infection is such that sin becomes inevitable (as seems to be implied by its alleged universality), it may appear as inconsistent with the Divine justice to condemn men for it, as it would be to impute to them their progenitor's transgression. In reply to this difficulty, it may be said that Scripture nowhere says that men are <span class="accented">finally</span> condemned for it. On the contrary, the gospel reveals to us the atonement, preordained from the first, for the avoidance of such final condemnation; and this retrospective as well as prospective in its effects (<a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>), and as far-reaching as was the original transgression (<a href="../../par/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>, etc.). And our apostle (<a href="../../par/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7, 14, 15, 16</a>) expressly asserts the salvation of <span class="accented">all</span> who, according to their light, have done what they could. The fact is, that in the argument before us (as in other passages of similar purport) it is only the <span class="accented">principle</span>, or the <span class="accented">ground</span>, of man's possible justification before God that is under review. The intention is to show that this cannot be man's own "works or deservings," as of debt, but is another which the gospel reveals. Be it observed, lastly, that a clear view of this position is important, not only for our apprehension of the truth of things and of the meaning of the gospel, but also for our right moral tone of mind and attitude before God. For not to be convinced of sin is to belie the true ideal of our conscience, and implies acquiescence in a moral standard below that of the Divine righteousness to which we are able to aspire.

It implies actual knowledge, not mere capacity of knowledge. Mankind is regarded as having lost a truer perception of God once possessed, idolatry being a sign of culpable degradation of the human race - not, as some would have us now believe, a stage in man's emergence from brutality. Scripture ever represents the human race as having fallen and become degraded; not as having risen gradually to any intelligent conceptions of God at all. And it may well be asked whether modern anthropological science has really discovered anything to discredit the scriptural view of the original condition and capacity of man. The view here presented is that obfuscation of the understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) ensued from refusal to <span class="accented">glorify</span> and <span class="accented">give thanks to</span> known Deity.

Two forms of idolatry - both involving unworthy conceptions of the Divine Being - are alluded to, suggested, we may suppose, by the anthropomorphism of the Greeks and the creature-worship of Egypt, which were the two notable and representative developments of heathen religion.

But this is not so. The degradation spoken of was long anterior to them, nor is this charge, as formulated, applicable to them. The idea is, generally, that boasted human intellect has not preserved men from folly; not even "the wisdom of the Egyptians," or the intellectual culture of the Greeks (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 3:19, etc.).

The verb, however, is probably passive, a middle use of it not being elsewhere found. In either ease the general meaning is the same. The genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seems most naturally taken as denoting what the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> consisted in, rather than either the <span class="accented">purpose</span> or the <span class="accented">results</span> of their being given over to it (cf. ver. 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is followed by a description of what these were).

It is notorious that idolatrous worship was not uncommonly accompanied by debauchery; notably that of the Phoenician Astarte, and of Aphrodite and Dionysus (see Livy, 39:8, for an account of the Dionysus at one time in Rome; and Athen., 13. pp. 574, 579, and 14. p. 659, for the Aphrodisia at Athens and Corinth); cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, etc., "The people joined themselves unto Baal-peor," and the allusion to it, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>. On that occasion no more is intimated than promiscuous intercourse between the two sexes, sinking men in that regard to the level of the brutes; but still worse "uncleanness" is in the apostle's view, such as sinks them even below that level; and how common such unnatural vices had become, and how lightly thought of, no one conversant with classical literature needs to be reminded.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is capable of the senses <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "to prove" (as in assaying metals), and, generally, "to discern," or "judge;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to approve," after supposed proving. Jowett, in his commentary on this Epistle, endeavours to retain in English the correspondence between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> by translating, "As they did not <span class="accented">discern</span> to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an <span class="accented">undiscerning</span> mind," thus taking the verb in sense (1), and the adjective in the same sense actively. But it is at least doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> can be taken in an active sense, which is not its classical one. In the New Testament it occurs <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>. In the first of the above passages the word obviously means "rejected" (in the Authorized Version <span class="accented">a castaway</span>), with reference to the comparison of a competitor in athletic contests being proved unworthy of the prize - a sense cognate to the common one of the same adjective as applied to spurious metals, rejected or worthless after being tested. In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>, either sense seems admissible - <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But not so in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>, where the word is applied to barren land. The passages from 2 Timothy and Titus may in themselves admit the sense of <span class="accented">undiscerning</span>, but the passive one is more probable in view of the common usage of the word. On the other hand, ch. 12:2 may be adduced in favour of the active sense; for there the consequence of the renewal of the mind in Christians is said to be that they may <span class="accented">prove</span>, or <span class="accented">discern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), what is Gods will; and hence it may seem probable that the want of such <span class="accented">discernment is</span> denoted here. The same passage also favours the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being taken here in sense (1) given above, and Jowett's rendering of the whole passage.

In this concluding verse the main point of the whole argument, with which also it began (ver. 19), is repeated, viz. that all this sin was in spite of better knowledge - the original knowledge of God revealed, as above set forth, to the human race, and (as is implied further) an inward witness of conscience still remaining, however stifled, even in the most corrupt society. By <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is not meant "deserving of capital punishment;" Divine judgment is evidently implied. There is no need to inquire what conception of future retribution the heathen themselves may be supposed to have had, or to have been capable of entertaining. St. Paul constantly denotes by <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in a general and comprehensive sense, the penal consequence of unatoned sin due to the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6</a>, etc.). It is to be observed that in the latter part of this verse the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning habitual <span class="accented">practice</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is not shown in the Authorized Version. The evidence of the "reprobate mind" is not simply that such things are done occasionally under temptation, but that they are the habits of people's lives. And still more: such habits are not only participated in by those who have knowledge enough to perceive their guilt (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), but even condoned and approved (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); there was no general protest or indignation in society against the prevalent abominations; and those familiar with the writers of the Augustan age must be well aware that this was so. Here we have the final proof of the prevalence of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, the climax of the picture of general moral degradation.

The position to be proved is that all mankind is guilty before God (see note on ver. 18). So far this has been shown with regard to the mass of the heathen world; its general moral corruption, prevalent and condoned, having been pointed out finally as a glaring proof; the main point of the argument having been to trace this state of things to man's own fault, in that he had refused to retain and act on a knowledge of God originally imparted to him through nature and through conscience. From such refusal had ensued idolatry; thence, as a judicial consequence, profligacy; thence a general prevalence of abominable practices; and at last (in many at least) the "reprobate mind," lost to moral restraint, and approving of vice as well as practising it. Thus it is sufficiently proved that the heathen world, regarded as a whole, is under sin, and liable to the wrath of God. But the required proof that the whole of mankind is guilty is not yet complete. It might be said that there are many still who disapprove of all this wickedness, and sit in judgment on it, and who are, therefore, not themselves implicated in the guilt. To such persons the apostle now turns, his purpose being to show that their judging others does not exempt themselves, unless they can show that they are themselves sinless. All, he argues, are tainted with sin, and therefore implicated in the guilt of the human race, while the very fact of their judging others condemns them all the more. It is usually said by commentators that, the sin of the heathen world having been established in the first chapter, the second has reference exclusively to the Jews. But this is surely not so. The expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (vers. 1, 3), seem evidently to include <span class="accented">all</span> who judge others; and it is not till ver. 9 that any distinction between Jew and Gentile comes in. Nor would the argument have been complete without refutation of Gentile as well as Jewish judgers of others. For the philosophical schools especially claimed superiority to the mass of mankind, and would be likely to resent their own inclusion in the general condemnation. Notably the Stoics, whose philosophy was at that time, as well as that of the Epicureans, extensively professed by educated Romans. Seneca was a contemporary of St. Paul. The Stoics might be suitably designated as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: for they affected to look down from a position of calm philosophical superiority on those who followed their mere natural impulses, professing to be themselves guided by right reason, and superior to the passions of ordinary humanity. It was a home-thrust at them to ask - Are you, who thus judge others, as exempt as you profess to be from the vices you condemn? If the accounts that have come down to us of Seneca's own life be true, he certainly was not a paragon of virtue. Now, be it observed that the sort of people now addressed are not concluded to be sunk into all the depths of sin spoken of above; their very affecting to judge others implies, at any rate, theoretic approval of the right. Nor does St. Paul anywhere suggest that there is no difference between man and man with regard to moral worth before God; nay, in this very chapter he forcibly declares the moral excellence of some, without the Law as well as with the Law, and eternal life as its reward (vers. 7, 10, 14, 15). All he implies of necessity is that none whatever are so exempt from sin as to be in a position to judge others; and it is the judgment of others that he here especially attacks, as increasing, rather than exempting from, condemnation. For it involves in itself the sin of presumption, unless those that judge are sinless. But it may be said that the universal sinfulness of mankind is still not proved. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is not actually demonstrated that all of those who judge "do the same things." The answer to this objection is, that this does not admit of rigid proof, and that therefore the apostle deems it enough to appeal to the consciences of the judgers themselves as to how the matter stands with them. But it may be said <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the sinfulness of such persons as are spoken of in vers. 7, 10, 14, 15, 29-such, namely, as sincerely strive after good without setting themselves up as judges - is still unproved. So it is in this chapter; and, for logical completeness, the proof must be taken as implied. It was, we may suppose in the writer's mind, and afterwards, in ch. 7, where the inner consciousness of even the best is analyzed, the missing link of the argument is supplied. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest</span> (rather, <span class="accented">dost practise</span>; the word is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see <a href="../../par/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the same things. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit</span> (or, <span class="accented">practise</span>, as before) <span class="cmt_word">such things</span>. As has been observed above, the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "does the same things," is not proved; it is incapable of patent proof, and so the argument takes the form of an appeal to the consciences of such persons. "Porro quia ipsos interioris impuritatis insimulat, quae ut humanos oculos latet, redargui convincique nequeat humanis testimoniis, ad Dei judicium provocat, cui nec tenebrae ipsae sunt absconditae, et cujus sensu tangi peceatoribus, velint nolint, necesse est" (Calvin).

It may be here observed again that it is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> against whom these indignant denunciations are hurled, and this on the very ground of his thus setting himself up to judge while being himself guilty. Of him it is implied, not only that he shares the guilt of mankind, but also that he especially will not <span class="accented">escape</span> the final judgment. Of others who, conscious of their own failings, seek sincerely alter good, this is not said, however liable to condemnation on their own mere merits they may be. Indeed, the contrary is emphatically asserted in the verses that follow; nay, even eternal life is assured to such, whoever they may be, and under whatever dispensation, though it does not fall within the scope of the argument to explain in this place why or how. It is important for us to see this clearly for an understanding of the drift of the chapter, and of St. Paul's whole doctrine with respect to human sin and its consequences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will render to every man according to his works</span>. This assertion is no contradiction of the main portion of the Epistle as it proceeds, as to justification being not of works; the phrase here being, not on <span class="accented">account of</span> his works, but <span class="accented">according</span> to them. "Nequaquam tamen quid valeant, sed quid illis debeatur pretii pronunciat" (Calvin). The <span class="accented">ground</span> of justification is not here involved. All that is asserted is what is essential to any true conception of God's justice, viz. that he has regard to <span class="accented">what men are</span> in assigning reward or punishment; it is what is given in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> as a first principle of faith about God, "that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him." It is further evident from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, and still more from all that follows, that all such will be so rewarded, whether before Christ or after his coming, whether knowing him or not knowing him. Nor is the inclusion of the latter inconsistent with the doctrine that salvation is through Christ alone. For the effect of his atonement is represented as retrospective as well as prospective, and as availing virtually for all mankind (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15, 18, 20</a>). Hence the narrow doctrine of some divines, who would confine the possibility of salvation to those who have had in some way during life a conscious faith in the atonement, is evidently not the doctrine of St. Paul.

So, too, the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui sunt ex contentione</span>; and similarly Origen, Chrysostom, OEcumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, etc. This, however, is not the classical sense of the word, which is not connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("strife"), but with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which means originally a day labourer, or a worker for hire, being so used in Homer. Hence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> meant <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> labour for wages, and came to mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> canvassing or intriguing for office, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> faction, or party-spirit (cf. Arist., 'Pol.,' 5. 2, 6; 3, 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notwithstanding the weight of ancient authority for its bearing the sense of "contention" in the New Testament, that of "faction" seems more likely and suitable in the passages where it occurs; and certainly so here, the idea seeming to be that the persons spoken of <span class="accented">factiously</span> renounced their allegiance to "the truth," obeying <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> instead. We observe how expressions are here heaped up, significant of the Divine indignation against high-handed sin, unrepented and unatoned for, of which the apostle, in very virtue of his view of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, had an awful sense (see above on Romans 1:18; and cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, etc.; and also <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Still, neither this verse nor ver. 5 is of necessity inconsistent with other well-known passages, where St. Paul seems to contemplate God's reconciliation in the end of <span class="accented">all things</span> to himself in Christ (see <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The "indignation and wrath" spoken of in the passages before us (being, as was said under Romans 1:18, inseparable from a full conception of the eternal righteousness) may still be conceived as having a corrective as well as a punitive purpose. Nor is the doctrine which has been called that of "eternal hope" of necessity precluded by statements which imply no more than that sin, unrepented and unatoned for, must inevitably undergo its doom in the unknown regions of <span class="accented">eternity.</span> The thought, at the end of ver. 9, for the first time passes distinctly to the <span class="accented">Jew's</span> assumed exemption from the condemnation of the rest of mankind; and to this exclusively the remainder of the chapter is devoted. The "indignation," etc., it is said, will be upon the <span class="accented">Jew first</span> (cf. ch. 1:16), which may mean either <span class="accented">in the first instance</span>, or <span class="accented">principally.</span> His priority in Divine favor involves priority in retribution, while his pre-eminence in privilege carries with it corresponding responsibility (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>; also <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>-8 and <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). Then in ver. 10 a like priority is assigned to the Jew with respect to reward, the general assertion of ver. 7 being repeated (with some differ-once of expression) in order to complete the view of his prior position in both respects. For the covenant was with the Jews; the promises were to them: the Gentiles were as the wild olive tree, grafted in, and made partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree (<a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).

This, with what follows, is important, as bringing out in a striking way the clear doctrine of the New Testament that the Jews had no monopoly of Divine favour with respect to final salvation. Whatever advantages certain races of mankind seem undoubtedly to have above others in this world (and that this has been, and is so, with other races as well as the Jews is obvious), all men are described as standing on an exactly equal footing at the bar of eternal equity.

It has, therefore, been rendered above simply as Law, not as either <span class="accented">the law</span>, or <span class="accented">a law</span>, as the same word will be below, whenever it stands by itself without either the article or any modifying genitive. Much has been written by commentators on the senses in which this word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is to be understood, as used by St. Paul with or without the article. In an Appendix to the Introduction to the Epistle to the Romans in the 'Speaker's Commentary' will be found a summary of the views taken by critics of repute, with exhaustive references to the usage of the word in the Septuagint, in the New Testament generally, and in the writings of St. Paul. It has not been thought necessary in this Commentary to discuss further what has been so amply discussed already. It may suffice to state certain principles for the reader's guidance, which appear plainly to commend themselves to acceptance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, with the article prefixed, always means the Mosaic Law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, without the article, may have, and often has, specific reference to the Mosaic Law; but, if so, the emission of the article is not arbitrary, but involves a difference of meaning. The article in Greek is prefixed to a word when the latter is intended to convey some definite idea already familiarized to the mind, and "the natural effect of its presence is to divert the thoughts from dwelling on the peculiar import of the word, and is adverse to its inherent notion standing out as a prominent point in the sense of the passage" (quoted from 'Grammar of the New Testament Dialect,' by T. S. Green, in Appendix to Introduction to Romans in the 'Speaker's Commentary '). Hence the omission of the article, where it might have been used, before a word has often the effect of emphasizing and drawing attention to the <span class="accented">inherent notion</span> of the word. We may take as an instance ver. 17 in this chapter, where the Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> but where the preferable reading omits the article. In either case the Mosaic Law is referred to; but the omission of the article brings into prominence the <span class="accented">principle</span> of justification on which the Jew rested - viz. <span class="accented">Law</span>, which exacts entire obedience. In the following verse (the eighteenth), in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> the  article is inserted, the intention being simply to say that the Jew was instructed in the well-known Law of Moses. The same difference of meaning is intimated by the omission or insertion of the article in ver. 23 and elsewhere in other parts of the chapter and of the whole Epistle (see especially ch. 7.). The apostle, who, however spontaneous and unstudied might be his style of writing, by no means used phrases at random, would not surely have thus varied his expressions so often in one and the same sentence without intended significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> without the article seems evidently in many passages to be used by St. Paul to denote law in the abstract, without any exclusive reference to the Mosaic Law at all, or to any particular code of law. Doubtless the Mosaic Law, in which he had been educated, and which he had painfully proved the impossibility of keeping perfectly, had been to him the grand embodiment and representative of law; but he had hence been led to an abstract conception, ever before his mind, of law as representing the principle of exaction of full obedience to requirements; and when he says, as he so often does, that by law no man can be justified, he means that none can be so on the principle of complete conformity being required to the behests of Divine righteousness, whether as revealed from Mount Sinai or through the human conscience, or in any other way; for by law is the knowledge of sin and consequent guilt, but not the power of avoiding sin. Those who ignore the distinction as above explained, saying, as some do, that <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whether with or without the article, always means simply the Law of Moses, fail to enter into the depth and generality of the apostle's argument. The distinction will be observed in this translation throughout the Epistle (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being translated "the Law," and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "law"), and it will be found always to have a meaning. (For one instance in which it is hardly possible to suppose St. Paul to have omitted and inserted the article in the same sentence without a meaning, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a>.)

The "for" at the beginning of ver. 14 connects it with the preceding one thus: "Not <span class="accented">hearers</span> but <span class="accented">doers</span> of law will be justified." The Jew, therefore, has no advantage in the way of justification over the Gentile from being in a peculiar sense a <span class="accented">hearer. For</span> Gentiles also may be <span class="accented">doers</span>, though not of a positive revealed law, yet of the law of conscience. It is not, of course, implied that on the <span class="accented">ground</span> of any such <span class="accented">doing</span> they "shall be justified;" only that, so far as they <span class="accented">do</span>, they will, equally with the Jews, be rewarded. Nor is it said that any, in fact, do <span class="accented">all</span> that law enjoins. We observe the hypothetical form of expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;</span>, and also, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any of the Law's requirements. The Law, for instance, says, "Thou shalt not steal;" and if a Gentile, though knowing nothing of the ten commandments, on principle refrains from stealing, his conscientious honesty will have its own reward as much as that of the Jew who refrains in obedience to the revealed commandment. A few of the expressions in these verses call for consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, said to be "written in their hearts"? <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> cannot be pleonastic, as supposed by Tholuck.

The objection to this view is that it is not the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Law that can be said to be <span class="accented">written</span>, but rather the Law itself from which the works proceed. Seeing that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> implies evident reference to the tables of the Law, it seems best to take <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as denoting the <span class="accented">efficacy</span> of the Law, as opposed to the <span class="accented">letter</span>, which alone was written on the tables.

The very possibility of their doing this is evidence of an innate moral sense in the human heart, which, however it may often be obscured or perverted, remains as a characteristic of humanity, and is more or less operative in all communities. "Nulls enim gens unquam sic ab humanitate abhorruit ut non se intra leges aliquas contineret. Constat absque dubio quasdam justitiae et rectitudinis conceptiones, quas Graeci <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> recant, hominum animis esse naturaliter ingenitas" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> What is exactly meant by the <span class="accented">conscience</span> witnessing, and the <span class="accented">thoughts</span> accusing or else excusing? <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is not the Law in the heart, but rather our <span class="accented">consciousness</span>, whereby wittingly, in accordance with that Law, we approve or condemn. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote a <span class="accented">joint</span> witness of conscience. In <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a> and Romans 9:1, where alone the word occurs elsewhere, it is followed by a dative, and means certainly <span class="accented">concurrent</span> witness. But, if so here, with what? Probably with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> already spoken cf. Right conduct on principle, and conscience approving, witness together to the inward law; or, conduct and conscience together witness to a man's merits or demerits in accordance with that law. Then, what is added about the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> shows how conscience operates. Reason comes into play, evoked by conscience, to reflect on its witness, and definitely condemn or approve what has been done. A kind of court of judicature is supposed. Man calls himself to the bar of his own moral judgment; his conscience adduces witness to the character of his deeds, or rather, with his deeds bears witness for or against himself; his thoughts are as advocates on both sides, arguing for condemnation or acquittal. "Observa quam erudite describat conscientiam, quum dicit nobis venire in mentem rationes, quibus quod recte factum est defendimus; rursum quae nos flagitiorum accusent et redarguant" (Calvin).

About this verse the main question is, what previous assertion the "when" refers to. The time denoted by "when" (whether we suppose <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the present or future tense - to have been intended by the writer) is certainly the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, and ether passages - the day of doom, when "every man's <span class="accented">work</span> shall be made manifest." Hence immediate connection of this verse with the preceding one, which would otherwise have been the natural one, seems to be precluded; for in ver. 15 the present operation of conscience, during this present life, was described. One way of making the connection obvious is by understanding ver. 15 as itself denoting the manifestation reserved for the day of judgment, when all will stand self-convicted. But not only the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense, but also the fact of the whole verse being so obvious a description of present human consciousness, seems to preclude this view. Some would connect ver. 16 with ver. 12, of which it is in itself a natural sequence; and this connection is intimated in the Authorized Version, which includes the three verses that come between in a parenthesis. The objection to it is the length of the parenthesis. Probably the apostle, in his characteristic way, paid little regard to precise logical sequence; he only desired to express, in this concluding verse, that in the great day full justice would be done, and all that he had been speaking of would be made plain. <span class="accented">My gospel</span> means "the gospel committed unto me to preach" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). The idea that it means "the Gospel according to St. Luke," said to have been written under St. Paul's superintendence, is too improbable to call for serious notice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if</span> (the true reading being certainly <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, as in the Textus Receptus) <span class="cmt_word">thou</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">art named a Jew</span>.

They are so called, whether resident in Palestine or elsewhere, throughout the New Testament, as well as by Roman writers. the term <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being applied in the New Testament (usually at least) to distinguish those Jews who adhered to the Hebrew language in public worship, and to national customs and traditions, from those who <span class="accented">Hellenized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). It was the name on which the people prided themselves at that time, as expressing their peculiar privileges. The apostle, having at the beginning of this chapter addressed himself generally to "whosoever thou art that judgest," now summons the Jew exclusively to the bar of judgment, whose claims to exemption from the general condemnation have come to the front in the preceding verses. By the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, he calls on him now to give an account of himself, and justify his pretensions if he can. The point of the argument is that the Jews were notoriously at that time no better than other nations in moral conduct - nay, their national character was such as to bring their very religion into disrepute among the heathen - and therefore <span class="accented">doing</span>, and not either privilege, knowledge, or profession, being according to the very <span class="accented">Law</span> on which they rested the test required, their whole ground for national exemption was taken away. <span class="cmt_word">And retest on law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, here without the article, so as to emphasize the <span class="accented">principle</span> on which the Jew professed to rest for acceptance), <span class="cmt_word">and makest thy boast of God</span>. The Jew gloried, as against the heathen, in his knowledge and worship of the one true God.

So far the Jew's own claims on the ground of his own position have been touched on; what follows expresses his attitude with regard to others. We may observe throughout a vein of irony.

In what follows it is not, of course, implied that all Jews who relied on the Law were, in fact, thieves, adulterers, etc., but only that the Jews as a nation were no more exempt from such sins than others; and it may be that those specified were not selected by the apostle at random, but as being such as the Jews had a peculiar evil notoriety for at that time.

Commentators differ as to what is meant. Some, considering that the word would not have been used except to denote something really sacrilegious - some offence against true sanctity - refer it to the withholding of gifts and offerings from the temple at Jerusalem, or of tithes from the priests, or embezzlement of the temple revenues. <a href="../../par/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>, etc., is adduced in illustration, "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings," etc. (cf. also <a href="../../par/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7-14</a>). A passage also is quoted from Josephus, 'Archaeol.,' B. 18, c. 5, where certain Jews are said to have appropriated to their own use purple and gold which had been given to them for the temple at Jerusalem by one Fulvia, a proselyte of theirs at Rome, in consequence of which the Emperor Tiberius, having been informed of the transaction by the lady's husband, had banished all the Jews from Rome. Others take the word in a general sense to denote any profanation of sanctity. So Luther, Calvin ("profanatio divinae majestatis"), and Bengel ("sacrilegium committi's, quia Deo non das gloriam, quae proprie Dei est"). Inasmuch, however, as definite malpractices of the Jews at that time, on account of which the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles (ver. 24), seem to be here alluded to, the word may, perhaps more probably, be understood in its proper sense of <span class="accented">plundering temples</span>, meaning heathen temples - a practice which Jewish zealots, in their professed abhorrence of idolatry, might be addicted to when they had opportunity. A writer, though himself attaching no idea of sanctity to such temples, might still use the current term <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. SO, among the ancients, Chrysostom and Theophylact understand it; the latter, however, limiting it to taking away the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> He says, "For if they did abhor the idols, yet nevertheless, dominated by covetousness, they touched the idol-offerings for filthy lucre's sake." In doing this, he seems to imply, they broke the very Law which had enjoined their ancestors to "destroy the altars, and break down the images" of idolaters (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>); for the sauna Law had forbidden them to "desire the silver and gold that is on them," or "take it unto thee, for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). A strong confirmation of the view that plundering of heathen temples is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="../../par/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>, when the town-clerk of Ephesus defended the Christians against the popular fury by declaring that they were not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, that is (as he might mean) not temple-plunderers, such as ordinary Jews had the reputation of being. It has been objected against this view that there is a lack of recorded instances of such temple-plundering on the part of Jews, and that they could not have had much chance, as things then were, of thus displaying their zeal. But there may have been instances, notorious at the time, though not recorded; and, if so, the drift may be, "Thou displayest thy abhorrence of idolatry, enjoined by the Law, by acts of violence and greed, such as the very Law forbids."

The passage is not quoted as a prophecy now fulfilled, or as in its original reference exactly applicable, but only as serving to express well how the character of the Jews had brought their very religion into disrepute (el. Tacitus, 'Hist..' 5:4, etc.). The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a clear and final exposition of the principle, involved throughout all the previous verses, that Jewish privileges were of no profit in themselves, or without their meaning and purpose being understood and acted on. The thought now passes exclusively to circumcision, as being the original token of the covenant, and the Jew's rite of initiation into his whole privileged position (<a href="../../par/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>.). When <span class="accented">Jew</span> had come to be the peculiar designation of the children of the covenant, persons were said to become <span class="accented">Jews</span> by circumcision. Thus <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the people of the land became Jews," where the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may be here observed that the known fact of other races as well as the Jews having practised, and still practising, circumcision is not subversive of the scriptural view of its being a peculiarly Jewish rite. For to the Jew alone it had a peculiar significance.

Some difficulty in determining his exact meaning arises from the concise and pregnant form in which the objections are put and answered, and from fresh ones arising out of the answers, which have also to be met. The objections are from the Jewish standpoint, though not put into the mouth of an objecting Jew, but rather suggested as likely ones by St. Paul himself. To the original readers of the Epistle, who were familiar with the tone of Jewish thought, the sequence of the ideas would probably be more obvious than to us. Reserving special consideration of successive clauses for our exposition of each verse, we may, in the first place, exhibit thus the general drift. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 1 (ver. 1). If being a Jew, if circumcision itself, gives one no advantage over the Gentile, what was the use of the old covenant at all? It is thus shown to have been illusory; and God's own truth and faithfulness are impugned, if he is supposed to have given, as conveying advantages, what really conveyed none. (This last thought, though not expressed, must be supposed to be implied in the objection, since it is replied to in the answer.) <span class="accented">Answer</span> (vers. 2-4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was not illusory; it did convey great advantages in the way of <span class="accented">privilege and opportunity</span>; this advantage first, not to mention other. that "the oracles of God" were entrusted to the Jew. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some (more or fewer, it matters not) have failed to realize these advantages, it has been their fault, not God's. It is man's unfaithfulness, not his, that has been the cause of the failure. Nay, though, according to the hasty saying of the psalmist, <span class="accented">all men</span> were false, God's truth remains; nay, further, as is expressed in another psalm (<a href="../../par/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.), man's very unfaithfulness is found to commend his faithfulness the more, and redound to his greater glory. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 2 (ver. 5). Based on the last assertion. But if man's unfaithfulness has this result, how can God, consistently with his justice, be wrath with us and punish us for it? Surely the Jew (whose case we are now considering) may claim exemption from "the wrath" of God spoken of above, his unfaithfulness being allowed to have served only to establish God's truth and to enhance his glory. <span class="accented">Answer</span> (ver. 6-8). I have suggested this objection as though the matter could be regarded from a mere human point of view, as though it were one between man and man; for it is true that a man cannot justly take vengeance on another who has not really harmed him. But such a view is inapplicable to God in his dealings with man; it does not touch our doctrine of his righteous wrath against sin as such. I can only meet it with a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it would preclude God from judging the world at all, as we all believe he will do. Any <span class="accented">heathen</span> sinner might put in the same plea, saying, Why am I too (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) judged as a sinner? Nay, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> since it involves the principle of sin being evil, not in itself, but only with regard to its consequences, it would, if carried out, justify the odious view (which we Christians are by some falsely accused of holding) that we may do evil that good may come. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What advantage then hath the Jew! or what is the profit of circumcision! Much</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;</span>, a neuter adjective, agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">every way</span> (not <span class="accented">by all means</span>; the meaning is that in all respects the position of the Jew is an advantageous one): <span class="cmt_word">first</span> (rather than <span class="accented">chiefly</span>, as in the Authorized Version. One point of advantage is specified, which might have been followed by a <span class="accented">secondly</span> and a <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, etc. But the writer stops here, the mention of this <span class="accented">first</span> being sufficient for his purpose. Others are enumerated, so as to elucidate the purport of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in ch. 9:4, 5) <span class="cmt_word">for that they</span> (the Jews) <span class="cmt_word">were entrusted with the oracles of God</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (always used in the plural in the New Testament) occurs also in <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>. Of these passages the most apposite is <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>, where the Divine communications to Moses on Mount Sinai are spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16</a>, where Balaam speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Some (as Meyer), in view of the supposed, reference in the following verse to the Jews rejection of the gospel, take the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> here to mean especially the revealed promises of the Redeemer. But neither the word itself nor its use elsewhere suggests any such limited meaning; nor does the context really require it. It may denote generally the Divine revelations of the Old Testament, which, for the eventual benefit of mankind, had been entrusted exclusively to the Jews.

The expression does net denote whether many or few; it only avoids assertion of universality of unbelief (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7</a>), though it is implied in the following verso that, even if it had been universal, the argument would stand) <span class="cmt_word">did not believe?</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span> Alford renders <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> "were unfaithful," taking it in the sense of being "unfaithful to the covenant, the very condition of which was to walk in the ways of the Lord, and observe his statutes;" and this on the ground that the apostle is not as yet speaking of faith or the want of it, but, in accordance with the idea of the preceding chapter, of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 5) and moral guilt. But the meaning of words must not be forced to meet the views of interpreters; and we observe that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are ever elsewhere used in their proper sense to denote want of <span class="accented">faith</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11, 14, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>, 41; <a href="../../par/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>). Still, it is to be observed that in the passage before us <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in man is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in God, so as to suggest a more general sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than mere <span class="accented">unbelief.</span> In view of this opposition, we may adopt the rendering of the whole passage in the Revised Version: "What if some were without faith? Shall their want of faith," etc.? Meyer and others, understanding (as said above) by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> the Divine oracles which were prophetic of Christ, refer <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> exclusively to the disbelief in him on the part of the majority of the Jews at the time of writing. But the aorist tense of the verb, as well as the context, is against the idea of such reference, at any rate exclusively. The context, both in ch. 2. and the latter part of this chapter after ver. 9, certainly suggests rather reference to the failure of the Jews throughout their history to realize the advantage of their privileged position; and this failure might properly be attributed to their want of faith, to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>, together with <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in these passages is regarded as the root of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. On the other hand, the whole drift of ch. 11. in this Epistle - where the <span class="accented">present</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen people shown in their rejection of the gospel is spoken of as not hindering, but furthering, the righteous purpose of God, and redounding in the end to his glory - suggests a like reference here. And it may have been in the apostle's mind, though, for the reasons above given, it can hardly be the only one in the passage before us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (there is no better English phrase for expressing the indignant repudiation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">yea, let God be true</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his truth be established;" "Fiat, in judicio," Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged</span>, We can hardly avoid recognizing a reference to <a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> in "every man a liar, the words of the LXX. being exactly given, though the general purport of that psalm does not bear upon the present argument. The apostle takes this phrase from it as expressing well what he wants to say, viz. that though <span class="accented">all</span> men were false (in the sense expressed and implied by the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), yet God's truth stands. But it only leads up to the second quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, which is the important one, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In its final words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, the LXX. is followed (so also Vulgate, <span class="accented">cum</span> <span class="accented">judicaris</span>), though the Hebrew may be more correctly rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "be clear when thou judgest." The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX. may be understood passively in the sense of God being called to account, as men might be, for the justice of his dealings; or, perhaps, in a middle sense for entering into a suit or controversy with his people. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "going to law" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1, 6</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>), and in the LXX., with especial reference to a supposed <span class="accented">controversy</span> or <span class="accented">pleading</span> of God with men, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>.

The meaning of this concluding expression does not, however, affect the main purport of the verse, or its relevancy as here quoted. Occurring in what is believed to be David's penitential psalm after his sin. in the matter of Uriah, it declares, in conjunction with the preceding verse, that, sin having been committed, man alone is guilty, and that God's truth and righteousness can never be impugned. But it seems to imply still more than this, viz. that man's sin has the establishment of God's righteousness as its consequence, or even, it may be, as its purpose; for the conclusion of ver. 4 in the psalm, naturally connected with "against thee only have I sinned" preceding, is so connected by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> (in Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>); and it is not out of keeping with scriptural doctrine that David should have intended to express even Divine <span class="accented">purpose in</span> that he had been permitted, for his sins, to fall into that deeper sin <span class="accented">with the view of</span> establishing God's righteousness all the more. It does not, however, seem certain (whatever some grammarians may say) that the conjunction need of necessity be understood as <span class="accented">relic</span>; it may be <span class="accented">embatic</span> only. However this be, it is the inference from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;</span> that suggests the new objection of the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i>Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?

For there is nothing in the context to suggest the Gentiles as the speakers, nor does what follow suit the supposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The main question is as to the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, and has, therefore, to be interpreted from consideration of the sense of which the verb is capable, and the probable drift of the argument. Some have taken it as a passive verb, with the meaning, "Are we surpassed?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are we Jews in <span class="accented">worse</span> case than the Gentiles on account of our greater privileges? The active verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of "to excel," being both transitive and intransitive, its passive may be used in the same sense. An instance quoted in commentaries is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Plut., 'Mor.,'), "cum Jove minores non sint." So the recent Revisers, though dissented from by the American Committee. The strong objection to this interpretation is that there has been nothing so far even to suggest any <span class="accented">superiority</span> of the Gentile to the Jew, and that what follows does not bear upon any such idea. Thus to interpret would be to sacrifice the sense to supposed grammatical exigence, which, after all, is uncertain. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as the middle voice, we have two interpretations before us; either, with Meyer, to render, <span class="accented">Do we put forward</span> (anything) <span class="accented">in our defence? - which</span> he maintains (though not conclusively) to be the only proper sense of the middle verb - or (as in the Authorized Version), <span class="accented">Are we</span> better (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in better ease) <span class="accented">than they?</span> This rendering, though it gives essentially the same sense as if <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (intransitive) had been written, is commended by its suitableness to the course of argument, and the middle voice may, perhaps, he accounted for as denoting the Jews' supposed claim of superiority for themselves. Thus the connection of thought is plain. The conclusion of ch. 2. had left the Jews on the same footing with the Gentiles before God in respect of sinfulness. But then objections had been raised on the ground of the acknowledged privileges of the chosen people; and such objections have been met. The apostle now sums up the result: What, then, is the state of the case? Have we any advantage to allege? No, not at all in the sense intended; the previous argument stands; and he proceeds to confine his position from the testimony of the Old Testament itself.

These texts are from various unconnected passages of the Old Testament, quoted from the LXX., though not all accurately. They seem to be put together from memory by way of showing the general scriptural view of human depravity. It may be said that they do not establish the apostle's position of <span class="accented">all</span> men being guilty; for that they are for the most part rhetorical rather than dogmatic, that most of them refer only to certain classes of men, and that the righteous are spoken of too, and this in the sequence of even the most sweeping of them all (that from <a href="../../par/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. or Psalms 53.), which does, literally understood, assert universal sinfulness. Any such objection to the cogency of the quotations may be met by regarding them as adduced, not as rigid proofs, but as only generally confirmatory of the apostle's position. See, he would say to the Jew, the picture your own Scriptures give you; observe their continued testimony to human depravity: and the main point of all the quotations is that which is brought out in the next verse, viz. that they had reference, not to the Gentile world, but to the chosen people themselves.

In this concluding verse the apostle briefly intimates the reason of law's inefficacy for justification, anticipating, after a manner usual with him, what is afterwards to be more fully set forth, as especially in ch. 7. The reason is that law in itself only defines sin and makes it sinful, but does not emancipate from it.

On the essential meaning of <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), see on Romans 1:17, and Introduction. This passage, in which the thesis of <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> is formally enunciated, is consistent with this meaning; in confirmation of which observe vers. 25, 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently means God's own righteousness, as also above, ver. 5. If this view is correct, there is no need to follow commentators into their discussions of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in supposed connection with the idea of man's <span class="accented">imputed</span> righteousness; such as whether it is meant to declare justification through Christ to be <span class="accented">without the aid</span> of the Law - "sine legis adminiculo" (Calvin) - or to exclude all legal <span class="accented">works</span>, done before, or even after justification, from any share in the office of justification. However true these positions may be, what is said here seems simply to mean that God's righteousness has been manifested in Christ in a different way, and on a different principle, from that of law. The principle of law is to enjoin and forbid, and to require complete obedience; but law, even as exhibited in the Divine Law of the Jews, has been shown to fail to enable man thus to attain to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; therefore, apart from this exacting principle, the righteousness of God is now revealed to man, embracing him in itself. The absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here, and its insertion in the latter clause of the same verse, where the Mosaic Law is definitely referred to, is fully explained by what has been said above under Romans 2:13. <span class="accented">Being witnessed</span>, etc., is introduced parenthetically by way of intimating that this manifestation of God's righteousness, though "apart from law," is not in any opposition to the teaching of the Law and the prophets, being, in fact, anticipated by them. The proof of this appears afterwards in ch. 4. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">Even the righteousness of God <i>which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ unto all</span> (<span class="accented">and upon all</span> is added in the Textus Receptus, but ill supported) <span class="cmt_word">them that believe: for there is no distinction.</span> We observe that the expression here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> but simply <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>.

But, even apart from the different, and in itself more obvious, meaning of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, where it occurs elsewhere, it is at least a question whether in the last cited passage it can be taken to mean praise or honour <span class="accented">from</span> God. It comes immediately after the quotation from <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc., followed by "These things said Esaias, when he saw <span class="accented">his glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and spoke of him." Hence the meaning of <a href="../../par/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a> may probably be that the persons spoken of loved <span class="accented">mundane</span> glory (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>) rather than the <span class="accented">Divine</span> glory, seen in the vision of faith, manifested to the world in Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory," etc.), and "loved" by those who have not the eyes blinded and the heart hardened. So, even in the previous passage of St. John's Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/5-41.htm">John 5:41, 44</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> may denote man's participation in the Divine glory, rather than praise or honour, while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may mean the mundane glory conferred by men on each other. These considerations commend, in the passage before us, the interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Significatur ipsius Dei viventis gloria, <span class="accented">vitam</span> tribuens (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>); ad quam homini, si non peccasset, patuit aditus: sod peccator ab illo fine sue excidit, neque jam eum assequitur, neque gloriam illam, quae in illo effulsisset, ullo mode tolerare potest: <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-20.htm">Hebrews 12:20</a>, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; quo fit ut morti sit obnoxius: nam gloria et immortalitas suut synonyma, et sic mors et corruptio. <span class="accented">Absunt a gloria Dei, i.e.</span> a summo fine homiuis aberrarunt. At justificati recuporant spom illius glorise. Vid. omnino c. 5:2, 11, 17; 8:30, etc." (Bengel). Further, the sense which the same expression seems evidently to bear in <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a> of this Epistle is of importance for our determination of its meaning here. We are not justified in understanding, with some interpreters, any specific reference to the "image of God" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in which man was created, and which has been lost by the Fall, there being nothing to suggest it, or, with others, <span class="accented">exclusively</span> to the future glory, since the present <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems to denote a present deficiency. The general conception appears sufficiently plain in Bengel's exposition above given, according to which "the glory of God" means the glory of the Divine righteousness ("sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" Bengel on <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), which man, through sin, falls short of.

The means whereby it becomes <span class="accented">objectively</span> possible is "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Here, as throughout St. Paul's Epistles, and in the New Testament generally, the doctrine of <span class="accented">atonement</span> being required for man's justification is undoubtedly taught, Christ being viewed as not only manifesting God's righteousness in his life, and reconciling believers through his influence on themselves, but as <span class="accented">effecting</span> such reconciliation by an atoning sacrifice. The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) here used may indeed sometimes denote <span class="accented">deliverance</span> only (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>); but certainly, when used of the redemption of man by Christ, it implies <span class="accented">atonement</span> by the payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; the ransom paid being said to be <span class="accented">himself</span>, or (as in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="accented">his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It does not follow that all conceptions of schools of theology as to how the atonement was efficacious for its purpose are correct or adequate. It must, from the very nature of the subject, remain to us a mystery. It may be enough for us to believe that whatever need the human conscience has ever felt of atonement for sin, whatever human want was expressed by world-wide rites of sacrifice, whatever especially was signified by the blood required for atonement in the Mosaic ritual, - all this is met and fulfilled for us in Christ's offering of himself, and that in him and through him we may now "come boldly to the throne of grace," having need of no other <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x2e;</span> 25 ("set forth," Authorized Version), may bear here its most usual classical sense of <span class="accented">exhibiting to view</span> ("ante omniam oculos possuit," Bengel); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the historical manifestation of the Redeemer. It may, however, mean "decreed," or "purposed" (cf. ch. 1:13; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems best taken as a neuter adjective used substantively, there being no instance of its application in the masculine to a person. Its ordinary use in the LXX (as also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) is to designate the lid of the ark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy-seat), the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (which is added <a href="../../par/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6</a>) being supposed to be always understood, though the usual designation is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Hence most commentators, including the Greek Fathers generally, understood <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in this sense here, Christ being regarded as the antitype of the mercy-seat, as being the medium of atonement and approach to God. The main objection to this view is that it involves an awkward confusion of metaphors, it being difficult to regard him who was at once the Victim whose blood was offered, and the High Priest who offered his own blood, <span class="accented">at the</span> mercy-seat, as being also the Mercy-seat itself. (Thus, however, Theodoret explains: "The mercy-seat of old was itself <span class="accented">bloodless, being</span> without life, but it received the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice. But the Lord Christ and God is at once Mercy-seat, High Priest, and Lamb.") The difficulty is avoided if we take the word here in the sense of <span class="accented">propitiatory offering</span>, which in itself it will bear, a noun, such as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, being supposed to be (cf. 4 Maccabees 17:22; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16. c. 7; Dio Chrys., 'Orat.,' 11:1). Whatever its exact meaning, it evidently denotes a true fulfilment in Christ of the atonement for sin undoubtedly signified by the type; as does further <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which follows. For a distinct enunciation of the significance of bleed under the ancient ritual, as reserved for and expressing atonement, see especially <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The meaning of the whole sacrificial ritual is there expressed as being that the life of man being forfeit to Divine justice, blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. Hence, in pursuance of this idea, the frequent references in the New Testament to Hebrews physical <span class="accented">blood-shedding</span> of Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"). It is not, however, implied that the material blood of Christ, shed on the cross, in itself cleanses the soul from sin, but only that it signifies to us the fulfilment in him of the type of an atoning sacrifice. As to the construction of ver. 25, it is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is to be taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning "through faith in his blood" (an unusual expression, though grammatically correct, cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>), or with <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, such as apparently to signify "in his own blood," favours the latter connection (cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-25</a>, where the offering of Christ is distinguished from those of the Law in being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus the meaning will be that he was set forth (or purposed) as an <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, available for us through faith, and consisting in the offering of himself - in, the shedding of his own blood. <span class="cmt_word">For showing of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God, in order to the showing of his righteousness in the time that now is, so that he may be righteous, and justifying</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> preceding) <span class="cmt_word">him that is of faith in Jesus</span>. This translation differs materially from that of the Authorized Version, which is evidently erroneous, especially in the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by "for the remission." Our translators, in a way very unusual with them, seem to have missed the drift of the passage, and so been led to give the above untenable rendering in order to suit their view of it. It is to be observed that two purposes of the <span class="accented">setting forth</span> (or <span class="accented">purposing</span>) of Christ Jesus as <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> here declared, both denoted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is repeated, being governed in the first clause of the sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and in the second by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. Some say that the preposition is changed with no intended difference of meaning. But it is not St. Paul's way to use his prepositions carelessly. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause may be taken to denote the immediate purpose of the propitiation, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the second to have its proper significance of <span class="accented">aim</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, denoting a further intention and result, consequent on the first. The first purpose, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, was the vindication of God's righteousness with regard to the ages past, in that he had so long <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or left unvisited, the sins of mankind. The propitiation of Christ. at length <span class="accented">set forth</span> (or, as may be expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, all along <span class="accented">purposed</span>), showed that he had not been indifferent to these sins, though <span class="accented">in his forbearance</span> he had passed them over. Cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where the death of Christ, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is said to have been "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant," the meaning and efficacy of the "death" being thus regarded, in the first place, as retrospective (cf. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). But then there was a further grand purpose, expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the second clause that of providing a way of present justification for believers now, without derogation of the Divine righteousness. Such appears to be the meaning of this passage.

Not so <span class="accented">practically.</span> But its <span class="accented">theory</span> would leave room for it, on the supposition of its conditions being fulfilled; it is a <span class="accented">kind</span> of law (observe <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>;) which does not exclude it; for if a man could say, "I have fulfilled all the righteousness of the Law," he would have something wherein to glory. But the <span class="accented">principle</span> of the law of faith, which has been shown to be the only one available for the justification of either Jew or Gentile, in itself excludes it. It will be observed that the strict sense of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, hitherto preserved, is extended in <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>.

This verse is in support of the doctrine, already asserted, and pervading the Epistle, of justification through Christ being for all mankind alike without distinction or partiality; and it comes in here in pursuance of the thought of the preceding verse.

It is of importance to grasp St. Paul's idea in his assertions of the <span class="accented">unity</span> of God. It is not that of <span class="accented">numerical</span> unity, but what may be called the unity of <span class="accented">quality</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere assertion of monotheism as against polytheism, but that the one God is one and the same to all, comprehending all in the embrace of his own essential unity. God's unity involved in St. Paul's mind the idea of "One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>); "who made of one blood every nation of men" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>); in whom we (all of us) "live and move and have our being" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). Thus exclusion of the Gentiles from the paternal embrace of the one God is incompatible with the very idea, so conceived, of his unity.

Regarded erroneously as a principle of <span class="accented">justification</span>, the apostle might have answered. "Yes, we do." But any disparagement of it, regarded in its true light and as answering its real purpose, he meets with an indignant <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. On the contrary, he says, we establish it. Law means the declaration of righteousness, and requirement of conformity to it on the part of man. We establish this principle by our doctrine of the necessity of atonement for man's defect. We put law on its true base, and so make it the more to stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by showing its office to be, not to <span class="accented">justify -</span> a position untenable - but to <span class="accented">convince of sin</span>, and so lead up to Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). In pursuance of this thought, the apostle, in the next chapter, shows that in the Old Testament itself it is <span class="accented">faith</span>, and not <span class="accented">law</span>, which is regarded as <span class="accented">justifying</span>; as, in the first place and notably, in the case of Abraham; thus proving the previous assertion in <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

Thus the promise to his seed, as well as to himself, rested on the principle of justification by faith only. The Law, of which the principle was essentially different, could not, and did not, in itself fulfil that promise; and that its fulfilment was not dependent on circumcision, or confined to the circumcised, is further shown by the fact that it was before his own circumcision that he received the blessing and the promise, Hence the seed intended in the promise was his spiritual seed, who are of faith such as his was; and in Christ, offering justification through faith to all, the promise is now fulfilled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall we say that Abraham our father according to the flesh hath found?</span> The connection, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the preceding argument is rather with vers. 27, 28 of ch. 3, than with its concluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This appears, not only from the drift of ch. 4, but also from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 2, connecting the thought with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="../../par/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The line of thought is, in the first place, this: We have said that all human glorying is shut out, and that no man can be justified except by faith: how, then (it is important to inquire), was it with Abraham our great progenitor? Did not he at least earn the blessing to his seed by the merit of his works? Had not he, on that ground, whereof to glory? No, not even he. Scripture, in what it says of him, distinctly asserts the contrary. There is uncertainty in this verse as to whether "according to the flesh" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) is to be connected with "our father" or with "hath found."

The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. But the great preponderance of authority is in favour of  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>.

Theodoret, among the ancients, connecting with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, explains <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> thus: "What righteousness, of Abraham's, wrought <span class="accented">before he believed God</span>, did we ever hear of?" Calvin suggests, as the meaning of the phrase (though himself inclining to the connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," naturaliter vel ex seipso." Bull, similarly ('Harmonic Apostolica,' 'Disputatio Posterior,' c. 12:14-17), "by his natural powers, without the grace of God." Alford, following Meyer, says that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> is in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that it "refers to that department of our being from which spring works, in contrast with that in which is the exercise of faith." Difficulty is avoided if (as is the most natural inference from the best authenticated reading) we take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of our forefather in the way of natural descent, the question being put from the Jewish standpoint; and this in distinction from the other conception of descent from Abraham, according to which all the faithful are called his children (cl. <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5, 8</a>:<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>).

It has a peculiar cogency in the general argument from being in connection with, and with reference to, one of the Divine promises to Abraham of an unnumbered seed; so that it may be understood with an extended application to those who were to inherit the blessing, as well as to the "father of the faithful," and so declaring the principle of justification for all the "children of the promise." Further, it would be peculiarly telling as addressed to the Jews, who made such a point of their descent from Abraham as the root of all their position of privilege (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>). The two significant expressions in it are <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (denoting faith, not works) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> The whole phrase, the apostle proceeds to say, implies that the reward spoken of was not earned, but granted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to grace, but according to the debt, i.e.</span> according to what is due). <span class="cmt_word">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness</span>. The expression, "him that worketh" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), evidently means him that works with a view to a reward which he can claim; or, as Luther explains it, "one who deals in works;" or, as we might say with the same signification, "the worker." (For a like use of the present participle, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>.) So also in ver. 5, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> means one who does <span class="accented">not</span> so work. Thus there is here no denial of the necessity of good works. <span class="accented">It is the principle only of justification</span> that is in view. "Neque enim fideles vult esse ignavos; sed tantum mercenarias esse vetat, qui a Deo quicquam reposcant quasi jure debitum" (Calvin). One view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>, being meant as an illustration, thus: The workman's wage is due to him, and not granted as a favour (so Afford). But this notion does not suit the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> in the following verse. The strong word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;</span> ("ungodly") is not to be understood as designating Abraham himself, the proposition being a general one. Nor does it imply that continued <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is consistent with justification; only that even the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are justified through faith on their repentance and amendment (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>).

The introduction of this testimony of David to the same principle of justification serves not only to explain it further, but also to show that under the Law too it continued to be recognized; and by David himself, the typical king and psalmist under the legal dispensation. But the argument from Abraham is not discontinued, being resumed in the next verse, and continued to the end of the chapter. If it be said that these verses from <a href="../../par/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>. do not in themselves declare a general principle applicable to all, but only the blessedness to <span class="accented">sinners</span> of having their sins forgiven, it may be replied, firstly, that the way in which the verses are introduced does not require more to be implied. All that <span class="accented">need</span> be meant is that the ground of justification exemplified in Abraham's case is the same as is spoken of by David as still available for man, and crowned with blessing. But, secondly, it is to be observed that these verses represent and suggest the general tenor of the Book of Psalms, in which human righteousness is never asserted as constituting a claim to reward. "My trust is in thy mercy," is, on the contrary, the ever-recurring theme. St. Paul's quotations from the Old Testament are frequently given as suggestive of the general scriptural teaching on the subject in hand, rather than as exhaustive proofs in themselves.

Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision</span>. Faith, and not works, having been shown to be the principle of Abraham's justification, and those who were under the Mosaic Law, represented by David, having been seen to have shared the blessing of being so justified, the question still remains, whether it may not be confined to them only, or to Abraham's circumcised descendants only. That this cannot be is shown in two ways: firstly (vers. 10-13), from the fact that Abraham was himself <span class="accented">uncircumcised</span> when he was spoken of as being thus justified, so that neither the capability nor the inheritance of such justification can be viewed as dependent on circumcision; and, secondly (vers. 13-16), it is argued that the Law could not appropriate the privilege to his carnal descendants, the very principle of law being the opposite of that on which Abraham is said to have been justified. Thus the <span class="accented">seed</span>, innumerable as the stars, to be understood as inheritors of the promise made to him, and sharers in his blessing, are not his circumcised descendants, but a spiritual seed - they which are of faith being the true children of Abraham (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had yet</i> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision</span> (this was all that circumcision was - a visible sign and seal to his own descendants of the righteousness that is of faith; but not confining it to them, or in itself conferring it) <span class="cmt_word">that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them also. And the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision</span>. The intention of ver. 12 is to express that, though the faithful who are not of Israel are Abraham's children, yet his circumcised descendants have not lost their privilege. They are already his children according to the flesh, and his spiritual children too, if they walk in the steps of his faith (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a>, "I know that ye are Abraham's seed," compared with ver. 39, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham"). What now follows is to show (as above explained) that the Law could not be the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham, or appropriate its blessing to the Jews.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <i>was</i> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For not through law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith, For if they which are of law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect. For the Law worketh wrath: for where no law is, neither is there transgression</span>. The point of the argument is that the principle of law is essentially different from that on which Abraham was justified, and which is hence to be understood in the fulfilment of the promise to him and his seed. How this is so is shortly intimated in ver. 15, the idea being more fully expounded in ch. 7. The idea is (as has been already explained) that law simply <span class="accented">declares</span> what is right, and <span class="accented">requires</span> conformity to it; it does not give either <span class="accented">power</span> to obey, or <span class="accented">atonement</span> for not obeying. Hence, in itself, it worketh, not righteousness, but <span class="accented">wrath</span>; for man becomes fully liable to wrath when he comes to know, through law, the difference between right and wrong (cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin"). Exactly the same view of the impossibility of the Mosaic Law being the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham is found in <a href="../../par/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, where also the real purpose of the Law, intervening thus between the promise and its fulfilment, is further explained. The expression in ver. 13, "that he should be the heir of the world," has reference to the ultimate scope of the Abrahamic promises (see <a href="../../par/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 6, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-9</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>). Now, it is true that in some of these promises the language used seems to denote no more than the temporal possession by Israel of the promised land, with dominion (actually realized under David and Solomon) over the whole country from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc. But their full scope transcends any such limited fulfilment, as where it is said that the promised seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the dust of the earth that cannot be numbered, and that in it all the nations of the earth should be blessed. The prophets accordingly recognized a far larger ultimate fulfilment in their frequent pictures of the Messiah's universal dominion; and there was no need for the apostle to prove here what the Jews already understood. The only difference between the view current among them and his would be that they would mostly have in view a universal worldly sovereignty with its local centre on the throne of David at Jerusalem, while he interpreted spirttually, seeing beyond the outward framework of prophetic visions to the ideal they imply.

It is to be observed that, though Abraham himself in ver. 13 is spoken of as "the heir of the world," yet the preceding expression, "to Abrabam or to his seed," sufficiently intimates that it is in his seed, identified with him, that he is conceived as so inheriting.

The purport of the whole passage is to show, with reference to <a href="../../par/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-16</a>, how Abraham's faith in the promise of a seed through Sarah, which seemed impossible in the natural course of things, corresponded in essence to our faith in "him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead" (ver. 24). It was faith in a Divine power above nature, able to quicken into supernatural life that which humanly is dead. And as Abraham's faith in this promised birth of Isaac involved a further faith in the fulfilment through him of all the promises, so our faith in the resurrection of Christ involves faith in all that is signified and assured to us thereby - in "the power of a Divine life" in him, to bring life out of death, to regenerate and quicken the spiritually dead, and finally in "eternal redemption" and the "restitution of all things" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18-23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; to which many other similarly significant passages might be added). It may be observed that, not only in the instance here adduced, but in his whole life as recorded in Genesis, Abraham stands forth as an exemplification of habitual faith in a Divine order beyond sight, and trust in Divine promises. In this consists the religious meaning of that record for us all. Notably so (as is especially set forth in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a>, etc.) in his willingness to sacrifice the son through whom the promise was to be fulfilled, retaining still his faith in the fulfilment.

Instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of the Textus Receptus, an overwhelming preponderance of authority, including uncials, versions, and Fathers, supports <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("let us have"). If this be the true reading, the expression must be intended as hortatory, meaning, apparently, "Let us appreciate and realize our peace with God which we have in being justified by faith." But hortation here does not appear in keeping with what follows, in which the results of our being justified by faith are described in terms clearly, corresponding with the idea of our having peace with God. The passage as a whole is not hortatory, but descriptive, and "we have peace" comes in naturally as an initiatory statement of what is afterwards carried out. This being the case, it is a question whether an exception may not be allowed in this case to the usually sound rule of bowing to decided preponderance of authority with respect to readings. That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> was an early and widely accepted reading there can be no doubt; but still it may not have been the original one, the other appearing more probable. Scrivener is of opinion that "the itacism of <span class="greek">&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;</span>, so familiar to all collators of Greek manuscripts, crept into some very early copy, from which it was propagated among our most venerable codices, even those from which the earliest versions were made."

Our translators seem in this verse to have departed from their usual rendering because of the substantive "glory," in a different sense, which follows) <span class="cmt_word">in hope of the glory of God</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> (translated "access") occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> and Ephesians 3:12; in both cases, as here, with the article, so as to denote some well-known access or approach. It means the access to the holy God, which had been barred by sin, but which has been opened to us through Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19</a>). It is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is properly taken (as in the Authorized Version) in immediate connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, as denoting that <span class="accented">into</span> which we have our access. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> the word is followed by the more suitable preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the phrase being, "access to the Father;" and this may be understood here, the sense being, "We have through Christ our access (<span class="accented">to the Father</span>) <span class="accented">unto</span> (ie. so as to result in) the state of grace and acceptance in which we now stand." As to "the glory of God," see above on Romans 3:23. Here our hoped-for <span class="accented">future</span> participation in the Divine glory is more distinctly intimated by the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>. This last phrase bears the same sense as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>, and probably in <a href="../../par/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a> above. It does not mean that hope is that wherein we glory, but that, being in a state of hope, we glory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">And not only <i>so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations</span> (or, our <span class="accented">tribulations</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost which is given to us</span>. The peace, the joy, the hope, that come of faith might be supposed unable to stand against the facts of this present life, in which, to those first believers, only peculiar tribulations might seem to follow from their faith. Not so, says the apostle; nay, their very tribulations tend to confirm our hope, and so even in them we also glory. For we perceive how they serve for our probation now: they test our endurance; and proved endurance increases hope. And this hope does not shame us in the end, as being baseless and without fulfilment; for our inward experience of the love of God assures us of the contrary, and keeps it ever alive. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> ("experience," Authorized Version) means properly "proof," and is so translated elsewhere. The idea is that tribulations test, and endurance under them proves, the genuineness of faith; and approved faithfulness strengthens hope (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-13.htm">Mark 13:13</a>, "He that <span class="accented">endureth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> here) to the end, the same shall be saved "). By "the love of God" is meant rather God's love to us than ours to God. What follows in explanation requires this sense. Of course, it kindles answering love in ourselves (cf. "We love God, because he first loved us"); but the idea here is that of God's own love, the sense of which we experience, flooding our hearts with itself through the gift of the Holy Spirit. It may be observed that, though assurance of the fulfilment of our hope is here made to rest on inward feeling, yet this is legitimately convincing to those who do so feel. As in many other matters, so especially in religion, it is internal consciousness that carries the strongest conviction with it, and induces certitude. The verses that come next set forth the grounds of our sense of God's exceeding love to us.

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet</span> (<span class="accented">literally,for</span>) <span class="cmt_word">peradventure for the good man some would even dare to die</span>. The general purport of ver. 7 is obvious, viz. to show how Christ's death for the ungodly transcends all human instances of self-sacrifice for others. But the exact import of the language used is not equally plain. That of the first clause, indeed, and its connection with what precedes, presents no difficulty. The meaning is that Christ's dying for the <span class="accented">ungodly</span> is a proof of love beyond what is common among men. The second clause seems to be added as a concession of what some men may perhaps sometimes be capable cf. It is introduced by a second <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> (this being the reading of all the manuscripts), which may be meant <span class="accented">as exceptive</span>, "I do not press this without exception," being understood. So Alford; and in this case the "yet" of the Authorized Version, or <span class="accented">though</span>, may give its meaning. Or it may be connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, thus: "Scarcely, I say, for there may possibly be cases," etc. But what is the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the first clause and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the second? Some interpreters say that there is none, the intention being simply to express the possibility of human self-sacrifice for one that is good or righteous in some rare cases. But the change of the word, which would, according to this view, be purposeless, and still more the insertion of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, forbids this interpretation. One view is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is neuter, meaning that, though for a righteous individual one can hardly be found to be willing to die, yet for the cause of good, for what a man regards as the highest good, or <span class="accented">pro bone publico</span> (it might be), such self-sacrifice may be possible; This view is tenable, though against it is the fact that death in behalf of <span class="accented">persons</span> is being spoken of all along. The remaining and most commonly accepted view is that by "the good man" (the article pointing him out generally as a well-known type of character) is meant the beneficent - one who inspires attachment and devotion - as opposed to one who is merely just. Cicero ('De Off.,' 3:15) is quoted in support of this distinction between the words: "Si vir bonus is est qui prodest quibus potest, nemini nocet, recte <span class="accented">justum</span> virum, <span class="accented">bonum</span> non facile reperiemus." Tholuck quotes, as a Greek instance, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (AElian, 'Var. Histor.,' 3:17). Possibly the term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> would have a well-understood meaning to the readers of the Epistle, which is not equally obvious to us.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God commendeth his own love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</span>. The emphatic "his own" is lost sight of in the Authorized Version. It is not in contrast to <span class="accented">our</span> love to God, but expressive of the thought that the love of God himself towards men was displayed in the death of Christ. This is important for our true conception of the light in which the mysterious doctrine of the atonement is regarded in Holy Scripture. It is not (as represented by some schools of theologians) that the Son, considered apart from the Father, offered himself to appease his wrath - as seems to be expressed in the lines, "Actus in crucem factus es Irato Deo victima" - but rather that the Divine love itself purposed from eternity and provided the atonement, all the Persons of the holy and undivided Trinity concurring to effect it (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>: <a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>, <span class="accented">et</span> al.). If it be asked how this Divine love, displayed in the atonement, and therefore previous to it, is consistent with what is elsewhere so continually said of the Divine wrath, we answer that the ideas are not irreconcilable. The wrath expresses God's necessary antagonism to sin, and the retribution due to it, inseparable from a true conception of the Divine righteousness; and as long as men arc under the dominion of sin they are of necessity involved in it: But this is not inconsistent with ever-abiding Divine love towards the persons of sinners, or with an eternal purpose to redeem them. It may be added here that the passage Before us intimates our Lord's essential Deity; for his sacrifice of himself is spoken of as the display of God's own love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Much more then, being now justified by</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">his life</span>. In these verses, the second being an amplification of the first, our relations to God are set forth, as before, by the analogy of such as may subsist between man and man. Men do not usually die for their enemies, but they do seek the good of their friends. If, then, God's superhuman love reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son when we were still his enemies, what assurance may we not now feel, being no longer at enmity, of being saved from the wrath (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 9) to which, as sinners and enemies, we were exposed! There is also a significance (ver. 10)in the words "death" and "life." Christ's death was for atonement, and in it we are conceived as having died with him to our former state of alienation from God. His resurrection was the inauguration of a new life to God, in which with him we live (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The words "enemies" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) and "reconciled" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) invite attention. Does the former word imply mutual enmity, or only that we were God's enemies? We may answer that, though we cannot attribute enmity in its proper human sense to God, or properly speak of him as under any circumstances the enemy of man, yet the expression might perhaps be used with regard to him in the way of accommodation to human ideas, as are anger, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>, and the like. There seems, however, to be no necessity for this conception here, the idea being rather that of man's alienation from God, and from peace with him, through sin; as in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, "And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works."

With regard to reconciled," it may be first observed that, however orthodox and capable of a true sense it may be to speak of God being reconciled to man through Christ (as in Art. 2, "to reconcile his Father to us"), the expression is not scriptural. It is always man who is said to be reconciled to God; and it is God who, in Christ, reconciles the world unto himself (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>). Still, mere is evidently implied than that God reconciles men to himself by changing their hearts and converting them from sin by the manifestation of his love in Christ. The reconciliation is spoken of as effected once for all for all mankind in the atonement, independently of, and previously to, the conversion of believers. Faith only appropriates, and obedience testifies, the appropriation of an accomplished reconciliation available for all mankind. That such is the view in the passage before us is distinctly evident from all that follows after ver. 12.

Yes, this remains true - in ourselves we cannot glory; but in God, who has reconciled us, we can and do. It is to be observed that neither this nor other passages (such as <a href="../../par/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>), where an exultant assurance of salvation is expressed, justify the doctrine of assurance, as sometimes understood; viz. in the sense that an individual believer may and ought to feel certain of his own final salvation, on the ground of having once been justified.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-21.</span> - (b) From consideration of the blessed effects on believers of faith in the reconciliation through Christ, the apostle now passes to <span class="accented">the effects of that reconciliation as the position of the whole human race before God.</span> His drift is that the reconciliation corresponds to the original transgression; both proceeded from <span class="accented">one</span>, and both include all mankind in their results; as the one introduced <span class="accented">sin</span> into the world, and, as its consequence, <span class="accented">death</span>, so the other introduced <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, and, as its consequence, <span class="accented">life</span>. It may be observed that in ch. 1 also he has in one sense traced sin backward through the past ages, so as to show how all mankind had come to be under condemnation for it. But the subject was regarded from a different point of view, the purpose of the argument being also different. There he was addressing the heathen world, his purpose being to convince the whole of it of sin, on the score of obvious culpability; and, suitably to this design, his argument is based, not on Scripture, but on observation of the facts of human nature and human history. It did not fall within his scope to trace the evil to its original cause. But here, having shown Jew and Gentile to be on the same footing with respect to sin, and having entered (at <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>) on the doctrinal portion of his Epistle, he goes to Scripture for the origin of the evil, and finds it there attributed to Adam's original transgression, which implicated the human race as an organic whole. This is the scriptural solution of the mystery, which he here gives, not only as accounting for things being as they are, but also, in connection with the stage of the argument at which he has now arrived, as explaining the necessity and the purpose of the atonement for the whole guilty race, effected by the second Adam, Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all sinned</span>. To this sentence, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, there is no apodosis. One has been sought in the course of what follows, and by some found in ver. 18. But ver. 18 is a recapitulation rather than resumption of the argument, and is, further, too far removed to be intended as a formal apodesis. It is not really necessary to find one. The natural one to the first clause of the sentence would have been, "So through One <span class="accented">righteousness</span> entered into the world, and <span class="accented">life</span> through righteousness;" and such may be supposed to have been in the writer's mind. But, after his manner, he goes off to enlarge on the idea expressed in the second clause, and never formally completes his sentence. A similar anacoluthon is found in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>. Sin is here, as elsewhere, regarded as a <span class="accented">power</span> antagonistic to God, which has been introduced into the world of man, working and manifesting itself in concrete human sin (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-21.htm">Romans 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8, 9, 17</a>). Its ultimate origin is not explained. Scripture offers no solution of the old insoluble problem, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>: its existence at all under the sway of the Omnipotent Goodness in which we believe is one of the deep mysteries that have ever baffled human reason. All that is here touched on is its entrance into the world of man, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> implying that it already existed beyond this mundane sphere. The reference is, of course, to Gem fit., as the scriptural account of the beginning of sin in our own world. It is there attributed to "the serpent," whom we regard as a symbol of some mysterious power of evil, external to man, to which primeval man, in the exercise of his prerogative of free-will, succumbed, and so let sin in. Through <span class="accented">sin</span> entered also <span class="accented">death</span> as its consequence; which (primarily at least) must mean here physical death, this being all that is denoted in Genesis (comp. Genesis 3:19 with Gen 2:17), and necessary to be understood in what follows in the chapter before us (see ver. 14). But here a difficulty presents itself to modern thought. Are we to understand that man was originally so constituted as not to die? - that even his bodily organization was immortal, and would have continued so but for the fatal taint of sin? We find it difficult at the present day to conceive this, however bound we may feel to submit our reason to revelation in a matter so remote, so unknown, and so mysterious as the beginning of human life on the earth, in whatever aspect viewed, and indeed of all conscious life, must ever be. But St. Paul himself, in another place, speaks of "the first man" having been, even on his first creation, "of the earth, earthy" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45, 47</a>), with a body, like ours, of" flesh and blood," in its own nature corruptible (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>). Neither is the narrative of <a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. inconsistent with this idea. For it seems to imply that, but for his eating of the mystical "tree of life" (whatever may be meant by it), the first man was in his own nature mortal, and that his liability to death ensued on his being debarred from it (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>). It may be impossible for us to understand or explain. The following considerations, however, may perhaps help us in some degree. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> When we pay regard to man's spiritual capabilities and aspirations, even as he is now, death does seem to us an anomaly - a contradiction to the ideal of his inner self. That a beast of the field should die appears to us no such anomaly; for it has done all that it seems to have been meant to do, or to be capable of doing: it has served as a link in the continuance of its kind, not having been conscious, as far as we know, of anything beyond its surroundings. But man (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> man as he is capable of being, so as to represent the capacity of humanity) connects himself in his inner self with eternity; his mind resents the idea of death, as an unwelcome stoppage to its development and its yearnings. It goes on ever maturing its power, enlarging its range, thirsting for higher knowledge, entertaining affections that seem eternal; and then bodily decay and death arrest its progress as it were in mid-career. Thus death, as it comes to us and affects us now, seems to involve a contradiction between man's inner consciousness and the facts of his existence at present; it is shrunk from as something that ought not to be. It is true that, when faith has once grasped the idea of bodily death being but a transition to a better life, the anomaly disappears: but such is its aspect to the natural man: and thus we can enter into the scriptural idea of death, as it comes to us so inevitably now, being something not originally meant for man, though we may be unable to say how it would have been with him had not sin entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though physical death, obvious to men's eyes, and not spiritual death of the soul either in this world or in the world to come, is here evidently in view (see ver. 14), yet we must bear in mind the general idea associated with the word "death" in the New Testament. It is sometimes used so as to imply more than the mere parting of the soul from the body, including in the conception of what it is all the woes and infirmities that flesh is heir to, which are its precursors in the present state of things (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>), being thus regarded also as the visible sign before our eyes of man's present alienation from the life that is in God. St. Paul, then, in the passage before us, though alleging mere natural death as sufficient evidence of sin, may be conceived as having in his view Death armed as he has been with a peculiar sting to man through all known time. The main point of his argument is that the doom recorded in Genesis as having been pronounced on Adam had obviously remained in force throughout the ages; and there is surely no difficulty in assenting to the position that the dominion of death, as it has been exercised since that doom, is evidence of its continuance, and consequently of sin. "For that all sinned" (more correctly so than, as in the Authorized Version, "all have sinned") seems to mean, not that all since Adam in their own persons committed sin, but that all sinned in him - were implicated in the sin of the progenitor (cf. ver. 15; also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "in Adam all die;" and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>, where all are said to have died <span class="accented">to</span> sin in the death of Christ). The doctrine of <span class="accented">original</span>, as distinct from <span class="accented">actual</span>, sin, thus intimated, has been, as is well known, the subject of much controversy since the time of Pelagius. It does not fall within the proper scope of this Commentary to discuss the theories of divines, but rather to set forth candidly what the language of the portions of Scripture commented on in itself most obviously means, viewed in the light afforded by general Scripture teaching. With respect to the passage before us, it may suffice to say: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That more must be understood than the mere <span class="accented">imputation</span> of Adam's transgression to his descendants, irrespectively of any guilt of theirs. This notion, which jars on our conception of Divine justice, is precluded by the entire drift of the earlier chapters of this Epistle, which was the actual <span class="accented">culpability</span> of mankind at large, and also by what follows here, sin itself being spoken of - not the imputation of it only - as being in the world after Adam, and universal too, as evidenced by the continued reign of death. All men are said to have sinned in the sin of the first transgressor, because sin was thus introduced, as a power in human nature antagonistic to God, and because this "infection of nature" has continued since. And thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Pelagian position is also precluded, according to which "original sin standeth (<span class="accented">only</span>) in the following of Adam" (Art. 9.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in actual imitation of his sin, which man is supposed to have still, as Adam had, the power to avoid. For it is expressly said (ver. 14) that death reigned over - in proof that sin infected - even those who had not sinned after the similitude of his transgression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we must guard against confusion between the idea of man's natural liability to condemnation on the ground of transmitted sinfulness, and that of God's actual dealing with him. It is nowhere said or implied that the natural infection which they could not help will be visited on individuals in the final judgment. All that is insisted on by St. Paul is that man, in himself, as he is now, falls short of the glory of God, and cannot put in a plea for acceptance on the ground of his own righteousness. But he no less emphatically declares that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For until Law</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all through the time previous to the revelation of law) <span class="cmt_word">sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.

The purport of these two verses, connected by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 12, is to prove that the primeval sin did really infect and implicate the whole race of mankind. It might be supposed that those only would be implicated who had themselves transgressed, as Adam did, a known command; it being an acknowledged principle of Divine justice that only sin against law of which the sinner is conscious is imputed to him for con-detonation (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). Nay. but the universal dominion of death, the doom of sin, over all alike, whether or not they had themselves so sinned, was proof that sin was all along dominant in the world, infecting all. The Mosaic Law is spoken of as the distinct revelation of Divine Law to man; and therefore attention is first drawn to the fact that before that revelation, no less than after it, death had reigned over all. But is it thus implied that until the Law from Mount Sinai men had been without any kind of law, for transgressing which they were responsible? Not so. That Law is indeed regarded as the first definite enunciation of law under evident Divine sanction, after which, to those that were under it, sin became indubitably and exceeding sinful; but that men are conceived as having sinned previously against law of some kind, appears from the phrase, "<span class="accented">Even</span> <span class="accented">over those</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> consciously against a known command. This surely implies that some had so sinned; and thus the essential point of the argument is that even over those who had not so sinned (such as the unenlightened and invincibly ignorant, or persons dying in infancy) death had equally reigned. <span class="cmt_word">Who is the figure of him that was to come</span>. This is added so as to bring round the thought to the main subject of the chapter, viz. the reconciliation of all mankind through Christ, to which the scriptural account of the condemnation of all mankind through Adam had, at ver. 12, been adduced as analogous. <span class="accented">Who</span> refers to Adam, who has just been for the first time named; <span class="accented">he that was to come</span> is Christ, who is called, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>, "the last Adam." Adam was a type (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ in that both represented entire humanity; one as the representative and author of fallen, the other of restored, humanity - the transgression of the one and the obedience of the other alike affecting all (see vers 18, 19). But there is a difference between the two cases; and this is pointed out in vers. 15, 16, 17, which follow.

The purport of these verses is (while keeping up the view of condemnation and justification being both derived to all from one) to show how the effects of the latter for good far transcend those of the former for evil. It is not easy, however, to explain the apostle's exact intention in the contrasts which he draws. He seems to have written, after his manner, full of ideas which he did not linger to arrange in clear form. In ver. 15 the contrast between "trespass" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) and "free gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) seems to be the leading idea. The suggesting thought seems to be - If (as has been shown) one man's trespass had such far-reaching effects, much more must the <span class="accented">grace of God</span> (displayed also in One) have no less far-reaching effects. God's grace must be more powerful than man's trespass. And it is here asserted that it was so. The <span class="accented">much more</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is best taken (as it must be in ver. 17) in a <span class="accented">logical</span>, not a <span class="accented">quantitative</span> sense; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as enforcing the conclusion, not as intensifying the verb "abounded." So far the effects are not distinctly contrasted in respect to their <span class="accented">extent</span>; all that is implied in this verse is that both reach <span class="accented">to the many</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole human race collectively; unless, indeed, the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> implies excess of effect. It is to be observed that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> does not here mean, as is usual in classical Greek, <span class="accented">the greater part</span>, but the <span class="accented">multitude</span>, mankind being regarded collectively. It depends, however, on the writer's mental horizon whether the phrase, taken by itself, is to be understood as comprehending <span class="accented">all</span>. The consideration is of importance in the case before us. On the one hand, it may be contended that, in the first clause of the verse, "the many" must mean <span class="accented">all</span>, for that undoubtedly all died (cf. ver. 12, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), and that consequently <span class="accented">all</span> must be intended also in the second clause. So also in ver. 19, where it is said that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>. And it may be said, further, that the drift of the whole argument requires the view of the effects of the re- demption being at least coextensive with the effects of the fall. But, on the other hand, it is argued that St. Paul would not have used the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> in vers. 15 and 19 instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> as in vers. 12 and 18, unless he had intended some difference of meaning, and that he varied his expression in order to avoid the necessary inference that all would be saved in fact. Certainly he teaches that the redemption is <span class="accented">available</span> and <span class="accented">intended</span> for all, as in ver. 18 where it is said to be <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; and this, it may be said, is enough to satisfy the view of its effects (i<span class="accented">.e.</span> in purpose and potentially) being coextensive with the effects of the fall But it does not seem to follow that man's resistance to grace might not come in as a bar to the entire fulfilment of the Divine purpose; and hence these passages cannot be pressed as conclusive for the doctrine of universal final salvation. But in vers. 16, 17 (to be taken together, ver. 16 being introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, so as to suggest a new idea, and ver. 17 being connected with it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) the <span class="accented">extent</span> to which grace thus abounded, so as to <span class="accented">transcend</span> the effects of the original transgression, is distinctly set forth. The thought of these verses may, perhaps, be expressed otherwise, thus: The one trespass of the one original transgressor did indeed render all mankind liable to condemnation; but the free gift in Christ annulled the effect, not only of that one trespass, but also of all subsequent trespasses of mankind; an immense debt, accumulating through the ages of human history, in addition to the original debt, was by that one free grant obliterated. And further, while the original trespass introduced a temporary reign of <span class="accented">death</span>, the free gift of righteousness introduced <span class="accented">life</span>, in which the partakers of the gift themselves - triumphant over Death, who reigned before - shall reign; and, as in ver. 15 the idea was that God's grace must be more powerful than man's sin, so here it is implied that life in Christ must be more powerful than death in Adam. <span class="accented">Life</span> means here (as elsewhere when the life in Christ is spoken of) more than the present life in the flesh - more than the life breathed into. man when he first "became (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) a living soul" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). It means the higher life imparted by "the last Adam," who "became a quickening Spirit" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>); eternal life with God, in the life of Christ risen, swallowing up mortality (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). Thus the "free gift" not only reverses the far-reaching effects of the original transgression, but even transcends what is intimated in Genesis as given to man in Paradise before his fall. The next two verses (18, 19), introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, are a summing up of what has been already said or implied.

"Declaratio Divina ilia, qua peccator, mortis reus, vitae adjudicatur, idque jure" (Bengel).

But there is no verb to make clear the force of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. It may denote the result to which a cause tends, without implying its inevitable accomplishment. Thus (<a href="../../par/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>), <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>,<span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, where the same preposition expresses both the intended result of life and the actual result of death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One shall the many be made righteous.</span> As to the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, see under ver. 15. The phrase, if taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, would seem here to imply even more than in ver. 15; for there it was only said that "the gift...  abounded unto the many;" here an actual result is expressed by the future, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But even so the universality of final salvation need not necessarily follow. The phrase is, "shall be constituted righteous," and might only mean that all will be put into the position of justified persons, capable as such of salvation, just as all had, through the first transgression, been put into the position of sinners, liable as such to condemnation; and the future tense might be taken to denote the continuance, through all future ages, of the availing effect of the accomplished atonement. Further, it may be remarked that if universal final salvation did seem to follow from the passage before us, it would still have to be understood consistently with the purport of ch. 6, 7, and 8, which follow. In them the practical result to the believer of his justification through Christ is treated; and renunciation of sin, "living after the Spirit," is postulated as the condition for attaining the life eternal. Hence, if the doctrine of "eternal hope" be sound (and who can fail to desire that it should be so?), it must be to some unknown reconciliation beyond the limits of the present life that we must look in the case of those who have not fulfilled the necessary conditions here. Thus, further, the doctrine cannot legitimately be allowed to affect our view of our responsibilities now. To us the only doctrine distinctly revealed on the subject of salvation is that it is in this present life that we are to make our "calling and election sure." Two ways are put before us - the way of life, and the way of death; the one leading to <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the other to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. In vers. 6-10 (as elsewhere, see note on Romans 3:25) it was through the <span class="accented">death</span>, the <span class="accented">blood</span>, of Christ that we were said to have been reconciled to God; here it is through his <span class="accented">obedience</span>, opposed to the <span class="accented">disobedience</span> of Adam. Though the doctrine of the atonement, in all its depth, is beyond our comprehension now (see above on ver. 9), yet it is important for us to observe the various aspects in which it is presented to us in Scripture. Here the idea suggested is that of Christ, as the Representative of humanity, satisfying Divine righteousness by perfect <span class="accented">obedience</span> to the Divine will, and thus offering to God for man what man had lest the power of offering (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, "Lo, I come to fulfil thy will, O my God;" and <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-9.htm">Hebrews 10:9</a>, <span class="accented">et seq</span>.; also <a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, "became <span class="accented">obedient</span> unto death, even the death of the cross"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.

Here <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (though without the article; see under ver. 13) refers to the Mosaic Law, the purpose of which in the economy of redemption is thus intimated, so as to complete the view. It was God's purpose from the first that grace should in the end triumph over sin; but in the mean time law came in (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in the cognate passage, <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). For what end? Not in itself to accomplish the purpose, not to interfere with its accomplishment, but as an intervening dispensation to prepare for its accomplishment, by convincing of sin, and making it exceeding sinful, and so establishing the need of, and exciting a craving for, redemption. This intervening preparatory office of the Mosaic Law is set forth more at length in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19-26</a>; and the working of the principle of law to this end in the human consciousness is analyzed in ch. 7. of this Epistle. <span class="accented">Additional Note on ver.</span>12The significance of the words "life" and "death," as used in St. Paul's Epistles and elsewhere, demands peculiar attention. They evidently bear a sense in many places different from that of ordinary use; and this in accordance with our Lord's own recorded language, as, for instance, in his memorable words to Martha, given in <a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>. The following considerations may aid our comprehension of what is meant. The mysterious principle or potency of life, even in the common acceptation of the term, varies not only in degree, but in kind; and the same living organism may be at the same time alive with respect to its own mode of vitality, and dead with respect to some higher one which vivifies others. The plant, while alive with respect to its own kind of life, is dead to the higher life of sentient beings. The brute beast, while alive with respect to mere animal life, is dead, as it were, to the higher life of intelligent man. A whole world of environing influences to which the mind of man responds, so as to live in them, are to the brute as nothing; it may be said to be dead to them. Now, Scripture teaches, and we believe, that there is a spiritual sphere of things above and beyond this visible sphere, which man is capable of apprehending, being influenced by, and living a still higher life than his natural life therein. He is thus capable through the higher and diviner part of his mysterious being, called by St. Paul his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), when in touch with the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. For man to be in vital correspondence with his spiritual environments is spiritual life; to be out of correspondence with them is spiritual death. And so, as the plant is dead to sentient life, though alive in its own life; or as the brute may be said to be dead to the higher life of man, though alive in mere animal life; so man may be dead as to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> life, though alive as to <span class="accented">psychical</span> life; and thus "dead while he liveth" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, "The natural man (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." In other words, he is dead to them). Further, this spiritual life, unlike the psychical life, is ever spoken of as <span class="accented">eternal.</span> For it consists in intercommunion of man's immortal part with the spiritual sphere of things which is eternal. Nor does natural death interrupt it; for it is not dependent for its continuance, as is psychical life, on environments from which we are severed by the body's death, but on such as are eternal. Thus, too, we see how it is that eternal life is regarded, not as one that will have its commencement after death, but as one to be enjoyed at present, and to which we are to rise in Christ even now. This idea is notably expressed in our Lord's words above referred to: "I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die" (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). Doubtless we are bidden to look forward to a fulness and perfection of the eternal life, of which our present enjoyment of it is but an earnest, in the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) in store for us hereafter - cf. "Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet manifested what we shall be," etc. (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>) - but still this is regarded as but the consummation of a life already begun. On the other hand, whatever penal consequences of a state of spiritual death may be spoken of as in store hereafter for the wicked, it is regarded as being itself but the continuance of a state of death in which they are before they pass away (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). In <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc., to which this note refers, the above view of what is often meant by "death" ought to be kept before us. For, though the apostle seems evidently to be speaking of the natural death that comes to all, he must be taken as regarding it as but the symbol and evidence of the sway of that spiritual death to which all men are now, in their fallen nature, liable.

And first is shown from various points of view - <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-7:6.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) <span class="accented">The obligation believers of holiness of life.</span> The subject is led up to by meeting certain <span class="accented">supposed</span> erroneous conclusions from what has been said in the preceding chapter. It might be said that, if where sin abounded grace did much more abound - if in the obedience of the one Christ all believers are justified - human sin must be a matter of indifference; it cannot nullify the free gift; nay, grace will be even the more enhanced, in that it abounds the more. The apostle rebuts such antinomian conclusions by showing that they imply a total misunderstanding of the doctrine which was supposed to justify them; for that our partaking in the righteousness of God in Christ means our actually partaking in it - our being influenced by it, loving it and following it, not merely our having it imputed to us while we remain aloof from it; that justifying faith in Christ means spiritual union with Christ, a dying with him to sin and a rising with him to a new life, in which sin shall no longer have dominion over us. He refers to our baptism as having this only meaning, and he enforces his argument by three illustrations: firstly, as aforesaid, that of dying and rising again, which is signified in baptism (vers. 1-14); secondly, that of service to a master (vers. 15-23); thirdly, that of the relation of a wife to a husband (<a href="../../par/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-16</a>). It will be seen, when we come to it, that the third of these illustrations is a carrying out of the same idea, though it is there <span class="accented">law</span>, and not <span class="accented">sin</span>, that we are said to be emancipated from. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then?</span> So St. Paul introduces a difficulty or objection arising out of the preceding argument (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span> Referring to the whole preceding argument, and especially to the concluding verses (<a href="../../par/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20, 21</a>).

But cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, where the same expression occurs, and where <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span> appears only to imply a question. The expression <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;</span> also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; in the first of these texts with reference to the Israelites and Moses. It denotes the entering by baptism into close union with a person, coming to belong to him, so as to be in a sense identified with him. In <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a> being <span class="accented">baptized</span> into Christ is understood as implying <span class="accented">putting him on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, were understood to imply the same idea, though not so plainly expressing it. Thus St. Paul rejoiced that he had not himself baptized many at Corinth, lest it might have been said that he had baptized them into his own name (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into such connection with himself as baptism implied with Christ alone. Doubtless in the instruction which preceded baptism this significance of the sacrament would be explained. And if "into Christ," then "into his death." "In Christum, inquam, totum, adeoque in mortem ejus baptizatur" (Bengel). The whole experience of Christ was understood to have its counterpart in those who were baptized into him; in them was understood a death to sin, corresponding to his actual death. This, too, would form part of the instruction of catechumens. St. Paul often presses it as what he conceives to be well understood; and in subsequent verses of this chapter he further explains what he means. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we were buried</span> (not <span class="accented">are</span>, as in the Authorized Version<span class="cmt_word">) with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life</span>. The mention here of burial as well as death does not appear to be meant as a further carrying out of the idea of a fulfilment in us of the whole of Christ's experience, in the sense - As he died and was buried, so we die and are even buried too. Such a conception of burial being in our case a further process subsequent to our death in baptism, is indeed well expressed in our Collect for Easter Eve: but the form of expression, "buried into death," does not suit it here. The reference rather is to the form of baptism, viz. by immersion, which was understood to signify burial, and therefore death. So Chrysostom, on <a href="../../par/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>. The main intention of the verse is to bring out the idea of resurrection following death in our case as in Christ's. The sense, therefore, is - As our burial (or total immersion) in the baptismal water was followed by entire emergence, so our death with Christ to sin, which that immersion symbolized, is to be followed by our resurrection with him to a new life. As to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, through which Christ is here said to have been raised, see what was said under Romans 3:23. "<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> est <span class="accented">gloria</span> divinae vitae, incorruptiblitatis, potentiae, et virtutis, per quam et Christus resuscitatus est, et nos vitae novas restituimur, Deoque conformamur. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, <span class="accented">seqq."</span> (Bengel). In some passages our Lord is regarded as having been raised from the dead in virtue of the Divine life that was in himself, whereby it was impossible that he should be holden of death. (see under Romans 1:4). And he said of his own <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again" (<a href="../../par/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). But . here as most commonly elsewhere, his resurrection is attributed to the operation of the glory of the Father - the same Divine power that regenerates us in him (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; also our Lord's own prayers to the Father previously to his suffering, as given by St. John). The two views are not inconsistent, and may serve to show Christ's oneness with the Father as touching his Godhead. The marked association here and elsewhere of union with Christ, so as to die and rise again with him, with the rite of baptism, supports the orthodox view of that sacrament being not only a <span class="accented">signum significans</span>, but a <span class="accented">signum efficax</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> not only representing, but being "a means whereby we receive" regeneration. The beginning of the new life of believers, with the power as well as the obligation to lead such a life, is ever regarded as dating from their baptism (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is true, however, that in all such passages in the New Testament the baptism of adults is referred to; that is, of persons who at the time of baptism were capable of actual repentance and faith, and hence of actual <span class="accented">moral</span> regeneration, and they are supposed to have understood the significance of the rite, and to have been sincere in seeking it. Hence what is said or implied cannot fairly be pressed as applicable in all respects to infant baptism. This, however, is not the place for discussing the propriety of infant baptism, or the sense in which all baptized persons are regarded by the Church as in their very baptism regenerate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>his</i> resurrection:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection</span>. So the Authorized Version. But the English word "planted" (though the idea expressed by it has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, and other ancient Fathers; also of the Vulgate, and, among moderns, Beza, Luther, and others; while some, including Erasmus, Calvin, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, understand "engrafted") probably suggests what was not intended. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>), and need only express being made to grow together in close association. In classic authors it commonly means <span class="accented">innate.</span> It seems here used, not to introduce a new figure, whether of planting or grafting, but only to express the close union with Christ, already intimated, into which we entered in baptism. The Revised Version has "have become united with him," which may perhaps sufficiently express what is meant, though hardly a satisfactory rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Tyndale and Cranmer translate "graft in deeth lyke unto him;" and perhaps "graft into" may be as good a rendering as any other. Meyer, Tholuck, Alford, and others take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (Tholuck). But it may be better to understand <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: "Graft into Christ, in the likeness of his death," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being added because Christ's death and ours, in the senses intended, are not the same kind of death literally, ours only corresponding to, and in a certain sense like his. The main purpose of this verse, as of ver. 4, is to press <span class="accented">resurrection</span> with Christ as following <span class="accented">death</span> with him. But why here the <span class="accented">future</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>? Did we not rise with Christ to a new life when we emerged from our baptismal burial? Future verbs are used also with a similar reference in ver. 8 and ver. 14. Now, there are three senses in which our resurrection with Christ may be understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As above (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, etc., where the expression is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our realization of our position of power and obligation in subsequent life - actually in practice "dying from sin and rising again unto righteousness" (cf. below, vers. 12-14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The resurrection of the dead hereafter. Some (including Tertullian, Chrysostom, (Ecumenins) have taken sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to be here intended; but, though the words themselves, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8, suggest this sense, it can hardly be intended here, at any rate exclusively or prominently, since the drift of the whole passage is to insist on the necessity of an <span class="accented">ethical</span> resurrection now; and it is evident that the clause before us corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in the previous verse, and to ver. 11, <span class="accented">et seq</span>. The future <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is understood by some as only expressing <span class="accented">consequence -</span> a necessary conclusion from a premiss, thus: If such a thing is the case, such other thing will follow. If so, sense (1) might still be understood; so that the idea would be the same as in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, etc., viz. that of our rising in baptism itself to a new life with Christ, in which sin need not, and ought not to, have dominion. But still the repeated use of the future tense (especially <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 14), together with the whole drift of what follows, seems rather to imply sense (2); that is, our realization of our position in our actual lives subsequent to baptism. If it be objected that in this case we should expect "we ought to be" rather than "we shall be" it may be replied that it is what God will do for us, rather than what we shall do for ourselves, that the apostle has in view. If he has made us partakers in the atoning <span class="accented">death</span> of Christ, having forgiven us all trespasses, etc. (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>), he will also make us partakers, as our life goes on, in the power of his <span class="accented">resurrection too</span>, delivering us from sin's dominion. Further, if this be so, the thought may also include sense (3) For elsewhere the future resurrection seems to be regarded as only the consummation of a spiritual resurrection which is begun in the present life, Christians being already partakers in the eternal life of God, of which the issue is immortality; cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; also our Lord's own words, which are peculiarly significant in this regard, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, <span class="accented">hath</span> everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is <span class="accented">passed from death unto life.</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you. The hour is coming, <span class="accented">and now is</span>, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live" (<a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24, 25</a>). Again, "I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me <span class="accented">shall never die'</span> (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>).

It does not imply anything further (as some have supposed) as to the manner of our own spiritual dying, such as painfulness or lingering; it merely means that in his death our old man died (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>).

In Ephesians and Colossians the old man is said to be <span class="accented">put away</span>, or <span class="accented">put off</span>, and the new one <span class="accented">put on, as</span> though they were two clothings, or investments, of his personality, determining its character. Here, by a bolder figure, they are viewed as an old self that had died and a new one that had come to life in its place (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The idea of a new man being born into a new life in baptism was already familiar to the Jews in their baptism of proselytes (see Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.); and our Lord, discoursing to Nicodemus of the new birth, supposes him to understand the figure; but he teaches him that the change thus expressed should be no mere change of profession and habits of life, but a radical inward change, which could only be wrought by the regenerating Spirit. Such a change St. Paul teaches to be signified by Christian baptism; not only deliverance from condemnation through participation in the benefits of the death of Christ, but also the birth or creation of a new self corresponding to his risen body, which will not be, like the old self, under the thraldom of sin. "The body of sin" may be taken as meaning much the same as "our old man;" sin being conceived as embodied in our former selves, and so possessing them and keeping them in bondage. It certainly does not mean simply our bodies as distinct from our souls, so as to imply the idea that the former must be macerated that the latter may live. The asceticism inculcated elsewhere in the New Testament is in no contradiction to the ideal of <span class="accented">mens sana in corpore sano.</span> Our former sin-possessed and sin-dominated personality being now crucified with Christ, dead, and done away with, we are no longer, in our new personality, in slavery to sin, and are both bound and able to renounce it; "for he that hath died is freed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, literally, 'is justified'] from sin." In Scotland, one who is executed is said to be <span class="accented">justified</span>, the idea apparently being that he has satisfied the claims of law. So here ' <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

When it is implied here that death had once dominion over him, it is not, of course, meant that he was in his own <span class="accented">Divide</span> nature subject to death, or that . 'it was possible that he should be holden of it." All that is implied is that he had made himself subject to it by taking on him our nature, and voluntarily submitted to it, once for all, as representing us (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>).

"Died unto sin" certainly does not mean here, as some have taken it, died <span class="accented">by reason of sin</span>, or <span class="accented">to atone for sin</span>, but has the sense, elsewhere obvious in this chapter, of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, followed by a dative, which was explained under ver. 2. Christ was, indeed, never subject to sin, or himself infected with it, as we are; but he "bore the sins of many;" "the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all." He submitted for us to the condition and penalty of human sin; but, when he died, he threw off its burden, and was done with it for ever (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time <span class="accented">without sin</span> unto salvation"). The purpose of thus describing the permanent life to God of the risen Christ is, of course, to show that the new life of us who are accounted to have risen with Christ must in like manner be permanent and free from sin. "Quo docere vult hanc vitae novitatem tota vila esse Christianis persequendam, Nam si Christi imaginem in se repraesentare debent, hanc perpetuo durare necesse est. Non quod uno momento emoriatur caro in nobis, sicuti nuper diximus: sed quia retrocedere in ea mortificanda non liceat. Si enim in coenum nostrum revolvimur, Christum abnegamus; cujus nisi per vitae novitatem consortes esse non possumus, sicut ipse vitam incorruptibilem agit" (Calvin). The next verse expresses this clearly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord</span>. In the verses which follow (12-14) the apostle exhorts his readers to do their own part in realizing this their union with the risen Christ, to give effect to the regenerating grace of God. For their baptism had been but the beginning of their new life; it depended on themselves whether sanctification should follow on regeneration, as it needs must do in order to salvation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof</span>. (The reading of the Textus Receptus, "obey <span class="accented">it in</span> the lusts thereof," has but weak support.) Though our "old man" is conceived of as crucified with Christ - though this is theoretically and potentially our position - yet our actual lives may be at variance with it; for we are still in our present "mortal body," with its lusts remaining; and sin is still a power, not yet destroyed, which <span class="accented">may</span>, if we let it, have domination over us still. Regeneration is not regarded as having changed our nature, or eradicated all our evil propensions, but as having introduced into us a higher power - "the power of his resurrection" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) - in virtue of which we may resist the attempted domination of sin. But it still rests with us whether we will give our allegiance to sin or to Christ. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Chrysostom). The lusts, obedience to which is equivalent to letting sin reign, are said to be those of our "mortal body," because it is in our present bodily organization that the lusts tempting us to evil rise. But it is not in their soliciting us, but in the will assenting to them, that the sin lies. "Quia non consentimus desideriis pravis in gratia sumus" (Augustine, 'Prop.,' 35). "Cupiditates corporis sunt fomes, peccatum ignis" (Bengel). The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> ("mortal") is fitly used as distinguishing our present perishable framework - the earthen vessels in which we have our treasure (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>) - from our real inward personality, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>), which is regarded as having risen with Christ, so as to live to God for ever. "Vos enim, viventes, abalienati estis a corpore vestro (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>)" (Bengel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">Neither yield ye your members <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness unto God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God</span>. By our <span class="accented">members</span> seem to be meant, not merely the several parts of our bodily frame - eye. tongue, hand, foot, etc. - but generally all the parts or constituents of our present human nature, which sin may use as its instruments, but which ought to be devoted to God (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Many commentators would translate <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> "weapons" rather than "instruments," on the ground that St. Paul usually uses the word in this sense (<a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11, 13</a>); and also that <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 22, taken in the sense of the pay of a soldier (as in <a href="../../par/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>), is supposed to imply that the apostle has had all along the idea of <span class="accented">warfare</span> in view. The second of these reasons really proves nothing. Whatever the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23, it is too far removed from the passage before us to be taken in any connection with it. Neither is the first reason at all cogent. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> bears the sense of <span class="accented">instruments</span> as well as of <span class="accented">weapons</span>, and may more suitably bear it here. When St. Paul elsewhere speaks of armour, it is the armour of <span class="accented">light</span>, or of <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, which we are told to <span class="accented">take up</span>, and to <span class="accented">put on, in</span> order to fight against our spiritual enemies. Such a conception is inapplicable to our own <span class="accented">members</span>, which we have already, which we may use either for good or evil, and which require the protection of heavenly armour rather than being themselves armour; and we certainly could not be told to take them up or put them on. We may, in the next place, observe that the two clauses of this verse are differently expressed in two respects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is our <span class="accented">members</span> only that we are forbidden to yield to sin; but <span class="accented">ourselves</span>, with our members, we are bidden to yield to God. For few of the persons addressed, if even any, could be supposed, deliberately and of choice, to offer their whole being to the service of sin as such; they were only liable to succumb to sin, in this or that way, through soliciting lusts. But the regenerate Christian offers and presents his whole serf to God, and desires to be his entirely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In the first clause we find the present imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but in the second the aorist imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The distinction between the two tenses in the imperative is thus expressed in Matthiae's 'Greek Grammar:' "that the aorist designates an action passing by, and considered abstractedly in its completion, but the present a continued and frequently repeated action." Our giving ourselves to God is something done once for all; our yielding our members as instruments of sin is a succession of acts of yielding. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under law, but under grace</span>. As to the force of the future here, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, see what was said under ver. 5. Here also no more seems, at first sight, to be meant than that God, if we respond to his grace, will not let sin have dominion over us; we shall, in fact, if we are willing, be enabled to resist it. "Invitos nos non coget [peccatum] ad serviendum tibi" (Bengel). And the reason given is suitable to this meaning: "For ye are not under law" (which, while it makes sin sinful and exacts its full penalty, imparts no power to overcome it), "but under grace" (which does communicate such power). Thus understanding the verse, we see the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in ver. 12 and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> here. In ver. 12 we are exhorted not to let sin <span class="accented">reign</span>; we are to own no allegiance to it as a <span class="accented">king</span> whose rule we must obey. But it still will try to usurp lordship over us - in vain, however, if we resist the usurpation: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The sense thus given to the verse is what its own language and the previous context suggest. But ver. 15, which follows, suggests a different meaning. "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?" Such a question could not arise on the statement of the preceding verse, if its meaning were understood to be that grace will enable us to avoid sin; it rather supposes the meaning that grace condones sin. Hence, in ver. 15 at least, a different aspect of the difference between being under law and being under grace seems evidently to come in; namely, this - that the principle of law is to exact complete obedience to its behests; but the principle of grace is to accept faith in lieu of complete obedience. If, then, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 14 is to be understood in agreement with this idea, it must mean, "Sin, though it still infects you, shall not lord it over you so as to bring you into condemnation." Calvin has a good note on the verse. He allows the first of the expositions of it given above to be "una quae caeteris prohabilius sustineri queat." But he thinks that ver. 15, following, requires the other, and he concludes thus: "Vult enim nos consolari apostolus, ne animis fatiscamus in studio bene agendi, propterea quod multas imperfectiones adhuc in nobis sentiamus. Uteunque enim peccati aculeis vexemut, non petest tamen nos subigere, quia Spiritu Dei superiores reddimur: deinde in gratia constituti, sumus liberati a rigida Legis exactione." It may be that the apostle, when he wrote ver. 14, meant what the previous context suggests, but passed on in ver. 15 to the other idea in view of the way in which his words might be understood. In what follows next (vers. 15-23) is introduced the second illustration (see former note), drawn from the human relations between masters and slaves. It comes in by way of meeting the supposed abuse of the statement of ver. 14; but it serves as a further proof of the general position that is being upheld. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 14 suggests this particular illustration. We being under grace, it had been said, sin will not be our master, whence the inference was supposed to be drawn that we may sin with impunity, and without thereby subjecting ourselves to the mastery of sin. Nay, it is replied, but it <span class="accented">will be our</span> master, if in practice we consent to be its servants.

"Ye yield yourselves" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, cf. ver. 13) denotes acts of yielding. "Ye are" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) denotes condition. The meaning is that by our conduct we show which master we are under; and we cannot serve two (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>, "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin;" and <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>, "He that doeth righteousness is righteous"). The two incompatible services are here said to be of sin and of <span class="accented">obedience</span>, with their respective tendencies or results, <span class="accented">death</span> and <span class="accented">righteousness.</span> A more exact antithesis to the first clause would have been "of righteousness unto life;" life being the proper antithesis of death, and righteousness being afterwards said, in vers. 18 and 19, to be what we ought to be in bondage to. But though the sentence seems thus defective in form, its meaning is plain. <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> means here specifically obedience to God, not obedience to any master as in ver. 16; and though in English "servants of obedience," as though <span class="accented">obedience</span> were a master, is an awkward phrase, yet we might properly say, "servants of duty," in opposition to "servants of sin;" and this is what is meant. It may be that the apostle purposely avoided here speaking of believers being <span class="accented">slaves</span> of righteousness in the sense in which they had been slaves of sin, because subjection to righteousness is not properly slavery, but willing obedience. He uses the expression, indeed, afterwards (ver. 18), but adds at once, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, etc. (see note on this last expression). Death, "unto" which the service of sin is here said to be, cannot be mere natural death, to which all are subject. Meyer (with Chrysostom, Theophylact, and other ancients) takes it to mean <span class="accented">eternal</span> death, as the <span class="accented">final</span> result of bondage to sin; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, antithetically correlative, being regarded as applying to the time of final perfection of the faithful in the world to come - "the righteousness which is awarded to them in the <span class="accented">judgment."</span> Seeing, however, that the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is used throughout the Epistle to denote what is attainable in this present life, and that <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is often used to express a state of spiritual death, which men may be in at any time (see additional note on ver. 12; and cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9, 10, 13, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 13</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>), it is at least a question whether the final doom of the last judgment is here at all exclusively in the apostle's view.

There is no contradiction between what is here said and the fear previously implied lest the persons addressed might still serve sin. He refers them back to the time of their baptism, when he conceives them both to have understood their obligation (cf. ver. 3), and also to have been heartily sincere. The fear was lest they might have relaxed since, perhaps through infection with antinomian teaching. By the "form of doctrine" or "of instruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is not at all likely to be meant (as some have supposed) any distinctive <span class="accented">type</span> of Christian teaching, such as the <span class="accented">Pauline</span> (so Meyer). Usually elsewhere, where St. Paul uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is of persons being examples or patterns to others (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>). Somewhat similarly, in <a href="../../par/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>, Adam is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> the things which happened to the Israelites in the wilderness were <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> to us. These are all the instances of the use of the word in St. Paul's Epistles. Here, therefore, it may be best to understand it (so as to retain the idea of pattern) as the general Christian code into which converts had been indoctrinated, regarded as a norton <span class="accented">agendi</span> "Norma ilia et regula, ad quam se conformat servus, tautum ei per doctrinam ostenditur; urgeri eum non opus est" (Bengel on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>).

Here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> ("I speak humanly") may be taken as referring to the expression immediately preceding, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. St. Paul may mean, "In saying you were made <span class="accented">slaves to</span> righteousness, I am using human language not properly applicable to your spiritual relations. For you are not really in bondage now; you have been emancipated from your former bondage to sin, and are now called upon to render a free willing allowance to righteousness; being, in fact, sons, not slaves." This view of the true position of the Christian being one of freedom recurs so often and so forcibly with St. Paul that it is peculiarly likely to be the thought before him here; the very word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> would be likely to suggest it (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). If (he would say) you fully realized your position as sons of God, you would feel it impossible even to think of sinning willingly; but, in accommodation to your human weakness, I put the case as if you had only been transferred from one bondage to another, so as to show that, even so, you are under an <span class="accented">obligation</span> not to sin. According to this view of the meaning of the passage, "the infirmity of your flesh" has reference to dulness of spiritual perception, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> being opposed in a general sense to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Had they been <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, they would have discerned <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> without need of any such human view of the matter being put before them (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). Some, however, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> to denote <span class="accented">moral</span> weakness, which renders the attainment of holiness difficult for man (cf <a href="../../par/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>), understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> as meaning, "I require of you no more than is possible &Ntilde; for your frail humanity; for I call on you only to render to righteousness the same allegiance you once rendered to sin." This interpretation gives a totally different meaning to the clause. It has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Calvin, Estius, Wetstein, and others; but it does not appear so natural or probable as the other, which is accepted by most modern commentators. <span class="cmt_word">For as ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification</span> (rather than <span class="accented">holiness</span>, as in the Authorized Version; the word is <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, always so translated elsewhere). This is a setting forth of what must follow in practice from the view that has been taken of the change in the Christian's position resembling the transference of bondservants from one master to another. They must devote their <span class="accented">members</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> above on ver. 13) to the service of the new master in the same way as they had done to that of the old one; the aims or results of the two services being also intimated. The old service was in giving themselves up to <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (with reference to sins of sensuality), and generally to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. lawlessness</span>, or disregard of duty; and its result is expressed by a repetition of the latter word. For sin leads to nothing positive; lawless conduct only results in a habit or state of lawlessness; whereas the service of righteousness in itself leads to sanctification to the abiding result of participation in the holiness of God. "Qui justitiae serviunt, proficiunt; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, sunt <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, nil amplius" (Bengel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20</a></div><div class="verse">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness</span> (more literally, <span class="accented">to righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye were not in any bondage to righteousness). <span class="cmt_word">What fruit had ye then</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> when you were formerly slaves of sin) <span class="cmt_word">in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?, for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and made servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification; and the end life eternal. For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of god is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord</span>. The logical connection with the previous context of the above series of verses, beginning with ver. 20, as well as the sequence of thought running through them (intimated by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), is not at once obvious. It seems to be as follows: the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> in ver. 20 introduces a reason for the exhortation of ver. 19, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, etc. But ver. 20 is not in itself the reason, being only an introduction to the statement of it in the verses that follow. The drift of the whole passage seems to be this: Yield ye your members to the sole service of righteousness; <span class="accented">for</span> (ver. 20) ye were once in the sole service of sin, owning no allegiance to righteousness at all; <span class="accented">and</span> (ver. 21) what fruit had ye from that service? None at all; for ye know that the only end of the things ye did then, and of which ye are now ashamed, is death. <span class="accented">But</span> (ver. 22) your new service <span class="accented">has</span> its fruit: it leads to your sanctification now, and in the end eternal life. Authorities, however, both ancient and modern, are divided as to the punctuation, and consequent construction, of ver. 21. In the Vulgate and the Authorized Version (as in the interpretation given above) the stop of interrogation is placed after "ashamed;" the answer, <span class="accented">none</span>, being understood, and "for the end," etc., being the reason why there is no fruit The other way is to take the question as ending at "had ye then," and "those things whereof," etc., as the answer to it, and for the end, etc., as the reason why they are ashamed. Thus: "What fruit had ye then (when you were free from righteousness)? The works (or pleasures) of which you are now ashamed were the only fruit; you are ashamed of them now; <span class="accented">for their</span> end is death." The latter interpretation is defended by Alford on the ground that it is more consistent "with the New Testament meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is 'actions,' the ' fruit of the man' considered as the tree, not 'wages' or 'reward,' the 'fruit of his actions.'" This is true. But, on the other hand, it may be argued that such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Paul is always in a good sense; he usually regards <span class="accented">sin</span> as having no fruits at all; to the <span class="accented">fruit</span> of the Spirit is opposed, not any fruit of a different character, but <span class="accented">the works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) of the flesh (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19, 22</a>); and in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a> (again in opposition to the <span class="accented">fruit of the Spirit</span>) he speaks of the <span class="accented">unfruitful</span> works (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> darkness. Thus the idea of ver. 21, understood as in the Authorized Version, seems closely to correspond with that of the passage last cited. "The things of which ye are now ashamed," in ver. 21, are "the works of darkness" of <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>; and in both places they are declared to have no fruit. Sin is a barren tree, and only ends in death. Cf. what was said above with respect to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 19. It is true, however, that the expression in the next chapter, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>), in opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in some degree weakens the force of the above argument. We observe, lastly, on ver. 23, that to the "wages" of sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> , used usually to denote a soldier's pay) is opposed "free gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> for sin earns death as its due reward; but eternal life is not earned by us, but granted us by the grace of God. As to the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in ver. 22, it can be used without the need of any such apology as seems to be implied in ver. 19 (according to the meaning of the verse that has been preferred) for speaking of our becoming <span class="accented">slaves</span> to righteousness. For we do belong to God as his <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and to Christ, having been "bought with a price" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>); and St. Paul at the beginning of his Epistles often calls himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (cf. also <a href="../../par/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). But it does not follow that our service should be the service of slaves; it may be a free, willing, enthusiastic obedience notwithstanding; we obey, not because we are under bondage to obey, but because love inspires us (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>, etc., "Because ye are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

It rests on the recognized principle that <span class="accented">death</span> cancels the claims of human law on a person (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-7.htm">Romans 6:7</a>); and this with especial reference to the law of marriage, as being peculiarly applicable to the subject to be illustrated, since the Church is elsewhere regarded as married to Christ. As has been observed above, it is from <span class="accented">the Law</span> that Christians are now said to be emancipated in the death of Christ; not from <span class="accented">sin, as</span> in the previous sections. Hence this section might at first sight seem to introduce a new line of thought. But it is really a continuation of the same, though differently viewed; for, in the sense intended by St. Paul, being under the Law is equivalent to being under sin. How this is has already more or less appeared; and it will be shown further in the latter part of this chapter. For elucidating the connection of thought between this and the preceding sections, it may be here briefly stated thus: A fundamental axiom with the apostle is that "where no law is, there is no transgression" (<a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; cf. 5:13; 7:9); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without law of some kind (including in the idea both external law and the law of conscience) to reveal to man the difference between right and wrong, he is not held responsible; to be a sinner before God he must know what sin is. Human sin consists in a man doing wrong, knowing it to be wrong; or, at any rate, with an original power and opportunity of knowing it to be so. (This, be it observed, is the idea running through the whole of ch. 1, in which all mankind are convicted of sin; the whole drift of the argument being that they had sinned against knowledge.) Law, then, in making sin known to man, subjects him to its guilt, and consequently to its condemnation. But this is all it does; it is all that, in itself, it can do. It can remove neither the guilt nor the dominion of sin. Its principle is simply to exact entire obedience to its requirements; and there it leaves the sinner. The above view applies to all law, and of course peculiarly to the Mosaic Law (which the writer has all along mainly in view) in proportion to the authority of its source and the strictness of its requirements. Thus it is that St. Paul regards being under the Law as the same thing as being under sin, and dying to the Law as the same thing as dying to sin. Grace, on the other hand, under which we pass in rising again with Christ, does both the things which law cannot do: it both cancels the guilt of sin (repentance and faith presumed), and also imparts power to overcome it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to persons knowing law), how that the Law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so long as <span class="accented">the man</span> liveth; not so long as <span class="accented">the Law</span> liveth in the sense of <span class="accented">viget</span>, or "remains in force," though Origen, Ambrose, Grotius, Erasmus, and others, for reasons that will appear, understood the latter sense. It is not the natural one.

The word expresses the entire abolition of the claim of the husband's law over her) <span class="cmt_word">from the law of the husband. So then if, while the husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the Law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit unto God</span>. The general drift of the above verses is plain enough; namely, that, as in all cases death frees a man from the claims of human law, and, in particular, as death frees the wife from the claims of marital law, so that she may marry again, so the death of Christ, into which we were baptized, frees us from the claims of the law which formerly bound us, so that we may be married spiritually to the risen Saviour, apart from the old dominion of law, and consequently of sin. But it is not so easy to explain the intended analogy in precise terms, there being an apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application with regard to the parties supposed to die. Even before the application there is a seeming discrepance of this kind between the general statement of ver. 1 and the instance given in ver. 2. For in ver. 1 it is (according to the view we have taken of it) the death of the person who had been under law that frees him from it, whereas in ver. 2 it is the death of the husband (representing law) that frees the wife from the law she had been under. Hence the interpretation of ver. 1 above referred to, according to which <span class="accented">law</span>, and not a <span class="accented">man</span>, is the understood nominative to <span class="accented">liveth.</span> But, even if this interpretation were considered tenable, we should not thus get rid of the subsequent apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application. For in the former it is the death of the husband that frees the wife; whereas in the latter it seems to be the death of ourselves, who answer to the wife, in the death of Christ, that frees us. For that it is ourselves that are regarded as having died to the Law with Christ appears not only from other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, in ch. 6.), but also, in the passage before us, from <span class="greek">&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 4, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 6. (The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Textus Receptus rests on no authority, being apparently only a conjecture of Beza's.) There are various ways of explaining. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That (notwithstanding the reasons against the supposition that have just been given) it is the <span class="accented">Law</span>, and not the <span class="accented">man</span>, that is conceived as having died in the death of Christ. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a> may be referred to as supporting this conception. Thus the illustration and the application are made to hang together, the law of the husband being regarded as having died in the husband's death, as <span class="accented">the Law</span> generally to us in Christ's death; and we have already seen how ver. 1 may be forced into correspondence. This view of the Law itself being regarded as having died has the weighty support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Ambrose, and other Greek Fathers. Chrysostom accounts for the apostle introducing a different conception in ver. 4: by suggesting that he avoided saying explicitly that the Law had died, for fear of wounding the Jews: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f6c;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. This explanation hardly commends itself as satisfactory; and besides, in addition to what has been already said, it may be observed that throughout the whole passage there is no phrase to suggest in itself the idea of the <span class="accented">Law's</span> death, but only of <span class="accented">some</span> death which emancipates from law (ver. I being taken in its natural sense, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 4, being accepted as the undoubtedly true reading). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That in the illustration the wife is really supposed to die when the husband dies. The death of either party to the marriage-bond cancels it; and when one dies, the other virtually dies to the law that both were under. Thus the statement of principle in ver. 1, the particular illustration in vers. 2, 3, and the application are made to hang together. Meyer takes this view decidedly, and cites <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, to show that the husband's death may be considered as implying the wife's death also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That there is a discrepance between the illustration and the application, the husband being regarded as dying in the former, and ourselves, who represent the wife, in the latter; but that this is of no consequence; the idea, common to both, of <span class="accented">death</span> abrogating the claims of law being sufficient for the apostle's argument. Death, it may be said, however regarded in the application, is an ideal conception, and not an actual fact with respect to ourselves; and it is immaterial how it is regarded, as long as the idea comes out that through death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ours in the death of Christ, we are freed from the dominion of law. (So, in effect, De Wette, and also Alford.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That the former husband is not the law, but <span class="accented">the lust of sin</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 5); the wife, the <span class="accented">soul</span>; the new husband, <span class="accented">Christ.</span> Augustine, who is the author of this view, puts it thus: "Cum ergo tria sint, <span class="accented">anima</span>, tanquam <span class="accented">mulier</span>; <span class="accented">passiones peccatorum</span> tanquam <span class="accented">vir</span>; et <span class="accented">lex</span> tanquam <span class="accented">lex viri</span>; non ibi peccatis mortuis, tanquam viro mortuo liberari animam dicit, sed ipsam animam mort peccato, et liberari a lege, ut sit alterius viri, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christi, cum mortua fuerit peccato, quod fit, cum adhuc manentibus in nobis desideriis et incitamentis quibusdam ad peccandum, non obedi-mus tamen, nec consentimus, mente servientes legi Dei" (Aug., 'Prop.,' 33). Beza, taking up the view of Augustine, puts it somewhat differently, and more clearly, thus: "There are two marriages. In the first, the <span class="accented">old man</span> is the <span class="accented">wife</span>; <span class="accented">predominating sinful desires</span>, the <span class="accented">husband</span>; <span class="accented">transgressions</span> of every kind, the <span class="accented">offspring.</span> In the second, the <span class="accented">new man</span> is the <span class="accented">wife</span>; <span class="accented">Christ</span>, the <span class="accented">Husband</span>; and the <span class="accented">fruits of the Spirit</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) are the <span class="accented">children."</span> This explanation being still apparently open to the objection that, in the illustration, the wife continues the same, but not so that which corresponds to her in the application, Olshausen explains thus: "In man the old man is distinguished from the new without prejudice to the unity of his personality, which Paul subsequently (ver. 20) signifies by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>. This true personality, the proper self of man, is the wife, who in the natural state appears in marriage with the old man, and, in intercourse with him, generates sins, the end of which is death (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21, 22</a>). But in the death of the mortal Christ this old man is dead with him; and, as the individual man is grafted by faith into Christ. his old man dies, by whose life he was holden under the Law." The commentator on the Epistle in the 'Speaker's Commentary' adopts this explanation, with the remark that "St. Paul's application of the figure is quite clear, if we follow his own guidance." The view rests mainly on, and certainly derives some support from, vers. 5 and 6, if regarded as carrying out the application of the figure. Others, however, in view of the difficulties of the whole passage, may prefer to content themselves with explanation (3), as conveying as precise an idea as may possibly have been even in the apostle's mind when he wrote. Commentators may sometimes go beyond their office in attributing to their author more exactness of thought than his words in themselves imply. It is to be observed that the con-eluding expression in ver. 4, "that we should bring forth fruit unto God," brings us back to the main purport of this whole section, which begins at <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1</a>, viz. the obligation of a holy life on Christians. In vers. 5, 6, which follow, the hindrance to our living such a life "when we were in the flesh," and our power of doing so now, are briefly intimated in preparation for what follows. It does not seem necessary to conclude - as is done by those who adopt interpretation (4) of what precedes - that the illustration of the marriage bond is meant to be kept up in these two verses.

There the apostle intimated that he was but speaking humanly in describing our new allegiance to righteousness as bond-service, such as we had once been under. Here he intimates the true character of our new service by the addition of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These are characteristic and significant expressions. "Spirit" and "letter" are similarly contrasted (<a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). "Spiritum literae opponit, quia antequam ad Dei voluntatem voluntas nostra per Spiritum sanctum formats sit, non habemus in Lege nisi externam literam; quae fraenum quidem externis nostris actionibus injicit, concupiscientiae autem nostrae furorem minime cohibet. Novitatem. vero Spiritui attribuit, quia in locum veteris hominis succedit; ut litera vetus dicitur quae interit per Spiritus regenerationem" (Calvin). Otherwise, with regard to <span class="accented">newness</span> and <span class="accented">old</span>ness, "Vetustatis et novitatis vocabulo Paulus spectat duo testamenta" (Bengel). That the latter idea may have suggested the expressions seems not unlikely from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-18</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). For in both these passages the idea of the verse before us enters, and in both the old and new covenants are contrasted with regard to it. It may be enough here to say that the contrast in its essence is between exacted conformity to an external code (which was the characteristic of the old covenant) and inspired allegiance to the Law of God written on the heart (which is the characteristic of the new).

The apostle, seeing that readers might be perplexed by such identification, now, in the first place, explains what he has meant by it. Is the Law, then, sin? No, replies the apostle; the Law itself (with especial reference to the Mosaic Law as the great and authentic expression of Divine law) is holy; and its connection with sin is only this - that, in virtue of its very holiness, it convinces of sin, and makes it sinful. And then, to the end of ch. 7, he goes on to show how this is by an analysis of the operation of law on human consciousness. He presents to us a vivid picture of a man supposed at first to be without law, and therefore unconscious of sin; but then, through law coming in, acquiring a sense of it, and yet unable to avoid it. The man assents in his conscience to the good, but is dragged down by the infection of his nature to the evil. He seems to have, as it were, two contrary laws within himself, distracting him. And so the external Law, appealing to the higher law within himself, good and holy though it be, is, in a sense, killing him; for it reveals sin to him, and makes it deadly, but does not deliver him from it, till the crisis comes in the desperate cry, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (ver. 24). But this crisis is the precursor of deliverance; it is the last throe preceding the new birth; the Law has now done its work, having fully convinced of sin, and excited the yearning for deliverance, and in "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" the deliverance comes. How it comes is set forth in ch. 8, where the state of peace and hope, consequent on deliverance through faith in Christ, is portrayed in glowing terms, so as thus to complete the subject which we announced as being that of the sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters, viz. "the moral results to believers of the revealed righteousness of God." Two questions have been raised and discussed with regard to vers. 7-25. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Whether St. Paul, who writes throughout the passage in the first person singular, is describing his own personal experience, or only so writing in order to give vividness and reality to his picture of the experience of any human soul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whether he is describing the mental experience of an unregenerate or of a regenerate man. As to (1), his purpose undoubtedly is not (like that of Augustine in his 'Confessions ') to tell us about himself, but to depict generally the throes of the human soul when convinced of sin. But, in doing this, he as undoubtedly draws on his own past experience; recollections of the struggle he had himself gone through gleam evidently throughout the picture; he paints so vividly because he has felt so keenly. This makes the passage so peculiarly interesting, as being not only a striking analysis of human consciousness, but also an opening out to us of the great apostle's inner self; of the inward pangs and dissatisfaction with himself which had, we may well believe, distracted him through the many years when he had been a zealot for the Law and apparently satisfied with it, and when - perhaps partly to stifle disturbing thoughts - he had thrown himself into the work of persecution. Then, further, the sudden change of tone observable in the eighth chapter, which is like calm and sunshine after storm, reveals to us the change that had come over him (to which he often elsewhere refers), when "the light from heaven" had shown him an escape from his mental chaos. He was then "a new creature: old things had passed away; behold, all things had become new" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). As to question (2), an answer has been already virtually given; viz. that the condition described is that of the unregenerate; in this sense - that it is of one still under the bondage of sin and law, before the revelation to the soul of the righteousness of God, and the consequent rising to a new life in Christ. This seems obvious from its being the thought of law subjecting to sin that introduces the whole passage, and runs through it - the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> which connects ver. 14 with what precedes denoting a continuance throughout of the same line of thought - and also from the marked change of tone in ch. 8, where the state of the regenerate is undoubtedly described. Further, we find, in vers. 5 and 6 of ch. 7, the obvious theses of the two sections that follow, in the remainder of ch. 7. and in ch. 8. respectively. Their wording exactly corresponds to the subject-matter of these sections; and ver. 5 distinctly expresses the state of being under law, ver. 6 the state of deliverance from it. Further, particular expressions in the two sections seem to be in intended contrast with each other, so as to denote contrasted states. In <a href="../../par/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9, 11, 13</a>, sin, through the Law, <span class="accented">kills</span>; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a> we have "the law of the Spirit of <span class="accented">life."</span> In <a href="../../par/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> the man is brought into <span class="accented">captivity</span>; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a> he is made <span class="accented">free.</span> In <a href="../../par/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14, 18</a> there is invincible strife between the holy Law and the carnal mind; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a> the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled. In <a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a> we were in the <span class="accented">flesh</span>; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> not in the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, but in the <span class="accented">Spirit.</span> And, further, could St. Paul possibly have spoken of the regenerate Christian as "sold under sin" (ver. 14)? His state is one of redemption from it. We do not mean that the state which begins to be described at ver. 14 is one devoid of grace. A condition of progress towards regeneration is described; and the final utter dissatisfaction with self, and the keen yearning after good, imply a reused and enlightened conscience: it is the state of one who is being prepared for deliverance, and is not far from the kingdom of God. All, in fact, we say is that it is not till ch. 8. that the picture of a soul emancipated by a living faith in Christ begins. We may observe, further, that the mere use of the present tense in ver. 14 and afterwards by no means necessitates our supposing the apostle to be speaking of his own state at the time of writing, and therefore of the state of a regenerate Christian. He uses the present to add vividness and reality to the picture; he throws himself back into, and realizes to himself again, his own former feebleness; and he thus also more clearly distinguishes between the state described and the imagined previous one before law had begun to operate. The view which we thus confidently advocate is that of the Greek Fathers generally, the application of the passage to the regenerate Christian being apparently due to Augustine in his opposition to Pelagianism; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his <span class="accented">later</span> view; for in his earlier days (Prop. 45 in 'Ep. ad Romans;' 'Ad Simplic.,' 1:91, 'Conf.,' 7:21) he had held with the Greek Fathers. Jerome also seems to have similarly changed his mind about it; and the later view of both these Fathers has been adopted by Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Corn. a Lapide, and by Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, and others among the Protestants. What weighed with Augustine was that in vers. 17, 20, 22, more propension to good is implied than his doctrinal theory allowed to the natural man. Under a similar impression, Calvin says, commenting on ver. 17, "Porto hic locus palam evincit non nisi de pits qui jam regeniti sunt Paulum disputare. Quamdiu enim manet homo sui similis, quantus quantus est, merito censetur vitiosus." If, however, St. Paul's intention, obvious from his own writing, does not fit in with Augustinian or Calvinistic theology, so much the worse for the latter. The verses in question do not, in fact, express more than the apostle elsewhere allows man to be capable of, and what observation of fact shows him to be capable of, though not having yet attained to Christian faith; viz. approval of, longing for, and even striving for, what is good. It is not more than the sincere and earnest, even in the Gentile world, have been already credited with in ch. 2. of this Epistle (vers. 7, 10, 14, 15, 26, 29). It does not follow that such moral earnestness is independent of Divine grace; but there is a true and effective operation of Divine grace, suitable to men's needs and capacities, before the fulness of Pentecostal grace. And further, however "far gone from original righteousness" man in his natural state may be, still that utter depravity attributed to him by some theologians is neither consonant with observed fact nor declared in Holy Writ. The image of God in which he was made is represented as defaced, but not obliterated. Be it observed, lastly, with regard to the whole question of the intention of this chapter, that its reference to the unregenerate precludes the wresting of some parts of it to support antinomianism. Calvin, though applying it, as said above, to the regenerate, thus alludes to and guards against any such abuse of ver. 17: "Non est deprecatio so excusantis, ac si culpa vacaret; quomodo multi nugatores justam defensionem habere se putant, qua tegant sua fiagitia dum in carnem ea rejiciunt." It was observed in the note at the head of ch. 2. that, though the thesis to be then proved was the sinfulness of all men without exception before God, this did not seem to be in that chapter rigorously proved with regard to those - and such it was allowed there were - who sincerely sought after righteousness, and refrained from judging others; and it was said that this apparent deficiency in the proof would be supplied in ch. 7. And so it is in this analysis of the inward consciousness of even the best in their natural state; recognizable by all as a true one in proportion to their own moral enlightenment and moral earnestness. This consideration is an additional reason for regarding ch. 7. as referring to the unregenerate; since otherwise a link in the argument on which the whole treatise rests would seem to be wanting. We may remark also, before proceeding with our exposition, that, though we hold ch. 7. to refer to the unregenerate, and ch. 8. to the regenerate state, between which a sharp line is here drawn, yet it need not follow that either the sense of having passed at a definite time from one to the other as represented in this ideal picture, or the consciousness of entire blessedness as portrayed in ch. 8, will be realized by all, who may still be regenerate and have undergone a true conversion. Owing to the weakness of the human will, which has to work with grace, and to the infection of nature that remains in the regenerate, the triumph of the grace of the new birth is seldom, in fact, complete; and so even saints may often be still painfully conscious of the conflict described in ch. 7. They will, indeed, have the peace and assurance of ch. 8. in proportion as "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" <span class="accented">is</span> potent and paramount in them; but still they may not attain all at once to the ideal of their regenerate condition. Similarly, in St. John's Epistles the kingdoms of darkness and of light are set forth as totally distinct, and the regenerate are regarded as having passed entirely from the one into the other, so as to have the perfect love which casteth out fear; and it is of importance that the essential distinction between the two kingdoms should be kept in view. But still in actual life, as we cannot but feel, the majority of believing Christians have not so passed entirely; clouds from the old kingdom of darkness still partially overshadow most of those who, in the main, have passed into the light, and it may be difficult for us to determine to which kingdom some belong. Such would be the case even with those whom the apostle addressed - persons who had consciously, in adult life, risen to a new life in baptism; and still more will it be so with us, who were baptized in infancy, and may have grown up more or less, but few entirely, under the influence of the regenerating Spirit. Further, it is to be observed that, though the peace and confidence of ch. 8. be the growing result and reward of a true conversion, yet the practical tests of one are ever said by both St. Paul and St. John not to be feelings only, but the fruits of the Spirit in character and life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then?</span> (St. Paul's usual phrase, with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> following, for meeting and rejecting a possible misunderstanding of his meaning; cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Is the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known Bin, but through law</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>, translated "nay," being thus taken, as in the Authorized Version, adversatively to the supposition of the Law being sin, and so a continuation of what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. So far from the Law being sin, it exposes sin. Or it may be in the sense of "howbeit," as in the Revised Version, meaning - still, law has to do with sin so far as this, that it brings it out. <span class="cmt_word">For I had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt not lust</span>, so as to retain the correspondence of the verb with the preceding substantive. Observe, here as elsewhere, the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with and without the article. In the preceding section it was the Mosaic Law that wad specially in view, and it is the idea of being sin that is so indignantly repudiated at the beginning of this verse. So also, at the end, the Law of Moses is referred to as forbidding lust. Hence the article in both cases. But in the intervening phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it is the principle of law generally that is regarding as making sin known. The adducing of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as being made known by the Law seems to have a significance beyond that of its being one particular instance of sin being so made known. It may imply that the very propension to evil, which is the root of sin, is thus only made known as sinful. The reference is, of course, to the tenth commandment. Without it men might not have been aware of the sinfulness of desires as well as of deeds, and thus, after all, been unacquainted with the essence of sin. Further, we may suppose it to be not without a purpose that the apostle varies his verbs expressive of knowing, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> majus est, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> minus. Hinc posterius, cure etiam minor gradus negatur, est in increments" (Bengel). <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may express personal acquaintance with the working and power of sin; <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, no more than knowing lust as being sin at all. If so, it does not in itself imply (whatever may seem to be the case in ver. 8, of which below) that the Law <span class="accented">excites</span> lust, in the sense that I should not have lusted as I do had not the Law forbidden me to lust. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <i>was</i> dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But sin, taking occasion, through the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence</span> (or, <span class="accented">of lust</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for without</span> (or, <span class="accented">apart from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">law sin is dead</span>. Here, as in <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>., sin is personified as a power, antagonistic to the Law of God, that has been introduced into the world of man, causing death. In ch. 5. its first introduction was found in the scriptural account of Adam's transgression. It has ever since been in the world, as is evidenced by the continuance of the reign of death as it comes to all men now (vers. 13, 14). But it is only when men, through law, know it to be sin, that it is imputed (ver. 13), and so slays them spiritually. Apart from law, it is as it were dead with respect to its power over the soul to kill. It is regarded here as an enemy on the watch, seizing its occasion to kill which is offered it when law comes in. It may be observed here that, though it is not easy to define exactly in all cases what St. Paul means by <span class="accented">death</span>, it is evident that he means in this place more than the <span class="accented">physical</span> death which seemed, at first sight at least, to be exclusively referred to in ch. 5. For <span class="accented">all</span> die in the latter sense of the word; but only those who sin with knowledge of law in the sense intended here (see also note on Romans 5:12). It is supposed by most commentators that the expression <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in this verse means, not only that "the commandment" brought out lust <span class="accented">as sin</span>, but further that it <span class="accented">provoked</span> it, according to the alleged tendency of human nature to long all the more for what is forbidden; <span class="accented">Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata.</span> Whether or not we have this tendency to the extent sometimes supposed, the <span class="accented">context</span> certainly neither requires nor suggests the conception, either here or in vers. 5 and 7. It is true, however, that the <span class="accented">language</span> of vers. 5 and 8 does in itself suggest it. Against it is the reason which follows; "for without law sin is dead," which can hardly mean (as the strong word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> would seem in such case to require) that lust itself is altogether dormant until prohibition excites it. Calvin interprets <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> thus: "Detexit in me omnem concupiscentiam; quae, dum lateret, quo-dammodo nulla esse videbatur;" and on <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> remarks, "Clarissime exprimit quem sensum habeant superiora. Perinde enim est ac si diceret, sepnltam esse sine Legs peccati <span class="accented">notitiam."</span>

And the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death, For sin, taking occasion, through the commandment deceived me, and through it slew me</span>. If, in saying, "I was alive once," the writer is at all remembering his own experience, the reference may be to the time of the innocence of childhood, before he had any distinct consciousness of the behests of law. Or it may be that he is only imagining a possible state without any consciousness of law, so as to bring out more forcibly the operation of law. On the general drift of ver. 9, Calvin says tersely, "Mors peccati vita est hominis: rursum vita peccati mors hominis." In ver. 11 the conception of sin's action is the same as in ver. 8; but the verb now used is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, with obvious reference to Eve's temptation, which is regarded as representing ours (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). The view of the origin of human sin presented to us in Genesis is that man at first <span class="accented">lived</span> at peace with God; but that <span class="accented">the command</span>ment," Thou shalt not eat of it, lest thou die," was taken advantage of by the "serpent" (answering to personified <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the passage before us), inspiring sinful <span class="accented">lust</span>; and that so the <span class="accented">commandment</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">law</span>), though in itself holy, became the occasion of <span class="accented">sin</span>, and of <span class="accented">death</span> as its consequence; and further, that all this came about through <span class="accented">delusion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). The thing desired was not really good for man; but the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> inspired by the tempter caused it to seem so. One great purpose of regenerating grace is to dispel this delusion; to bring us back to the true view of things as they are, and so to peace with God. Thus, in part, does the apostle teach us to regard the inscrutable mystery of sin, and the remedy for it in Christ.

The question of ver. 7, "Is the Law sin?" has now been answered so far as this - that, far from being so, the commandment was in itself "unto life" (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>), only that sin took occasion by it, and so got power to slay.

No, it is replied; away with the thought! Its effect was only to reveal sin in its true light; it was only an Ithuriel's spear ('Par. Lost,' bk. 4.),bringing out and exposing the deadly thing that before was latent. And (as is elsewhere set forth in pursuance of the line of thought) its effect in the end was really "unto life;" for its awakening of the sense of sin, and of a craving for redemption from it, was the necessary preparation for such redemption (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>).

Without lingering to mention varying suggestions of various commentators as to the sense in which the Law is here called <span class="accented">spiritual</span>, we may offer the following considerations in elucidation. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> are, as is well known, constantly contrasted in the New Testament.

When St. Paul in one place distinguishes the constituent elements of human nature, he speaks of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). There <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> seems to denote the animal life or soul animating the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> for the purposes of mere human life, but distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which associates him with the Divine life. Usually, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> alone are spoken of; so that the term <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> seems to include the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, expressing our whole weak human nature now, apart from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which connects us with God (see <a href="../../par/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>, etc.). That in this and other passages <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> does not mean our mere bodily organization only, is further evident from sins not due to mere bodily lusts - such as want of affection, hatred, envy, pride - being called "works of the flesh" (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>). What, then, is meant by the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>? Applied to man, it is, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>, opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/jude/1-19.htm">Jude 1:19</a>); the latter word apparently meaning one in whom the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> (as above understood), and not the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, dominates. Further, St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) speaks of a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning by the former a tenement fitted for and adequate to the mere <span class="accented">psychic</span> life, and by the latter a new organism adapted for the higher life of the <span class="accented">spirit</span>, such as we hope to have hereafter; and in the same passage he uses the neuters, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, with reference to "the first Adam," who was made, or became (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and "the last Adam," who was made <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, generally, denotes the <span class="accented">Divine</span>, which man apprehends and aspires to, nay, in which he has himself a part in virtue of the original breathing into him of the breath of life (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) directly from God (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>), whereby he became a living soul (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) for the purposes of his mundane life (itself above that of the brutes), but retained also a share of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> connecting him with God,and capable of being quickened so as to be the dominant principle of his being through contact with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>. It would seem that the Law is here called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as belonging to the Divine sphere of things, and expressive of the Divine order. "The Law, both the moral law in the bosom of man, and the expression of that law in the Decalogue, is, as Augustine profoundly expresses it, a revelation of the higher order of things founded in the being of God. It is hence a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Tholuck). But man (t<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), though still able to admire, nay, to delight in and aspire to, this higher order, cannot yet conform himself to it because of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, infected with sin, which at present enthrals him: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus is fitly introduced the analysis of human consciousness with reference to law which follows. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (which, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, is the best-supported reading) may be used to express merely our present constitution &Ntilde; our being <span class="accented">of flesh -</span> so as to account for our inability, rather than our being <span class="accented">fleshly</span>, or carnally minded, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> would imply. In two other passages (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-16.htm">Hebrews 7:16</a>) authority is also in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> as in the Textus Receptus. Tholuck, however, doubts whether there was, in common usage, a distinction between the meaning of the two forms. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> significant. It denotes, not our having been originally slaves (<span class="accented">vernae</span>), but our having been sold into slavery (<span class="accented">capri</span>). Slavery to sin is not the rightful condition of our nature. We are as the Israelites in Egypt, or as the captives in Babylon who remembered Zion. Hence the possibility of deliverance, if we feel the burden of our slavery and long to be free, when the Deliverer comes.

The following additional comments may further explain the part of it which begins at ver. 15. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The initial <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> introduces proof of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being in the condition spoken of in the preceding clause, viz. "sold under sin." For (the meaning is) am I not a bond-slave, when, as I feel is the case with me, I am not my own master? But, observe, the state that goes on to be described is that of an unwilling bond-slave; not of one who likes his bondage, and has no desire to be free. The conscience is supposed already, through the operation of law, to protest against sin; to hate its thraldom; not willingly to acquiesce in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The distinction between the verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not observed in the English Version, but to which attention has been drawn in the above translation, has its meaning. Attention to the places where they occur will show their appropriateness in each case, denoting severally single acts, habitual practice, and general working, performance, or accomplishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The English Version is wrong in rendering, in ver. 15, "What I would, that I do not," so as to make the idea the same as that in ver. 19. There are really two different statements in the two verses - the first, of our doing what we wish not to do; the second, of our not doing what we wish to do; and after each the same conclusion is drawn in the same words, viz. that sin is the real worker (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> being here the word appropriately used). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The conflicting principles, or energies, of human nature, between which the individual <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, which wills and acts, is here regarded as being distracted, are the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> in which sin dwells (which has been explained above; see note under ver. 14) on the one hand, and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 23) of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 22) on the other. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is identified with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rather than regarded as an intermediate personality between the two. For it is spoken of throughout as willing what is good; and,. though in ver. 14 it is said to be <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and though, in ver. 18, good dwells not in it, yet the first of these expressions only means that it is in the flesh at present, and therefore in bondage; and the latter is at once qualified by the addition, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; it does not identify the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. It is, we may remark in passing, this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - that is regarded as rising to a new life with Christ, so as to become a <span class="accented">new man</span>, delivered from bondage; this last expression, of course, involving a different idea from that of the <span class="accented">inward man</span>). It is to be observed, further, that throughout this section beginning at ver. 7, there is no distinction drawn (as elsewhere by St. Paul) between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>; the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, in fact, does not come in at all, except with regard to the Law, which is called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The reason is that the apostle is confining himself here to an examination of what man, even at his best, is in his mere human nature; of what thoughtful observers, though not theologians, may perceive him to be. It is a philosophical rather than a theological analysis. It is one that might commend itself to heathen philosophers, some of whom have, in fact, expressed themselves much to the same effect. Hence it is not till ch. 8, where man's regeneration by the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is portrayed, that the spiritual principle in himself, through which he is capable of such regeneration, comes into view. And it will be seen that it is this very idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> that pervades that whole chapter. This essential distinction between the two chapters is sufficient in itself to disprove the theory that the regenerate state is described in ch. 7. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The senses in which the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this chapter require to be perceived and distinguished, its usual sense (see under Romans 2:13) not being uniformly retained. There is, however, always some appended expression to indicate any new application of the word. We find it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in its usual sense, with the usual significance of the absence or the presence of the article, in vers. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16; and in ver. 22, still in the same sense, we have "the Law of God." We find also, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in ver. 23, "the law of my mind," whereby I delight in the "Law of God." Here "law" assumes a different sense from the other, but one in which the word is often used; as when we speak of the laws of nature, having in view, not so much a fiat external to nature which nature must obey, as the uniform rule according to which nature is found to work. The Latin word <span class="accented">norma</span> expresses the idea. Thus "the law of my mind" means the normal constitution of my higher and better self, whereby it cannot but assent to "the Law of God. Then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> we have "the law of sin in my members;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in a similar sense, an antagonistic rule or constitution dominant in my <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. Lastly, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> in ver. 21, the general law (in like sense) of my complex human nature, which necessitates this antagonism: "the law, <span class="accented">that</span> when I would do good" (in accordance with the law of the mind), "evil is present with me" (in virtue of the other law). Ancient and other commentators have been much puzzled as to the meaning of ver. 21, from taking <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning to denote the Mosaic Law, as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> usually does when preceded by the article. But not so when there is something after it to denote a different meaning; as there is here in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> at the end of the verse, meaning <span class="accented">that</span>, not (as some have understood it) <span class="accented">because.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Difficulty has been found in the concluding clause of ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, etc. It follows the expression of thanksgiving, "Thanks be to God," etc., which certainly introduced the thought of deliverance from the state that had been described; and hence it is supposed by some that this clause must be a continuance of that thought, and so to be taken as an introduction to ch. 8. rather than a summing up of the preceding argument. It is said also, in support of this view, that more entire association of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the Law of God than was before intimated is here expressed; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being written instead of simply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> being a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 22). Thus the meaning would be, "Though in my flesh I still serve the law of sin (the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> still remains in me, notwithstanding my regeneration), yet now <span class="accented">in my very real self</span> I not only <span class="accented">approve</span>, but <span class="accented">am in subjection to</span>, the Law of God." It is, however, at least a question whether these slight differences of expression come to much; and both the introductory <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> and the form of the clause suggest rather its being the summarized result of ch. 7. The additional emphasis added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> (which had, indeed, already been emphatic), and the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, may serve only to bring out all the more strongly in the end what it had been the purpose of the whole passage to lead up to, viz. that man's real self, when conscience is fully aroused, yearns for and is ready for redemption. There is no difficulty in so understanding the clause (as we should surely understand it naturally but for the preceding thanksgiving), if we regard the thanksgiving as a parenthetical exclamation, anticipating for a moment the purport of ch. 8. Such an exclamation is characteristic of St. Paul, and it adds life to the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free</span> (not <span class="accented">hath made me</span>; the aorist refers to the time when the Christian became possessed of the Spirit of life in Christ) from the law of sin and death. Here is a distinct contrast to the state described in vers. 14, 23 of ch. 7, and a realization of what was yearned for in ver. 24, "the law of sin and of death" being evidently "the law of sin in the members" previously spoken cf. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, before in captivity to this law, is now freed from it. And how? Not by its becoming a different <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>; not by a change of the constituent elements of human nature; but by the introduction of a new law - the law of the Spirit of life - which has emancipated the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> from its old unwelcome thraldom. In virtue of this new law, introduced into my being, I am now free to give my entire allegiance to the law of God. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, be it observed, is here again used in a sense different from its usual one, and we thus have a still further <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in addition to those defined in the note after <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>. The designation of this new law is in marked opposition to that in which the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> was before said to be held; we have <span class="accented">life</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">death</span>, and the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in opposition to the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as well as <span class="accented">freedom</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">captivity.</span> The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is, in fact, the Divine Spirit, taking possession of what is <span class="accented">spiritual</span> (now at length brought into view) in the <span class="accented">inward man</span>, making him partaker in the Divine <span class="accented">life</span>, and able to serve God <span class="accented">freely.</span> The expressions used bring out strikingly one essential distinction between Law and Gospel, viz. that the principle of the former is to control and discipline conduct by requirements and threats; but of the latter to introduce into man's inner being a new principle of life, whence right conduct may spontaneously flow. Coercion is the principle of the one; inspiration of the other. An illustration may be found in the treatment of disease - on the one hand by attempted repression of specific ailments, and on the other by imparting a new vitality to the system, which may of itself dispel disease. It is shown next how this new state of freedom has been brought about. First, by what God in Christ has done for us apart from ourselves; the subjective condition in ourselves being introduced at the end of ver. 4, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what the Law could not do</span> (this is certainly what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</span> The Law could not deliver from the domination of sin; it was weak for such a purpose (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18, 19</a>) but this not through any defect in itself but as having to work through our sinful flesh which refused obedience. And it was not the office of law to regenerate; it could only command and threaten. Hence the deliverance came, and could only come, from God himself (and this in accordance with the grand idea of the whole Epistle, expressed by the phrase, "the righteousness of God"); and so he sent <span class="accented">his own</span> Son (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Son essentially - in a sense in which none of us can be called sons, himself Divine. The whole drift of the passage, as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, requires this conception); and he sent him into the very sphere of things that required redemption, that by actual participation in it he might personally redeem it; for he sent him in likeness of our "flesh of sin." It is not said <span class="accented">in flesh of sin</span>; for that might imply sin in Christ's individual humanity: but, on the other hand, "in likeness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) does not imply docetism, as though Christ's humanity were not real; for stress is evidently laid on the fact that it was in our actual human flesh that he "condemned" sin.

But in what sense are we to understand <span class="accented">condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>) sin? We observe first that the verb appears to be suggested by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1, the connection being that formerly sin condemned us, but now sin itself has been condemned; that is (as Meyer expresses it), deposed from its rule in the flesh - "jure sue dejectum" (Calvin). (Perhaps similarly, <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.) One view of the force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span> (found in Origen, and taken by Erasmus and others), that it denotes the <span class="accented">punishment</span> of sin endured by Christ vicariously on the cross, is not only not obvious, but inconsistent also with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> preceding; for what the Law could not do, was not to punish sin, but to deliver from it. Nor is there, further, anything in the language used to confine the condemnation of sin, in whatever sense intended, to the atonement made for it on the cross itself. It was in the whole mission of the Saviour (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) that sin was "condemned;" and the idea may include his triumph over it in his human life no less than the penalty paid for it on the cross in behalf of man. "In the flesh" (connected with <span class="accented">condemned</span>, not with <span class="accented">sin</span>) does not mean Christ's own flesh, but human nature generally. He represented man, having become for our sake the Soul of man; and we share his triumph over <span class="accented">sin</span>, made in our very human flesh, when we are baptized into his death, and become thereupon partakers of his resurrection. This idea, ever present to St. Paul's mind, is expressed in the next verse, where our own appropriation of the condemnation of sin in Christ is declared.

This, then, is the purpose of Christ's victory over sin - that the requirement of the Law in us too may be fulfilled; which evidently means more -than that his victory may be <span class="accented">imputed to</span> us, on the ground of our faith only, while we remain as we were. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, and also the condition appended at the end of the verse, imply that the "Spirit of life" must so dominate over the flesh in ourselves that the Law may forfeit its claims over us. The sinful propensions of the flesh remain in us still (as the verses that follow distinctly show); but the Spirit that is in us is strong enough to overcome them now (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-18</a>). It does not follow from this that any Christians will actually avoid all sin, or that they can be accepted <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">ground of</span> their own performance: to say this would be to contradict other Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>); and Paul confessed himself to be not already perfected (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). But perfection, through Christ who lives in them, is put before us as, at any rate, the aim of the regenerate (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>); and by actual and progressive holiness they are to show that their union with Christ is real. His Spirit within them must, at any rate, give a new direction and tone to their characters and lives.

Observe, too, how persistently and continually the apostle presses his protest against antinomian abuse of the doctrine of grace, with which he began this section of his Epistle, at ch. 6:1, He never loses sight of it; it pervades the whole. If St. Paul, especially in this Epistle, is, on the one hand, the great exponent of the doctrine of justification by faith only, he is, on the other, no less the persistent preacher of the necessity of works. Sanctification is continually pressed as the necessary result, as well as evidence, of justification. He only shuts out human works from the office of justifying.

These verses have been variously understood. It has been supposed by some that ver. 10 continues the thought of ver. 9; "the body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) meaning the same as "the flesh (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>),and dead (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) meaning <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. mortified</span>, or lifeless with respect to the power of sin that was in it (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus the meaning of the first clause of ver. 10 would be, "If Christ be in you, the body of sin in you is dead; but you are alive in the Spirit." Decisive objections to this view are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by itself is not elsewhere used as an equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, but as denoting our mere <span class="accented">bodily</span> organization. This statement is consistent with the metaphorical application of the word sometimes in a different verse, as in <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, above quoted, and in <a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>. Observe also <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11, which can hardly be taken but as expressing what is intended here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) cannot be forced out of its proper meaning of "<span class="accented">because</span> of," which, according to the view we are considering, would be unintelligible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that ver. 11, which is obviously connected in thought with ver. 10, cannot well be brought into tune with it according to the view proposed. All is made clear, in view both of language and of context, by taking these two verses as introducing a new thought, which is carried out afterwards in ver. 18, viz. that of the drawback to the full enjoyment and development of our spiritual life owing to the mortal bodies which clothe us now and the purpose is to bid us believe in the reality of our redemption, and persevere in correspondent life, notwithstanding such present drawback. Thus the idea is that, though in our present earthly state the mortal body is death-stricken in consequence of sin (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - subject to the doom of Adam, that extended to all his race (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc.) - yet, Christ being in us now, the same Divine Spirit that raised him from the dead will in us too at last overcome mortality. cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the same word as in ver. 11 here); and compare also all that follows in that chapter. This view of the meaning of the passage before us is strongly confirmed by our finding, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-5:6</a>, exactly the same idea carried out at length, with a correspondence also of the language used. The frail, mortal, ever-dying earthen vessels, in which we have now the treasure of our life in Christ, are there regarded as crippling the expansion of our spiritual life, and causing us to "groan, being burdened" (cf. in the chapter before us, ver. 23, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); but the very consciousness of this higher life within him, yearning so for an adequate and deathless organism, assures the apostle that God has one in store for him, having already given him "the earnest of the Spirit." And this seems to be what is meant hereby "shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." As to particular expressions in the verses before us, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, applied to "the <span class="accented">body</span>," may be taken to mean <span class="accented">infected with death, and doomed to it</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a> - <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, given as the reason for the Spirit being life, may be explained with reference to the essential conception of <span class="accented">righteousness</span> throughout the Epistle, as God's <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, revealed in Christ, and made over to man as the remedy of human sin. Before carrying out the thought peculiarly suggested by the last two verses (as is done at ver. 18), the apostle now draws a conclusion (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) from what has been so far said, so as to press the more the obligation of a spiritual <span class="accented">life</span> in Christians.

The general idea may be stated thus: If ye live after the flesh, the power in you to which you give your allegiance and adhesion will involve you in its own doom, death; but if ye live after the Spirit, you identify yourselves with the Spirit of life that is in you, whereby you will be emancipated at last even from these your mortal bodies, whose doings you already slay.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, wherein we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him</span>. In ver. 14 is introduced a further ground for the assertion in ver. 13, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>; viz. the felt <span class="accented">sonship</span> to God of those who have so received his Spirit as <span class="accented">t</span>o be <span class="accented">led</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> practically actuated) by it. We say "felt" because, though in this verse the sonship is alleged as a fact, yet, in the following verses (15,16) the inward experience of true Christians is appealed to as evidence of such sonship. Then, in ver. 17, the thought is carried out, that <span class="accented">sonship</span> implies <span class="accented">inheritance</span>, and hence a share in the glorified eternal life of Christ. (This conclusion makes further evident what was meant to be implied above in the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>.) "When, after your conversion," the apostle would say, "ye received the Spirit, it did not inspire you with the fear of slaves, but with filial love and trust. And this you know also is the feeling that we give vent to in the congregation, when we cry out [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, denoting emotional utterance], Abba, Father." This last expression is given by St. Mark as our Lord's own in the garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:36). We may conclude that the Aramaic word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;</span> was the one used by him, and heard by St. Peter, who is said to have been St. Mark's informant in the composition of his Gospel; the equivalent Greek word, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, having been added originally by the evangelist in explanation (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a> and Mark 7:34 for similar instances of St. Mark giving Christ's own expressions, with their Greek equivalents). Afterwards it may be further supposed that the Greek-speaking Christians came to use the whole phrase, as it had been delivered to them, in their own devotions, as representing our Lord's own mode of addressing the Father, and so as expressing peculiarly their union with Christ, and their filial relation to God in him. It is probable also, from the way St. Paul here introduces the expression (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, changing from the second to the first person plural), that it was in customary use, perhaps at some special parts of the service, in congregational worship. It occurs once more in a passage closely corresponding with the one before us, and which should be studied in connection with it (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). It is to be observed how, in ver. 17, the idea of our sonship now, and consequently of our being <span class="accented">joint-heirs</span> with Christ, leads up to a resumption of the now prevailing thought of our present condition in the mortal body being no bar to our final inheritance of life. It is our being as yet in these mortal bodies that is the cause of our present suffering; but he also was in the body, and he also so suffered; and our sharing in his sufferings really unites us the more to him, and the more ensures our final inheritance with him (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The apostle introduces next a deep and suggestive view, both in explanation of our now being subject to suffering, and in confirmation of our expectation of future glory notwithstanding. He points to nature generally, to God's whole creation, so far as it is under our view in this mundane sphere, as being at present "subject to vanity," and, as it were, groaning under some power of evil, which is at variance with our ideal of what it should be, and from which there is a general and instinctive yearning for deliverance. Our present sufferings - all those drawbacks to the full enjoyment of our spiritual life - are due to our being at present in the body, and so forming part of the present system of things. But that general yearning is in itself significant of a deliverance; and so the sympathetic witness of nature confirms the hope of our higher spiritual yearnings, and encourages us to endure and wait. Such is the general drift of the passage, continued to the end of ver. 25. Particular thoughts and expressions will be noticed in the course of it.

The word properly means <span class="accented">actus creationis</span>, and is so used in ch. 1:20; but usually in the New Testament denotes what has been created, as, in English, <span class="accented">creation.</span> Sometimes, where the context limits its application, it denotes <span class="accented">mankind</span>, as <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; or it may be used for an individual creature (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Where there is nothing to limit its meaning, it must be understood of the whole visible creation, at any rate in the world of man. Thus in <a href="../../par/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. And so here, except so far as the context limits it; for see especially <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 22. It is, indeed, apparently so limited to the part of creation of which we have cognizance at present; for see <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 22, which denotes a known fact. But is there any further limitation, as many commentators contend? Putting aside as untenable, in view of the whole context (see especially ver. 23), the view of those who understand the new spiritual creation of the regenerate to be meant, we may remark as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> includes certainly all <span class="accented">mankind</span>, not excepting the regenerate. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> in ver. 23 means that "we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit" are included, not that we are a class apart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">whole</span> <span class="accented">animal creation</span> is included too. So general a term as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> could not surely have been used if man only had been meant. And it is obviously true that the whole sentient creation, as well as man, has a share now in the general suffering. To the objection that the irrational creatures cannot be conceived as sharing in the "hope" and "earnest expectation" spoken of, it may be replied that, so far as it seems to be implied that they do, it may only be that the apostle, by a fine <span class="accented">prosopopeia</span>, conceives them as feeling even as the human mind feels concerning them. But, further, conscious hope and expectation does not seem, if the language of the passage be examined, to be distinctly attributed to them. All that is of necessity implied is that they share in the groaning from which we crave deliverance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Inanimate nature too <span class="accented">may be</span> included in the idea, it also seeming to share in the present mystery of evil, and falling short of our ideal of a terrestrial paradise. Tholuck appositely quotes Philo as saying that all nature <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be that St. Paul had in his mind what is said in Genesis of the cursing of the ground for man's sake, and of the thorns and thistles; and also the pictures found in the prophets of a renovated earth, in which the desert should rejoice and blossom as the rose. Calvin comments on the whole passage thus: "Omissa expesitionum varietate, hunc locum accipio, nullum esse elementum, nullamque mundi pattern, quae non, veluti praesontis miseriae agnitione tacta, in spem resurrectionis intenta sit." Again, "Spem creaturis quae sensu carent ideo tribuit, ut fideles oculos aperiant ad conspectum invisibilis vitae, quamvis adhuc sub deformi habitu lateat."

The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> ("was subjected") seems to imply that the present "vanity" and "bondage of corruption" were not inherent in the original Creation, or of necessity to last for ever. Thus the assertions of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: and 31, stand unshaken, viz. that in the beginning God created all things, and that all at first was "very good." The ideas, resorted to in order to account for existing evil, of matter (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) being essentially evil, and of a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, other than the Supreme God, having made the world, are alike precluded. It might serve as an answer to the argument of Lucretius against a Divine origin of things- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nequaquam nobis divinius esse paratam<br />Naturam rerum, tanta star praedita culpa"</span> Why the "creature" was thus "subjected" is not here explained.

All that is, or could be, said is that it was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, meaning God. It was his will that it should be so; this is all we know; except that we find the beginning of evil, so far as it affects man, attributed in Scripture to human sin. But he so subjected his creation <span class="accented">in hope.</span> This expression may refer to the <span class="accented">protoevangelium</span> of <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, or to the never-dying hope in the human heart; to either or to both. The latter idea is expressed in the myth of Pandora's box. Further, the creature is said to have been so subjected "not willingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). No sentient beings acquiesce in suffering; they resent evil, and would fain flee from it. Man especially unwillingly submits to his present bondage. When in ver. 21 the hope is expressed of the creature (or creation) itself being eventually freed from the present bondage of corruption, it may be that the human part of creation only is in the writer's eye; but it may be also (there being still no expressed limitation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) that he conceives a final emancipation of the whole creation from evil (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). But if so, it is not said that the peculiar glory of the sons of God will extend to all creation, but only that all will be freed into the freedom of their glory; which may mean that the day of the revelation of the sons of God in glory will bring with it a general emancipation of all creation from its present bondage. Such a great final hope finds expression in the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />One God, one law, one element,<br />And one far-off Divine event,<br />To which the whole creation moves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">In Memoriam.'</span>) The present condition of things is in ver. 20 denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and in ver. 21 by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first of these words is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew XXX, which means properly "breath," or "vapour," and is used metaphorically for anything frail, fruitless, evanescent, vain. It is often applied to idols, and it is the word in Ecclesiastes where it is said that "all is vanity" (cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5, 6</a>). It seems here to denote the frailty, incompleteness, transitoriness, to which all things are now subject.

The present unwilling subjection of the whole visible creation to evil is here still more forcibly expressed, and spoken of as being what is known - a subject of experience to all who observe and think; and it is added that this state of things continues still - it is "until now." The yearned-for deliverance has not yet come; and therefore we should not be surprised if we too, the regenerate, while in the body, are not yet exempt from our share in the universal groaning.

Its being said that we still wait for our adoption as sons is not inconsistent with other statements (as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5-7</a>, and above, ver. 14, etc.), to the effect that we are already adopted, and are already sons; for <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here denotes the final realization of our present sonship, when the sons of' God shall be <span class="accented">revealed</span> (ver. 19).

Here, then, is a further source of help and comfort to Christians under present trials. Of themselves they know not what relief to crave. St. Paul himself knew not what to pray for as he ought, when he asked for removal of his thorn in the flesh; if left to themselves, their long waiting and their manifold perplexities might damp their hope; but a Helper beyond themselves comes in to succour them, viz. the Holy Spirit himself, who intercedes (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) for them. But how? Not as the Son intercedes for them, apart from themselves, at the mercy-seat; but within themselves, by inspiring them with these unutterable (or, <span class="accented">unuttered</span>) groanings; and they are conscious that such deep and intense yearnings are from the Divine Spirit moving them, and teaching them to pray. They may not still be able to put their requests of God into definite form, or even express them in words; but they know that God knows the meaning of what his own Spirit has inspired. This is a deep and pregnant thought. Even apart from the peculiar faith and inspiration of the gospel, the internal consciousness of the human soul, with its yearnings after something as yet unrealized, affords one of the most cogent evidences of a life to come to those who feel such yearnings. For ideals seem to postulate corresponding realities; instinctive longings seem to postulate fulfilment. Else were human nature a strange riddle indeed. But Christian faith vivifies the ideal, and intensifies the longing; and thus the prophecy of internal consciousness acquires a new force to the Christian believer; and this all the more from his being convinced that the quickening of spiritual life of which he is conscious is Divine. The psalmist of old, when he sang, "As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God," felt in these ardent though inarticulate pantings a presage of fulfilment of his "hope in God." So the devout Christian; and all the more in proportion to the intenseness and definiteness of his yearnings, and his conviction that they are from God.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a></div><div class="verse">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <i>to be</i> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. And whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified</span>. Thus is introduced the doctrine of predestination. This is indeed a principal passage on which theological theories with regard to it have been built. It, with the context, is the basis of the definition of predestination in Art. 17. It is, therefore, of great importance to consider carefully what the apostle here really says, and appears most obviously to mean; it being the duty of the expositor to pay regard to this only, in view of the language used, the way it is introduced, and any cognate passages that may throw light upon it. We may observe, in the first place, that it is plain that more is spoken of here than <span class="accented">national</span> election, or predestination to a state of privilege, which is the subject especially treated in ch. 9. <span class="accented">Individual</span> predestination is in view; and this not to gospel privileges only, but also carrying with it the result of glory. But it still remains to be seen whether such predestination is regarded as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">absolute, i.e.</span> irrespective, with regard to its final result, of the <span class="accented">condition</span> of man's use of grace given; and, if so, whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">arbitrary, i.e.</span> irrespective of the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be, and themselves deserve. The Calvinistic view is that God from all eternity, of the mere good pleasure of his will, selected certain persons out of mankind to be the heirs of glory; the Arminian is that he foresaw from all eternity who would, in the exercise of their own free-will, respond to his purpose, and, in virtue of such foreknowledge, preordained them to glory. It is hardly necessary to consider whether there is any countenance given to the view that predestination ensures salvation, however a man may live; the obligation of actual holiness in Christians being (as we have seen) so strongly insisted on all along. If, then, the Calvinistic theory should appear to be supported, it must be with the proviso that predestination of necessity carries with it the grace of <span class="accented">perseverance</span> in good works, or at any rate a true conversion before the end, as well as final glory. Let us, in the first place, observe the way in which St. Paul introduces the subject, so as better to understand his drift. He has been speaking of the trials and imperfections of the present life, and urging his readers not to be discouraged by them, on the ground that, if they continue to "live after the Spirit," these things will by no means hinder, but rather further, the final issue. To strengthen this position he introduces the thought of God's eternal purpose; in effect thus: Your being in the state of grace in which you now feel yourselves to be, is due to God's eternal purpose to call you to this state, and thus in the end to save you. It is impossible that the circumstances in which he places you now, or any power whatever, should thwart God's eternal purpose. But it is not of necessity implied by anything that is actually said that the persons addressed might not themselves resist the Divine purpose. In fact, their own perseverance appears to be presupposed already, and they have been urged to it all along, as though their use of grace depended on themselves. Hence the apostle in this passage does not really touch the theoretic questions that have been raised by theologians, his purpose being simply the practical one of encouraging his readers to persevere and hope. We may now examine the successive expressions in the passage, and see what they imply. In ver. 28 the context shows <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to have especial reference to external circumstances of trial, and not at all to men's own sins. Calvin, commenting on it, quotes St. Augustine as saying, "Peceata quoque sua, ordinante Dei providentia, sanctis ideo non nocere ut potius corum saluti inserviant;" but while he assents to this proposition, he denies, with truth, that any such meaning is intended here. It may be observed, in passing, that Augustine's proposition, though it sounds strange, may, in a certain sense, be accepted as true: "We must continually err in order to be humble; our frailty and sins are the tools that God uses" (General Gordon's 'Letters to his Sister,' p. 371). Further, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, as though among those that love God only some are "the called;" nor can <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, as though even of the called not all are called with the purpose of saving them. Only a preconceived idea could surely have suggested such an interpretation of the verse. In ver. 29 (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> bearing the sense of "to determine," as well as of "to know") <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> may possibly mean "predetermined" rather than "foreknew." Elsewhere in the New Testament, when used of men, it has the latter sense (<a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>). When used of God, it may, as here, have either meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>); but in the text last referred to the first meaning seems more probable. So also of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>. The distinction would not be of much importance but for the fact that the sense of "foreknew" has been pressed in support of the Arminian view; viz. that Divine predestination was consequent on the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be. It would not, indeed, really prove this view, since it might only mean that God knew beforehand the objects of his intended mercy. Calvin, though translating <span class="accented">praecognovit</span>, strongly rebuts the Arminian inference, saying, "Insulsi colligunt illi, quos dixi, Deum non alios elegisse nisi quos sua gratia dignos fore praevidit." Again, "Sequitur notitiam hanc a bene placito pendere, quia Deus nihil extra seipsum praeseivit quos voluit adoptando, sod tantum signavit quos eligere volebat.' <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (which might, perhaps, be better rendered <span class="accented">preordained</span>, which is its proper meaning, so as to avoid the necessary idea of irresistible destiny which is commonly associated with the word <span class="accented">predestinate</span>) must be taken, not absolutely, but in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. That the elect should in the first place be "conformed to the image of Christ" is all that is, here at least, denoted as preordained by God. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, may be understood, from the preceding context, to refer, primarily at least, to participation in Christ's sufferings (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Coming to ver. 30, we find the following sequence: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> eternal foreknowledge (or eternal purpose), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> preordination to fellowship with Christ, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> calling (to acceptance of the gospel), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> justification, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> glorification.  <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (4) means the participation in God's <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, the passing into a "state of salvation" through faith in baptism. But what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (5) has been a subject of discussion. Some, in view of the aorist, not future, tense of the verb, understand it of <span class="accented">sanctification</span> subsequent to <span class="accented">justification</span>, regarded as participation in the <span class="accented">glory</span> of the Divine holiness. Others, in view of the significance of the word itself, understand future glory, the aorist being accounted, for by the apostle's taking in one view the whole process of salvation with its final result, which is contemplated as accomplished. Perhaps both ideas are included, present sanctification being regarded as the commencement and earnest of the full glory to be revealed in "the sons of God" hereafter. In any case, we are not bound by what is here said to conclude that final glory of necessity follows the previous stages. For the apostle may be only setting forth the process and result when grace is not resisted. But certainly he implies that, when the result is glory, all is to be traced, not to man's initiation or deservings, but to Divine grace, and the Divine purpose of mercy from eternity. In the remainder of this chapter the apostle rises into a strain of glowing eloquence, into a very song of triumph, in view of the assured hope of faithful Christians. Faithfulness, be it once more observed, is presupposed throughout the passage, which is quite wrongly understood as encouraging confidence in any on the ground of their conviction that they are certainly, even in spite of themselves, predestinated to glory: it only encourages perseverance in spite of trial on the ground of our feeling that, if we do persevere, we cannot fail, because God is on our side, and it is his eternal purpose to save us.

Many may be <span class="accented">called</span> to a state of salvation, but not all of them <span class="accented">chosen</span> finally, as fulfilling the purpose of their calling.) It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. A different punctuation of these two verses is preferred by some, and seems more natural and more forcible; thus: Who <span class="accented">shall charge God's elect? God who justifieth? Who is he that condemneth? Christ who died?</span> etc. A similar answering a question by asking another is found below in ver. 35. The further thought is thus implied that, if neither God charges, nor Christ, the Judge, condemns, who can do either? The apostle next goes on to say that, there being none to charge and condemn us at last, so also there is none that can <span class="accented">remove</span> us from our state of acceptance now. For who or what can possibly prove stronger than Christ's love, which has called us to it? The enumeration that follows of things that might possibly be supposed to remove us shows again that it is not our own sins, but external circumstances of trial, that are being viewed all along as powerless to hinder our salvation.

Divine omnipotence combined with omniscience on the one hand, and human free-will on the other, seem indeed to human reason to be incompatible ideas; yet we are compelled to entertain both - the one on the ground, not only of scriptural teaching, but also of our conception of the Divine Being; the other on the ground, not only of our conception of Divine justice, but also of our own irresistible consciousness, and of scriptural teaching too. Such difficulty of reconciliation between two apparently necessary ideas is not peculiar to theology; philosophy has it too; and there are necessitarians among philosophers, as well as predestinarians among theologians, equally contradicting man's irresistible consciousness of having the power of choice. We can only regard the conflicting conceptions as partial apprehensions of a great truth which as a whole is beyond us. The apparent contradiction between them may be due to the failure of finite beings to comprehend infinity. They have been compared to two parallel straight lines, which, according to geometrical definition, can never meet, and yet, according to the higher mathematical theory, meet in infinity; or we may take the illustration of an asymptote, which from a finite point of view can never possibly touch a curve, and yet, in analytical geometry, is found to cross it at an infinite distance. For the practical purposes of life both ideas may be entertained; and it is only human attempts to reconcile them in theory, or to escape the difficulty by denying free-will altogether, that have given rise to the endless controversies on the subject. It is important to observe how St. Paul, though he distinctly intimates both conceptions (as he must needs do as a preacher of God's truth in all its aspects), and though his allusions to predestination have been made a main support of Calvinistic views, never really propounds a theory. When he alludes to the subject, it is with a practical purpose; and when (as in this chapter) he speaks of God's predestination of believers to glory, his purpose is to encourage them to persevere in holiness on the ground of their assurance of God's eternal purpose concerning them, the essential human conditions being all along supposed to be fulfilled (see also note on Hebrews 6:16-20, in 'Pulpit Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

But it was a subject too deeply fixed in St. Paul's mind to be left unnoticed. And besides, what he had said at the beginning of his treatise, and afterwards implied, seemed to call for some explanation in the face of existing facts. For he had said (<a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), that the gospel "was the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; <span class="accented">to the Jew first</span>, and also to the Gentile;" and throughout he has regarded it as the fulfilment of the peculiar promises made to the Jews themselves, who were to have precedence, though not monopoly, in the inheritance of its blessings. How, then, was this view consistent with the fact that the Jews in general, even more than any others, were now <span class="accented">excluded</span> from this inheritance? The apostle has already, even in the course of his argument, paused to meet certain supposed difficulties of this kind in the short section, <a href="../../par/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-8</a>; but now he takes up the whole subject formally, and considers it in all its bearings. First, in ch. 9, he expresses his deep sorrow for the fact; but shows it to be not inconsistent either with God's faithfulness to his promise, or with his justice, or with the Word of prophecy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost</span>. For similar solemn asseverations by St. Paul of the truth of what was known to himself alone, cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>. The peculiar solemnity of this may be due to the peculiar depth of his feelings on the subject. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to suppose him to be moved by a fear of his patriotic enthusiasm being doubted, now that he had turned Christian, and argued so strongly against Jewish monopoly of privilege But it may have been so. For the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; ch. 12:19; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>. It is not an adjuration, but denotes the element in which he moves and speaks. Similarly, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> following (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>), which, of course, could not be on oath.

He does not say what for, leaving it to appear in what follows. The broken sentence is significant of emotion. <span class="cmt_word">For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh</span>. None of the ways that have been suggested for evading the obvious meaning of this assertion are tenable. One such way is to take the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> as expressing what he once wished, viz. before his conversion; so that the meaning would be, "My interest in my own people is such that, in my zeal for them, I once myself desired to be entirely apart from Christ; I myself said, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>), and persecuted his followers." Neither the natural force of the imperfect here (as to which cf. <a href="../../par/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-20.htm">Galatians 4:20</a>), nor that of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, nor the context, allow this subterfuge. Another way is to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as implying only devotion to temporal destruction, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to a violent death. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, every animal devoted to the Lord (in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is surely to be put to death; and this has been conceived as all that is implied here. So Jerome, 'Quaest. 9, ad Algas.,' and Hilary, 'Ad <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.' But how then about <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>? The words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, both denote primarily what is offered or set apart; the latter being applied to things devoted to God's honour and service (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a>), the latter always in the New Testament used to denote rejection or devotion to evil. It occurs in <a href="../../par/acts/23-14.htm">Acts 23:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>. It certainly means here separation from the communion of Christ, in the same sense as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>). Even if the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> be understood as meaning in itself excommunication only (as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in ecclesiastical usage), the addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently implies more than mere separation from outward Church communion. The apostle can hardly mean otherwise than that he would forfeit his own communion with Christ on behalf of (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>) his countrymen, if so they as a nation could be brought to accept the gospel. This certainly was a strong thing to say, and it may seem to us to imply an impossibility, if we compare it, for instance, with <a href="../../par/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>, "I am persuaded<span class="accented"></span>," etc. But we need not understand a passing expression of feeling, however real, as a deliberate utterance. The imperfect <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> implies only that the fact had passed through his mind in the intensity of his desire for the salvation of his brethren. It corresponds with the saying of Moses under the like strong emotion, "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin -; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which thou hast written" (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>). Bengel remarks well," Ex summa fide (cap. 8) nunc summum ostendit amorem, ex amore divine accensum. Res non poterat fieri, quam optarat: sed votum erat pium et solidum, quamlibet cum tacita conditione, <span class="accented">si fieri posset."</span> Also, "De mensura amoris in Mose et Paulo non facile est existimare. Eum enim modulus ratiocinationum nostrarum non capit; sieur heroum bellicorum animos non capit parvulus." St. Paul proceeds, in the spirit of a patriotic Jew, which he ever retained, to enumerate the peculiar privileges of the chosen people, their possession of which rendered their present failure to realize their purpose so peculiarly disappointing and distressing.

Amen.</span> Here "the adoption" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) means the selection of Israel to be God's peculiar people (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn;" <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, "Ye are the children of the Lord your God;" <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt;" also <a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>.

It is, of course, a different idea from that of the spiritual <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of believers (at present as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, or to come as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), though it might be typical of it. "The glory" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) seems best explained by reference to <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-18</a>, where the visible glory, said to have rested on the mercy-seat and to have illuminated for a time the face of Moses, is regarded as expressing the glory, in a higher sense, of the old dispensation, which, however, was destined to fade away in the greater glory of the revelation of God in Christ. The word may be thus taken to denote, not simply the <span class="accented">Sheehinab</span>, or the glory on Mount Sinai, but rather what was signified by these manifestations. It was probably a recognized term in use with reference to the giving of the Law. "The covenants" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and "the promises" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), both in the plural, include those made with and given to Abraham and the other patriarchs, as well as the Mosaic ones. The former word is wrongly taken by some as denoting the <span class="accented">tables</span> of the covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is obviously the divinely appointed ceremonial worship, the typical significance of which is explained at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the same word is used. "The fathers" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) are the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the original recipients of the promises, descent from whom was made such account of by the Jews, as being the foundation of their privileges (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; and, for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this sense, cf. <a href="../../par/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The last and crowning distinction of the Jewish race is mentioned last, viz. the fleshly descent therefrom of Christ, even of him who in his higher nature is "over all, God blessed for ever." This is certainly the most obvious meaning of the conclusion of ver. 5, as far as the language is concerned, and the one understood by all ancient commentators. Some moderns, however, as is well known, have raised objections to this interpretation of the clause, based solely on the supposed improbability that St. Paul would have so designated Christ. Some would, therefore, get over this imagined difficulty by putting a full stop after <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, and taking what follows as a doxology to God the Father, thus: "God, who is over all, be blessed for ever." The apostle is supposed, according to this interpretation, to have been moved to this parenthetical utterance by his contemplation of the Divine favours to Israel, which he had been recounting. Some have suggested the full stop being put after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>  to Christ, and take only what follows as a doxology, or, as some would have it, as a statement. But, in either case, the idea of so unlikely a breaking up of the sentence may be dismissed as untenable. Others, without thus breaking up the sentence, take the whole of it, beginning with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, to be, not a doxology, but a statement, thus at- tempting to meet the objection to its being a doxology (to be noticed presently), arising from the collocation of the words. But a mere assertion that God <span class="accented">is</span> blessed for ever would seem peculiarly uncalled for and purposeless here. Meyer, being a critic of deserved repute, and an upholder of the modern interpretation of the clause, taking the whole of it together as a doxology to the Father, it may suffice to state his arguments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That St. Paul, though regarding the Son of God as the image of God, of the essence of God, the agent in creation and preservation, the judge of all, the object of prayer, and the possessor of Divine glory and fulness of grace (<a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>; Philippians it. 6; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; Colossians 2:9; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), never expressly calls him <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but always clearly distinguishes him as the <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; and that the passages in which <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> has been supposed by some to apply to him (as in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>) are wrongly so understood; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, being also undoubtedly the original reading in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>.

Meyer adds in a note, "<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> certainly refers to Christ; but this is just one of the traces of post-apostolic composition. Now, to these arguments it may be replied as follows: To (1) that, though it may be true that St. Paul in no other passage expressly calls Christ <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, yet his doctrine with respect to his Divine nature is in accordance with the expression; for surely the term <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applicable to him who is spoken of, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; that his usual distinction between the supreme God and Christ as Mediator by no means precludes his declaring in express terms Christ's essential Deity in a passage where such a declaration is suitable and called for; that even St. John, who is acknowledged by all to have peculiarly set forth the Divine essence of Christ, only once uses the expression, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or any exactly equivalent to it. To argument (2) it may be replied that the language used does <span class="accented">not</span> identify Christ with the Father as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, especially if we suppose a comma after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so that the meaning would he, "Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever." That Christ is "over all" is what is distinctly declared elsewhere by St. Paul, and <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., may be appended predicatively to denote his Divine essence. As to argument (3), it is necessary to exclude not only 2 Peter and Hebrews, but also 2 Timothy from the list of apostolical writings in order to give it any force. But even so it would be irrelevant; for the sentence before us is not a doxology, but an assertion: it is, according to the ancient interpretation, not "Blessed <span class="accented">be</span> Christ as God for ever;" but" Christ, who is God blessed for ever." The positive reasons for retaining the ancient interpretations may be stated as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Not one of the Greek or other Fathers, or any interpreter before Erasmus, is known to have understood it otherwise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It gives the most obvious sense of the words themselves. It may well be contended that no other would have been thought of, but for the supposed discrepance with the apostle's usual way of speaking of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Whereas a doxology to God the Father does not seem called for here, or to have any very obvious bearing on the writer's train of thought, some assertion of the Divine greatness of Christ seems wanted to complete the representation of the final and crowning privilege of the race of Israel. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would indeed suffice for this purpose, if it could be dissevered from what follows. But, as has been said above, it is not allowable so to break up the sentence. Cf also <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, where the statement that Christ had been born of the seed of David, <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>, is followed by an assertion also of his Divine Sonship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the sentence had been intended as a doxology, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ought properly to have preceded <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>, where the same expression occurs); whereas in every other passage where <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> follows the subject of the sentence, it is an assertion, and not a doxology (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The whole objection to the ancient interpretation rests solely on the views of modern critics as to what they think St. Paul was <span class="accented">likely</span> to mean - not on what his language most obviously intimates that he <span class="accented">did</span> mean - a very unsafe principle of interpretation. Our safe conclusion seems to be that modern criticism has not made out a sufficient case for departing from the unanimous ancient interpretation of this passage.

For they <i>are</i> not all Israel, which are of Israel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - (2) (<span class="accented">a</span>) After this avowal of his deep sorrow, and his reasons for feeling it, the apostle now proceeds to deal with the subject. First (as has been said above) he shows (vers. 6-13) that the present exclusion of the great majority of the Jews from Christian privileges does not imply any <span class="accented">unfaithfulness</span> on God's part to his ancient promises; and thus it follows that the fact of their exclusion is no proof of the gospel not being the true fulfilment of those promises. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it is not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect</span> (or, <span class="accented">hath come to naught</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For they are not all Israel who are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called</span>. The promises to the patriarchs never, from the first, implied the inheritance of them by all the physical descendants of those patriarchs; even in Israel there is a recognized distinction between being of the race of Israel and being the true Israel of God; in the original promise to Abraham the descendants of Ishmael (though equally with those of Isaac, his physical seed) were excluded. And so even the race of Israel is but a part of the whole seed of Abraham, to whom the promise was made. Hence it follows that the present exclusion of the majority of even the race of Israel from the inheritance of the promises is not inconsistent with the original purport of those promises. The quotation from <a href="../../par/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, "In Isaac," etc., is properly (as in the original Hebrew) "In Isaac shall a seed be named to thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "In Isaac it shall come to pass that posterity of thine shall have the name and position of <span class="accented">the seed of Abraham</span>, and be recognized as the inheritors of the promise" (Meyer).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for seed. For the word of promise is this, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>). In other words, it is not in virtue of mere carnal descent, but of the promise, that any are so counted; mere carnal descent establishes no claim. It is to be observed that in the first recorded promises to Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) there was no restriction; and so through Ishmael, who is also called Abraham's seed (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13</a>), as well as through Isaac, the fulfilment might have been. But the subsequent promise (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10, 14</a>) limited it to Isaac; which limiting promise is, therefore, in ver. 9, referred to. With <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in ver. 8 Compare <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 4), and also <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>. The apostle may have been led to use the expression here in view of the spiritual sonship to God of Christians (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, etc.)which was typified and prepared for by the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen seed. A still further limitation of "the children of the promise" is next referred to; and one still more telling for the apostle's argument. It might be said that Ishmael was not, even carnally, the true seed, as being born, not of the wife, but of the bondwoman; or perhaps that he had forfeited any claim he might have had by his proved unworthiness (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, etc.). But Esau and Jacob were twin children, not only of the same patriarch (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fbe;&#x1fef;&#x3c2;</span>), but also of the same wedded wife; and yet one was chosen and the other rejected, and this even before birth; so that, as the selection was not due to carnal descent, so neither could it be due to proved desert. Thus by this second consideration is disposed of the Jew's assertion of an indefeasible claim to inheritance of the promises on the ground of his boasted works, as by the other is disposed of his claim on the ground of his race. St. Paul's argument to the Jews of his own day would be - You cannot set up a claim to be all of you the necessary inheritors of the promises for all time on the ground either of your carnal descent or of your works, since the selection of Israel himself did not depend on either of these grounds; nor can you say that my position (viz. that Christian believers, to the exclusion of most of you, are now the true inheritors of the promises) implies unfaithfulness in God to his ancient promises; for it is in accordance with the principle on which, according to your own Scriptures, he fulfilled of old his promises to the patriarchs. St. Paul, however, is not to be understood here as writing with a direct polemical intention, but rather as discussing a problem which had at one time perplexed himself, and which seemed to him to call for solution.

It is here to be carefully observed that, though Jacob and Esau were individuals, yet it is not as such, but as the progenitors and representatives of races, that they are here spoken cf. So it was, too, in both the passages quoted from the Old Testament. In <a href="../../par/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> the words are, "Two <span class="accented">nations</span> are in thy womb, and two <span class="accented">manner of people</span> shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one <span class="accented">people</span> shall be stronger than the other <span class="accented">people</span>; and the elder shall serve the younger." In <a href="../../par/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a> the prophet's entire drift is to set forth the Divine favour shown, from the first and still, to the race of Israel as compared with the race of Edom. Hence, as well as from the purport of the chapter as announced at its beginning, it is evident that the subject <span class="accented">of individual</span> predestination does not really come in, as it did in ch. 8, but only that of nations or races of men to a position of privilege as inheritors of promises. It will be seen, also, as we go on, that the introduction in illustration of the case of the individual Pharaoh does not really affect the drift of the chapter as above explained. The strong expression, "Esau I hated" (applicable, as shown above, not to the individual Esau, but to the race of Edom) is capable of being explained as meaning, "I excluded him from the love I showed to Israel." The evidence of such alleged hatred the prophet expresses thus: "and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness;" whereas Israel, it is implied, had been protected from such desolation. As to the necessary force of the word in the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>), we may compare <a href="../../par/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30, 31</a>, where in ver. 30 it is said that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, and in ver. 31, as meaning the same thing, that Leah was hated; and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15</a>, "If a man have two wives, one beloved and another hated." In both these passages the same verb is used as in Malachi, and need not, in either case, mean more than disregarding one in comparison with another who is loved. For the use, in the New Testament, of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in a sense for the expression of which our English "to hate," in its usual acceptation, is evidently too strong, cf. <a href="../../par/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a> (to be compared with <a href="../../par/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>) and <a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>; so also, though not so distinctly, <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>. It is, moreover, not improbable that the Prophet Malachi, in his patriotic ardour, had in his mind the idea of wrath against the race of Edom on the part of the LORD, as "the people," as he afterwards says, "against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever." But even so, the glowing language of prophets need not be taken as dogmatic assertion; and certainly not as binding us to believe that any race of men is, in the literal sense of the expression, hated of Cod. Such a view is in evident contradiction to the general teaching of Scripture, and notably so to that of St. Paul, who has so emphatically declared that God "made of one blood all nations of men," and is One to all.

These premisses assumed, the apostle reasons thus: "What I have said of God's way of dealing with men does not imply unrighteousness in him; for it agrees with what he said of himself to Moses." The quotation is from <a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>. Moses had besought the LORD to show him his glory, as a token that he and the people had found grace in his sight (vers. 16, 18). The LORD, in answer to his prayer, makes "all his goodness pass before him," in token that such grace had been found; but declares, in the words quoted, that all such grace accorded was not due to any claim on the part of man, but to his own good pleasure. In the verses that follow (17, 18) it is further shown, by the same kind of argument, that, as God declares himself to accept whom he will, so he also declares himself to reject whom he will; and hence, as his power is absolute, so is his justice unimpeachable, in himself determining the objects of his reprobation no less than the objects of his mercy. This appears from what he is recorded (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>) to have said through Moses to Pharaoh.

The conclusion follows: <span class="cmt_word">So then he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth</span>. The passage quoted in ver. 17, taken (as it is intended to be) in conjunction with the whole history as given in Exodus - and especially with the passages in which God himself is said to have hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go - shows that not only the deliverance of Israel, but also the obduration of Pharaoh, was due to the determination of God that it should be so, in accordance with his own righteous purpose, which cannot be called in question by man. The particular declaration of <a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> appears to be selected for quotation because of its relevancy to the case in hand, which it is intended to illustrate; viz. the present rejection of the majority of the Jews from gospel privileges. How this is will appear below. Now, this whole passage has been used in support of Calvinistic views of the original absolute reprobation of individuals irrespectively of their deserts. Calvin himself draws this conclusion from it, very decidedly, thus: "Neque enim praevideri ruinam impiorum a Domino Paulus tradit, sed ejus consilio et voluntate ordinari; quemadmodum et Solomon docet (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>) non mode praecognitum fuisse impiorum interitum, sed impios ipsos fuisse destinato creates, ut perirent" ('In Epist. Pauli ad Romans,' on <a href="../../par/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>). It is, therefore, important to consider carefully both the original meaning of the verse, quoted from Exodus, and the apostle's application of it. First, with reference to Pharaoh himself, what is meant by "I raised thee up (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)"? Not "created thee;" nor (as in the Vulgate, and as Augustine, Calvin, and some others interpret) <span class="accented">excitavi te, i.e.</span> "stirred thee up" to resist my will, that I might exhibit my power in confounding thee. Whether or not St. Paul's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> would bear this sense, it is quite inadmissible in the LXX. (from which, in this expression, he varies), and also in the Hebrew, of which the proper rendering is, "I made thee to stand." The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning that Pharaoh had been kept alive instead of being at once cut off, that God's power might be displayed in him. (The idea thus expressed, it may be observed, accords closely with that of ver. 22 below, where the case of Pharaoh is still in view; "endured with much long-suffering," etc. Thus, though the rendering <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> may be incorrect, and varied by St. Paul, yet he still seems to recognize the idea which it expresses.) St. Paul's rendering, which is closer to the Hebrew than the LXX., seems to mean, "raised thee to thy present position of power and greatness" (or possibly, as Meyer explains, "caused thee to emerge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in history: "Thy whole historical appearance has been brought about by me, in order that," etc.). Thus the expression cannot mean, either that God had brought Pharaoh originally into existence for the sole purpose of destroying him, or that he had from the first irresistibly incited him to obduracy in order to condemn him, and so destroy him. The Lord says in effect to him, "Thou art now great and powerful; but it is! that made thee so, or still keep thee so: and this, not that thou mayest accomplish thine own will, but subserve mine, and that my power to work out my own purposes of mercy or of judgment may be the more notably displayed." For how is God's purpose in so raising Pharaoh up defined? "That I might show in thee my power, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as is evident from the history, by the deliverance of Israel in spite of Pharaoh's opposition through the judgments sent on him and his people to that end. There is plainly nothing in the original history to imply Pharaoh's individual reprobation with regard to his own eternal salvation, but only his discomfiture in his opposition to the Divine purpose of mercy to Israel. But still, with a view to such execution of his purposes, God himself is said to have hardened Pharaoh's heart; and it is to this that the apostle draws special attention in conclusion, as denoting that which it is his design to show. It is thus certainly declared that this hardening was from God. But even so, it is nowhere said that God had made Pharaoh's heart hard from the first, so that he had been all along incapable of acting otherwise than he did. The inference rather is that, after wilful resistance to appeals, final obduracy was sent on him as a judgment. And it is further to be observed that in some verses in Exodus (Exodus 8:15, 19, 32; 9:34) Pharaoh is said to have hardened his own heart, with the addition, in <a href="../../par/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>, of "he sinned yet more;" while in others (<a href="../../par/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/9-7.htm">Exodus 9:7, 35</a>) it is only said generally that "his heart was hardened." The two forms of expression seem to denote two aspects of final obduracy in man - according to one as being self-induced, according to the other as judicial. Thus also in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>. the Lord himself is said to have sent the lying spirit into the heart of Ahab's prophets, in order that he might rush to his ruin, though it was obviously due to his own sins that he was thus finally doomed. A striking instance of the two aspects of human obduracy is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc., and the reference to the passage by our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>. In Isaiah it is, "Make the heart of this people fat," etc.; but in our Lord's reference, "For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes <span class="accented">have they</span> closed;" as if the closing had been their own doing (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>). The following lines express a like conception of judicial blindness- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"For when we in our viciousness grow hard (O misery on't!),<br />the wise gods seal our eyes,<br />In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us<br />Adore our errors, laugh at us while we strut<br />To our confusion."</span> We may compare also the Latin saying, <span class="foreign">Quem Deus vult, perdere prius dementat</span>, which by no means implies that the divinely dementated persons have not deserved destruction. Such, then, seems the view to be taken of what is said about Pharaoh himself. But the important thing to be kept in view for a proper understanding of the drift of the passage is that, though Pharaoh was himself an individual, his case is adduced in no connection with the question of individual predestination, but in illustration of the principle on which nations, or races of men, are elected to or rejected from the enjoyment of Divine favour. This is the real subject of the whole chapter; and hence to build on this part of it a doctrine of individual election or reprobation is to bring into it what is not there. The drift of the passage before us is this: Moses and the Israelites of old illustrate the position of the faithful remnant of the Jews together with all Christian believers now. Pharaoh illustrates the position of the obdurate majority of the Jewish nation now. As he, in setting himself against the Divine purpose, and relying on his own strength, was unable to thwart God's design of mercy to his chosen, and was himself hardened and rejected, so the Jews as a nation now. And as then, so now, both the election and the rejection are to be referred entirely to the will of God, having mercy on whom he will and hardening whom he will, his justice in doing both being nevertheless unimpeachable.

For who resisteth his will?</span> Having shown that <span class="accented">injustice</span> cannot be imputed to God in hardening as well as having mercy on whom he will, the apostle now meets the supposed difficulty of understanding why men should be held <span class="accented">guilty</span> before God for but being as he wills them to be. It is immediately suggested by Pharaoh's case, which led to the conclusion, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; but the apostle foresees that an objection might be raised on this ground to his finding fault with the Jews for rejecting Christ, and them he especially has in view in what follows. It may be observed here that there is undoubtedly a difficulty to the human mind in reconciling theoretically Divine omnipotence with human free-will and responsibility. (On the general question, see notes on ch. 8.) St. Paul here, after his manner, does not attempt to solve the general problem, confining himself for the present to the Divine side of it. His answer, in vers. 20, 21, is simply to the effect that God has the absolute right as well as power to deal with his own creation as he pleases, and that man is in no position to "contend with the Almighty" (see <a href="../../par/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>). He brings in from the prophets the illustration of the potter's power and right over the clay, which he fashions and deals with as he chooses. It will be seen, however, as we go on, that this illustration by no means involves, as by some it has been supposed to do, the idea of rejection and condemnation irrespectively of desert.

The figure of the clay, first introduced from Isaiah, is carried out at length in the passage from Jeremiah which is referred to. It is important, for understanding St. Paul's drift, to examine this passage. The prophet, in order that he might understand God's way of dealing with nations, is directed to go down to the potter's house, and watch the potter at his work. The potter is at work with a lump of clay, with the view of making a vessel of it; but it is "marred in the hand of the potter;" it does not come out into the form intended; so he rejects it, and makes anew another vessel after his mind, "as seemed good to the potter to make it." The prophet's application of the illustration is that, "as the clay is in the potter's hands, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel, saith the LORD;" meaning that if the house of Israel failed to answer to the LORD'S purpose, he could reject it at his pleasure, as the potter did the marred vessel; and in vers. 7-10 the view is extended to God's power over, and way of dealing with, all nations of mankind; and then, in ver. 11, the men of Judah are warned to return from their evil ways, lest the LORD should so do unto them. Thus it is by no means implied by the illustration that Israel, or any other nation, has been formed with the primary and irresistible purpose of rejecting it as a "vessel unto dishonour," or that, when rejected, it has not had opportunity of being otherwise; but only that God has absolute power and right over it, to reject it if proved unworthy. It cannot then resist his will (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> determination or resolve; not here <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The primary Divine <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is "that all men should be saved, and come to a knowledge of the truth" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>); and this men do resist. For distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>); but yet he may "find fault" with justice. It is here again evident that it is not individuals, but nations, that are in view all along. The apostle goes on next to consider whether, in God's actual dealings with the "vessels unto dishonour," there may not be, not only great forbearance, but also a merciful purpose.

"And" at the beginning of ver. 23 is omitted in the uncial B, and there is considerable authority of versions and Fathers for rejecting it. Without it the sentence runs better, and its drift becomes more apparent. The purpose expressed in ver. 23 thus comes out distinctly as the grand ultimate Divine purpose, to which the display of wrath and power spoken of in the previous verse is but subsidiary; and this drift becomes the more apparent, if we supply in English, as we may do, "while" before "willing" in ver. 22. Thus the drift would be, "What If God, while willing to exhibit his wrath and manifest his power, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath that had become fitted for destruction, in order that he might manifest the riches of his glory," etc. The idea expressed by "endured," etc., seems suggested by Pharaoh's case (see on ver. 17 with regard to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., which the apostle appears here to retain the idea of, though he varied from it); but it is the Jewish nation of his own day that he has now in view. They were rejected from inheritance of the promises, and under Divine wrath; as he says in another place, "The wrath had come upon them to the uttermost" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>). But they were still borne with; they were not finally cut off; and what if their present rejection were but subservient to the great purpose of mercy to the true Israel? The thought, hinted here, is carried out in ch. 11, where even the idea is further entertained of Israel itself as a nation, after judgment endured, coming into God's true fold at last, according to the design of God, through ways inscrutable by us, to "have mercy upon all." The forms of expression used in the passage before us are to be noted in support of the view we have taken of St. Paul's general meaning. "The vessels of wrath" are said to be "fitted to destruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); of the "vessels of mercy" it is said that God "afore prepared" them unto glory. Predestination to salvation is certainly a doctrine of St. Paul, but he nowhere intimates predestination to reprobation. Further, "Non dicit quae <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, sod <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: praescinditur a causa efficiente: tantum dicitur quales inveniat Deus quibus tram infert" (Bengel). Lastly, it may be observed that, though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> carries with it the idea of individual salvation, yet this only comes in as the outcome and ultimate purpose of the calling of nations or races of men. The drift of the preceding argument remains still what it has been stated to be.

So far nothing has been adduced to support the idea of <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, to whom no original promises had been made, superseding the Jewish nation in the inheritance, though it had been shown generally that God may have mercy on whom he will; and in the earlier part of the argument (vers. 6-13) all that appeared plainly from the Old Testament was <span class="accented">selection</span> out of the total seed of Abraham - not the calling of a new one apart from his stock.

And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God</span>. The quotation in ver. 26 is from <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, and is correctly cited; that in ver. 25 is from <a href="../../par/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>, and varies from both the Hebrew and the LXX., but not so as to affect the meaning. Both refer to the same subject. The prophet had been directed to "take unto him a wife of wheredoms." He had so taken "Gomer the daughter of Diblaim," who had borne him a daughter, to whom was given the symbolical name Lo-ruhamah ("Not beloved;" or, as it is interpreted in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, "Hath not obtained mercy." "<span class="accented">Love</span> and <span class="accented">mercy</span> are both contained in the full meaning of the intensive form of the Hebrew word," Pusey on 'Hosea '); and afterwards a son, who received the name Lo-ammi ("Not my people"). Both are symbols of the ten tribes of Israel as distinct from Judah; the two names denoting (as Pusey explains) successive stages of God's repudiation of the people, and the last implying entire rejection. But in <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, after the naming of Lo-ammi, it is said, "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are Lo-ammi, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the children of the living God." The subject is pursued through <a href="../../par/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>, at the end of which (ver. 23) comes the other passage quoted: "And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy on Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Ammi ['My people'], and they shall say, My God." It might seem that these quotations are not apposite, since they referred originally, not to the Gentiles, but to the ten tribes of Israel. It is to be observed, however, that the words were spoken after these tribes had been declared to be cut off from being God's people at all, so that a principle of Divine dealing is ex- pressed which is applicable to the Gentile world. "This, which was true of Israel in its dispersion, was much more true of the Gentiles. These, too, the descendants of righteous Noah, God had cast off for the time, that they should be no more his people, when he chose Israel out of them, to make known to them his Being, and his will, and his laws, and (although in shadow and mystery) Christ who was to come. He had threatened to Israel that he should be <span class="accented">unpitied</span>, and no more his people; in reversing his sentence, he embraces in the arms of his mercy all who were not his people, and says to them all, that they should be <span class="accented">my people</span> and <span class="accented">beloved"</span> (Pusey on 'Hosea,' 2:23). In <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> the same text from Hosea is quoted as applying to those who were addressed in the Epistle, and then with more obvious applicability; for it appears to have been written, mainly at least, to Israelites of the <span class="accented">dispersion</span> (see <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). Still, Gentile converts may be concluded to have been included (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). It is to be observed that in ver. 25 the feminine <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to the <span class="accented">daughter</span> of the prophet, Lo-ruhamah; and that in ver. 26 "in the place where" must be understood, both in the original prophecy and the application, as meaning any region where those who were to be called <span class="accented">my people</span> might be. "And so St. Peter says that this Scripture, was fulfilled in them, while still <span class="accented">scattered abroad through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</span> The place, then, where they should be called <span class="accented">the sons of the living God</span> is wheresoever they should believe in Christ" (Pusey). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis Zion, wheresoe'er they dwell,<br />Who, with his own true Israel,<br />Shall own him strong to save."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year: Fifth Sunday in Lent.'</span>) The texts from Isaiah which follow are intended to show that, according to prophetic utterance, while those who were not God's people, in large numbers, would be called his people, a <span class="accented">remnant</span> only of the Jews would be so.

The idea seems to be, as it is in the original, that <span class="accented">it is the remnant only that</span>) <span class="accented">shall</span> be saved: for he will finish a word (not <span class="accented">the work</span>, as in the Authorized Version) and cut it short: because a short (rather, <span class="accented">cut-short</span>) word (again, not <span class="accented">work</span>) <span class="accented">will</span> the Lord make (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> accomplish) upon the earth. The Greek of ver. 28, according to the Textus Receptus, is difficult, so as to have compelled our translators to render the participles <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by futures, "will finish," etc. But we have the high and early authority of the uncials <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, for omitting part of the sentence, so as to make it read more intelligibly, thus: <span class="accented">The Lord will make</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> accomplish) <span class="accented">a word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.</span> The longer form, however, agrees, though not quite exactly, with the LXX., which differs itself greatly from the Hebrew, though not so as to affect the main drift of the passage as a whole. The passage is from <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, which had primary reference to the remnant of the house of Israel that should "return unto the mighty God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>) after the then predicted devastation of the nation by the Assyrian king. The series of prophecies with which this is connected begins at <a href="../../par/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, which gives an account of Isaiah's memorable visit to Ahaz King of Judah, on the occasion of the combination of Pekah King of Israel, and Rezin King of Syria, against Jerusalem, in the course of which visit he predicts the birth of Immanuel. He took with him his son, who bore the symbolical name of Shear-jashub ("A remnant shall return"). Subsequently another son was born to the prophet, to whom was given the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz ("Swift of spoil, hasty of prey," as Ewald renders; or, "The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth," as in margin of the Revised Version); the latter name having been previously written on a great roll (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). The primary drift of the prophecies in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>. and the following chapters is that the confederacy of Pekah and Reziu against Jerusalem shall fail, that their own lands would ere long be devastated by the Assyrian king, who would sweep irresistibly over Judah too; but that God's people may still trust in the LORD'S protection, who would preserve and bring back a remnant, though a remnant only. The three names, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, Shear-jashub, and Immanuel ("God with us"), are throughout significant of the leading ideas of the whole series of predictions; the first expressing the certainty of coming judgment, the second the return of the remnant, and the third God's own presence with his people. Now, without pausing to consider what primary historical fulfilment of the prophecy about Immanuel there might be in the way of type, we cannot but perceive, in the language and tone of much in this series of prophecies, a distinct Messianic reference. We cannot, for instance, otherwise understand <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>; and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>. there succeeds an ideal picture of peace and blessing under the "rod out of the stem of Jesse," which is undoubtedly Messianic. Hence the relevance of the passage, not only as showing God's way of dealing with his people in times of old, but also as an intimation of how it should be when the Messiah should come.

This quotation is from <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, and, though it seems to have no obvious reference to the Messianic age, it expresses the same idea as the other, of a remnant only being saved; and it is quoted suitably, occurring as it does at the beginning of the Book of Isaiah, and being a sort of key-note of the prevailing purport of his prophecies. The force of all the above quotations is much enhanced, if we remember that they are not mere isolated texts, but suggestive specimens of many prophetic utterances to the same effect. All familiar with the prophetic writings are aware that main ideas constantly recurring are: First, judgments to come upon the chosen people, painted often in many consecutive verses without relief; but secondly, after such denunciations, a dawn of hope and comfort appearing, and culminating in unutterable blessing under the Messiah's kingdom; and thirdly, this dawn of hope being for a remnant only of the race, compared in one place to a gleaning of the grapes when the vintage is done (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>); and fourthly, the association with this remnant, not only of the "outcasts of Israel" gathered from all lands, but also of a multitude of Gentiles, who should be gathered into the Messiah's kingdom (cf. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>.).

He now views it from the side of human responsibility. The rejection of the Jews is now attributed, not to God's purpose to reject them, but to their own fault, in that they would not accept God's terms. "Hic expresse ponit causam reprobationis, quia scilicet nolint credere Evangelio. Ideo supra dixi, similitudinem de luto non ira accipiendam esse quasi non sit in ipsa voluntate hominis causa reprobationis" (Melancthon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then!

The idea is resumed in ch. 10:3. The concluding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 31, which may have been introduced into the text to make the meaning plain, is ill supported; but the sense requires it to be understood. So far we have a state-merit of the facts of the case. The reason follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31</a></div><div class="verse">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</div><div class="comm">

The genuineness of the concluding <span class="accented">word</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here is doubtful. Its omission does not affect the sense. If retained, it must, according to the rule observed in this Exposition, be translated <span class="accented">law</span>, not <span class="accented">the Law.</span> For they stumbled at the stone of stumbling; as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, expressed in the Authorized Version by "whosoever," has no good support, having probably been supplied from ch. 10:11) believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Here, as throughout the Epistle, the apostle's position is supported by an Old Testament reference. In this instance it is to two passages of Isaiah intermingled (Isaiah 28:16 and Isaiah 8:14). The way in which they are fused is illustrative of St. Paul's way, elsewhere apparent, of referring to Scripture. As a rule, he quotes the LXX., but often varies from it, and sometimes so as to be closer to the Hebrew. Sometimes he seems to be quoting from memory, as one who is familiar with the general drift of prophecy on the subject in hand, and satisfied if the form of his quotation expresses such general drift. In the ease before us, he follows the Hebrew in <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>:14, and the LXX. 2:28:16, where for the Hebrew expression rendered "shall not make haste," the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, apparently with the same essential meaning; for "make haste" seems to signify "haste away in terror and confusion." The two texts combined express the idea of a stone being laid by the Lord in Zion, which should be the support of the faithful, but a stumbling-block to others. It is not necessary to inquire whether the texts themselves have in the original any obvious Messianic reference. Enough that they denote God's plan of dealing with his people. But to understand the full idea in the apostle's mind, when he speaks of "the stone of stumbling," we must take into account also <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, and our Lord's language, as recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42, 44</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/20-17.htm">Luke 20:17, 18</a>. In the Psalms we find the figure of "the stone" used thus: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head <span class="accented">stone</span> of the corner;" and in the Gospels our Lord refers to this text as de. noting himself, and subjoins, with reference to Isaiah, the idea of the same stone being one on which some should fall and be broken, with the additional conception of its crushing those on whom itself should fall. The same view essentially is expressed in Simeon's words (<a href="../../par/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>), that "this Child" should be for the fall as well as for the rising again of many in Israel; and it is repeated definitely in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
