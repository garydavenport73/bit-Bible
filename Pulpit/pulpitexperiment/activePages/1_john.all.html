The neuter (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>) expresses a collective and comprehensive whole (<a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc.); the attributes of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> himself are indicated. Or, as Jelf expresses it, "the neuter gender denotes immaterial personality, the masculine or feminine material personality." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning</span> is not quite the same as in <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; there St. John tells us that the Word was in existence before the world was created; here that he was in existence before he was manifested. Thus far all is indefinite; the philosopher, about to expound a law of nature, might begin, "That which was from the beginning declare we unto you." What follows is in a climax, making the meaning clearer at each step: seeing is more than hearing, and handling than seeing. The climax is in two pairs, of perfects and of aorists; the aorists giving the past acts, the perfects the permanent results. Together they sum up the apostolic experience of that boundless activity of Christ, of which the world could not contain the full account (<a href="../../par/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beheld</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is more than <span class="cmt_word">have seen</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Seeing might be momentary; beholding implies that steady contemplation, for which the beloved disciple had large and abundantly used opportunities. <span class="cmt_word">In our hands handled</span> we may see a reference to <a href="../../par/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>, where the same verb is used <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; and still more to <a href="../../par/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>, where the demanded test of handling is offered to St. Thomas, provoking the confession of faith to which  the whole Gospel leads up, "My Lord and my God!" Had St. John merely said "heard," we might have thought that he meant a doctrine. Had he merely said "heard and seen," we might have understood it of the effects of Christ's doctrine. But "our hands handled" shows clearly that <span class="accented">the attributes of the Word become flesh</span> are what St. John insists on, and probably as a contradiction of Docetism. "Those who read his letter could have no doubt that he was referring to the time when he saw the face of Jesus Christ, when he heard his discourses, when he grasped his hand, when he leaned upon his breast" (Maurice). Between the first clause and what follows lies the tremendous fact of the Incarnation; and St. John piles verb on verb, and clause on clause, to show that he speaks with the authority of full knowledge, and that there is no possible room for Ebionite or Cerinthian error. The first clause assures us that Jesus was no mere man; the others assure us that he was really man. Precisely that Being who was in existence from the beginning is that of whom St. John and others have had, and still possess, knowledge by all the means through which knowledge can have access to the mind of man. (For "seeing with the eyes," cf. <a href="../../par/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>; for <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of contemplating with delight [Stark 16:11, 14], <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the Word of life.</span> "Concerning" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> may depend on "have heard," and, by a kind of zengma, on the other three verbs also; or on the main verb," we declare." "The Word of life" means "the Word who is the Life," like "the city of Rome,...  the Book of Genesis;" the genitive case is "the characterizing or identifying genitive." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is strongly against the interpretation, "the word of life," i.e., the life-giving gospel. Had St. John meant this, he would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-24.htm">John 14:24</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is very frequent of persons (<a href="../../par/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8, 15, 22, 30, 48</a>, etc.). Moreover, the evident connexion between the introductions to his Gospel and Epistle compels us to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the same sense in both (see on John 1:1 in this Commentary, and in the 'Cambridge Greek Testament' or 'Bible for Schools'). What St. John has to announce is his own experience of the Eternal Word incarnate, the Eternal Life made manifest (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>); his hearing of his words, his seeing with his own eyes his Messianic works, his contemplation of the Divinity which shone through both; his handling of the body of the risen Redeemer.

The main thought of verses 1 and 3 is, "We declare to you a Being both eternal and yet seen and known by us." That of verse 2 is, "This Being, in his character of the Life, became visible, and in him are centered all the relations between God and man." Quite in St. John's style, verse 2 takes up and develops a portion of verse 1, using its last word as the basis of a new departure (comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> gives the same fact as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> from another point of view). <span class="cmt_word">Became flesh</span> is the fact in itself; the incarnation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. "Was manifested" is the fact in reference to mankind; their admission to the knowledge of it. The union of "see" with "bear witness" recalls <a href="../../par/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; and here, again, verse 2 resumes and develops part of verse 1. <span class="cmt_word">Have seen</span> sums up the four verbs in verse 1; for in all languages sight is used of experience generally. <span class="cmt_word">Bear witness and declare</span> carries us a stage further - the communication of the experience. It is doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the object of all four verbs or of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> only. Note the double article: <span class="cmt_word">the life, the eternal life.</span> The Epistle begins and ends with this theme (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). (For <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Which indeed</span> (as all must know) <span class="cmt_word">was with the rather.</span> The verse ends as it began, but not with a mere repetition; the Life was <span class="cmt_word">manifested</span>, and in particular to us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship <i>is</i> with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The main sentence is resumed from verse 1, only the chief points being retouched. <span class="cmt_word">We declare to you also</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> must be read before <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, on overwhelming authority); i.e., "you <span class="accented">as well as we</span> must share in it," rather than "you <span class="accented">as well as others</span> to whom we have declared it." Of course, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, must be rendered alike in both verses "we declare." To what does it refer? Not to this Epistle, which does not contain the writer's experience of the Word of life manifested to mankind, but to his Gospel, which the Epistle is to accompany. The parallel between the two writings must often be noted, especially between the Epistle and <a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. Compare this verse with <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>. St. John's aim in writing his Gospel is that the great High Priest's prayer may be fulfilled - that believers may be one in that communion of which the unity between the Father and the Son is the pattern and the basis; may "be joined together in the same body, the same belief, the same knowledge, the same sins, the same hopes, the same destinies" (Jelf). Communion with Christians is shown to mean a great deal - no less than communion with the Father and with the Son. Note the double <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> St. John's writings teem with indications of the unity and yet distinctness between the Father and the Son. Communion with the one, so far from absorbing and canceling communion with the other, implies it as a separate bliss. The clause <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., does not depend on <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> shows; we  must supply <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;</span>. (For <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, where, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is the leading conjunction; in <a href="../../par/john/8-16.htm">John 8:16, 17</a> and John 15:27, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> leads.) <span class="accented">"Blessed</span> <span class="accented">are they that see not and yet believe.</span> It is <span class="accented">we</span> who are here described, <span class="accented">we</span> who are designated. Then let the blessedness take place in us, of which the Lord predicted that it should take place. Let us firmly hold that which we see not, because those tell us who have seen" (St. Augustine, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - While verses 1-3 refer to the Gospel, this refers to the Epistle; but, although <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a> and 1 John 5:13 refer to what <span class="accented">precedes</span>, there is no need to limit <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> here to these opening verses; it covers the whole Epistle. The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> seems preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are not coordinate: <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is the apostolic "we;" <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> means "your joy as well as mine." This verse takes the place of the usual "grace and peace" in the opening of other Epistles; and as verse 3 recalls <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>, so this recalls <a href="../../par/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>. The joy is that of knowing that, though in the world, they are not of it, but are one with one another, and with the Father and with the Son. The gospel is always joy: "Rejoice alway" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>); "Rejoice in the Lord alway" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). To know that the Eternal Life has been manifested, that we have communion with him, and through him with the Father, must be joy. Whereas Gnosticism, by denying the atonement, and "the personal office of God in the salvation of the world," cuts off one great sphere of God's love, and consequently one great cause of the believer's joy. To sum up this introduction: St. John gives his Gospel to the Church <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in order that all may share in the union for which Christ prayed; and to the Gospel he adds this Epistle <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that all may realize the joy resulting from this union - <span class="cmt_word">that our joy may be fulfilled.</span> In this introduction we find the following expressions which are characteristic of St. John, serving to show the common authorship of the Gospel and Epistle, and in some cases of the Revelation also: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. It is among the many excellences of the Revised Version that characteristic expressions are marked by a uniform translation; whereas in the Authorized Version they are obscured by capriciously varying the translation: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is rendered in <span class="accented">four</span> different ways  - "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," "testify" (cf. page 10).

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-25.htm">1 John 2:25</a>, and frequent in the New Testament) must be rejected here and in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a> in favour of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), on overwhelming evidence. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament means "promise," which would be almost meaningless here. The change from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (verses 2, 3) to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is noteworthy: the one is "declare," the other "announce." The message received from Christ, the apostle announces or <span class="accented">reports</span> (<span class="accented">renunciat</span>) to his readers. He does not <span class="accented">name</span> Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; he is so full of the thought of Christ that he omits to name him (cf. <a href="../../par/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7, 9, 15</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is used of <span class="accented">authoritative</span> announcements; of priests and Levites in the LXX; of the Messiah (<a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14, 15</a>); of the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). St. John speaks with authority. <span class="cmt_word">God is light;</span> not <span class="accented">the</span> Light, nor a light, but light; that is his <span class="accented">nature.</span> This sums up the Divine essence on its intellectual side, as "God is love" on its moral side. In neither case has the predicate the article: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Light and love are not attributes of God, but himself. The connexion between this message and the introduction is not at first obvious. But St. John writes with his Gospel before him, and the prologue to that supplies the link. There, as here, three ideas follow in order: <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. There, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately suggests its opposite, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. It is on the revelation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the consequent struggle between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that the Gospel is based. And this revelation is the highest: men alone are competent to receive or reject it. Other organisms exhibit the creative power as life: none but men can recognize it as light. And to know the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as light is to know the Father as  light; for the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the Revelation of the Father's nature. That God is, in his very nature, light, is an announcement peculiar to St. John. Others tell us that he is the Father of lights (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), the Possessor of light (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), dwelling in light (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); but not that he is light. To the heathen God is a God of darkness, an unknown Being; a Power to be blindly propitiated, not a Person to be known and loved. To the philosopher he is an abstraction, an idea, not directly cognizable by man. To the Jews he is a God who hideth himself; not light, but a consuming fire. To the Christian alone he is revealed as light, absolutely free from everything impure, material, obscure, and gloomy. Light was the first product of the Divine creative energy, the earnest and condition of order, beauty, life, growth, and joy. Of all phenomena it best represents the elements of all perfection. "This word 'light' is at once the simplest and the fullest and the deepest which can be used in human discourse. It is addressed to every man who has eyes and who has ever looked on the sun." It tells not only "of a Goodness and Truth without flaw; it tells of a Goodness and Truth that are always seeking to spread themselves, to send forth rays that shall penetrate everywhere, and scatter the darkness which opposes them" (Maurice). In like manner, darkness sums up the elements of evil - foulness, secrecy, repulsiveness, and gloom. In all but the lowest forms of existence it inevitably produces decay and death. Everything of the kind is excluded from the nature of God. And hence St. John, in his characteristic manner, immediately emphasizes the great announcement with an equivalent negative statement: <span class="cmt_word">Darkness in him there is not any at all</span> (comp. verse 8; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). He does not say, "in his presence," but "in him." Darkness exists, physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual; there is abundance of obscurity, error, depravity, sin, and its consequence, death. But not a shade of these is "in him." The Divine Light is subject to no spots, no eclipse, no twilight, no night; as a Source of light it cannot in any degree fail. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - A corollary from verse 5. If God is Light to the exclusion of all darkness, then fellowship with darkness excludes fellowship with him. <span class="cmt_word">If we say</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; "if any of us, no matter who he be, at any time say." The construction marks the supposed action as one likely to occur. The apostle includes himself in the possibility, and of course he and his readers did say that they had communion with God. By" walking" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> is meant our daily life, our movement and activity in the world (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>); this activity will inevitably express the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in which we live. To have communion with him who is Light, and be continually exhibiting a life of darkness, is impossible. The Carpocratians and other Gnostics, who taught that to the enlightened all action is indifferent, because neither purity nor filth can change the nature of pure gold, are perhaps here aimed at (Mansel, 'Gnostic Heresies,' pages 117-121). <span class="cmt_word">We lie, and do not the truth.</span> As in verse 5, St. John enforces a statement by denying the opposite. But the negative is not a mere equivalent of the positive: the two together mean, "we are false both in word and deed." Truth with St. John is not confined to language; it is exhibited in conduct also (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The contrary hypothesis is now stated, and the thought is carried a stage further (cf. verse 9). He again speaks conditionally <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, and does so until <a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>; after which the participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> represents the conditional clause. The change of verbs is significant: we <span class="accented">walk</span>, God <span class="accented">is</span>, in the light. We move through time; he is in eternity. Our activity involves change; his does not. Like the sun, he both is Light and dwells in the light; and <span class="cmt_word">if we walk in the light,</span> which is his atmosphere, <span class="cmt_word">we have fellowship one with another.</span> Darkness is an <span class="accented">unsocial</span> condition, and this the light expels. From verse 6 we might have expected, "we have fellowship with him;" and some inferior authorities read <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But St. John's repetitions are not mere repetitions: the thought is always recur or reset to carry us a step further (cf. verses 3, 4). Having fellowship with one another is a sure result of that fellowship with God which is involved in walking in the light. "Here is a reply to those who would restrain Catholic communion to their own sect" (Wordsworth). Another result of walking in the light is that the blood of Jesus (his sacrificial death) cleanses us day by day continually (present tense) from our frequent sins of frailty. This cleansing is not the same as forgiveness of sins (verse 9). The latter is the case of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the man that is bathed (<a href="../../par/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>); the former is the frequent washing of the feet (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-14.htm">Revelation 22:14</a>). The expression, <span class="cmt_word">the blood of Jesus,</span> in Christian theology, "is dogma with pathos....  It implies, as no other word could do, the reality <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the human body of Jesus, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of his sufferings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of his sacrifice." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By his blood new life-blood is infused into human nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - After the great message," God is Light" (verse 5) and its application to ourselves (verses 6, 7), we are now told what  walking in the light involves: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> consciousness of sin and confession of sin (verses 8-10); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> accepting the propitiation of Jesus Christ the Righteous (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1-2</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> obedience (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If we say that we have not sin.</span> The present <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> again shows that the daily falls of those who are walking in the light are meant, not the sins committed in the days of darkness before conversion. The Lord's Prayer implies that we must daily ask forgiveness. <span class="cmt_word">We lead ourselves astray</span> from the truth, and have no right estimate of the gulf between our impurity and God's holiness, if we deny this habitual frailty. In the sunlight even flame throws a shadow; and that man is in darkness who denies his sin. The truth may be near him; but it has not found a home with him - it is not in him. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> is specially frequent in the Revelation, and always of arch-deceivers - Satan, the beast, antichrist, false teachers; it seems to imply fundamental error (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us <i>our</i> sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - As in verse 7, we have the opposite hypothesis stated, and the thought advanced a stage. Not the exact opposite, "if we confess <span class="accented">that we have sin</span>;" but "if we confess our sins." It is easy to say, "I am a sinner;" but if confession is to have value it must state the definite acts of sin. The context ("deceive <span class="accented">ourselves</span>...  <span class="accented">he</span> is faithful") shows that confession at the bar of the conscience and of God is meant. Circumstances must decide whether confession to man is required also, and this St. John neither forbids nor enjoins. Note the asyndeton; there is no <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, as in verse 7. <span class="cmt_word">He is faithful and righteous,</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be rendered "righteous" rather than "just," to mark the contrast with unrighteousness <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and the connexion with "Jesus Christ the <span class="accented">Righteous"</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). To forgive...  to cleanse. As explained in verse 7, the one refers to freeing us from the penalties of sin, justification; the other to freeing us from its contamination, sanctification. The sense of <span class="accented">purpose</span> is not wholly to be surrendered. No doubt <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, like other particles, becomes weakened in later Greek; but even in later classical Greek the notion of purpose is mixed up with that of consequence. Much more is this the case in the New Testament, and especially in St. John, where what seems to us to be mere result is really design; and this higher aspect of the sequence of facts is indicated by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. It is God's nature to be faithful and righteous; but it is also his <span class="accented">purpose</span> to exhibit these attributes towards us; and this purpose is expressed in <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/1-10.htm">1 John 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Once more we have no mere repetition, but a fresh thought. "We have not sin" (verse 8) refers to our natural condition; "we have not sinned" (verse 10) refers to definite acts. Note the climax: we lie (verse 6); we lead ourselves utterly astray (verse 8): we make God a liar (verse 10). The whole of God's dealing with man since the Fall, especially in the Incarnation, is based on the fact of man's innate sinfulness. To deny this fact, therefore, is to charge the God of light and truth with acting and maintaining a vast and persistent lie. It is difficult to see how this strong language can be reconciled with the Roman dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary: why does not her "son" (<a href="../../par/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26, 27</a>) except her from its sweep? His word is not in us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, we are cut off from all communication with him (<a href="../../par/john/5-38.htm">John 5:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>). "His Word" is the sum total of the Divine revelation. That which in itself is "the truth "(verse 8), when communicated to us is "his Word." How thoroughly the Church of England enters into the spirit of these verses (8-10) is shown by the fact that it appoints confession and absolution as part of public service <span class="accented">every morning and evening throughout the year</span>, as well as of every celebration of the Eucharist. As Bede points out, the Lord's Prayer itself, with the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses," is a conclusive answer to Pelagian opponents of St. John's doctrine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_peter/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Peter 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Peter 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_john/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 John 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 John 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_john/2.htm"><title>1 John 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_john/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_john/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_john/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_john/1.htm" title="1 John 1">&#9668;</a> 1 John 2 <a href="../1_john/3.htm" title="1 John 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.

There are two seemingly opposite truths - sin is wholly alien from the Christian, and the Christian is never wholly free from sin; and St. John struggles to give them their right balance, not in the dialectical manner of St. Paul, but by stating them alternately, side by side, varying the point of view. <span class="cmt_word">We have an Advocate.</span> The possession of the Advocate is as continual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as of the sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). Every one feels that "a <span class="accented">Comforter</span> with the Father" is an impossible rendering. But St. John alone uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, four times in his Gospel of the Spirit (see on John 14:16), and once here of Christ. Is it likely that he would use so unusual and important a word <span class="accented">in two different senses</span>, and that in two writings intended as <span class="accented">companions to one another?</span> The rendering "Advocate," necessary here, carries with it the rendering "Advocate" in the Gospel. Moreover, what is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, if Christ is an <span class="accented">Advocate</span>, but the Spirit a <span class="accented">Comforter?</span> If Christ is one Advocate and the Spirit "another Advocate," all is intelligible. Philo frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the high priest as intercessor for the people, and also of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. There is a difference, however, between "Paraclete" as used of the Spirit and as used of Christ. It is applied to the Spirit in his relation to the disciples; to Christ in his relation to the Father. Christ is our Advocate <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: his advocacy <span class="accented">turns towards</span> the Father to propitiate him.

The propitiation is for all, not for the first band of believers only. The sins of the whole world are expiated; and if the expiation does not effect the salvation of the sinner, it is because he rejects it, loving the darkness rather than the light (<a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>). No man - Christian, Jew, or Gentile  - is outside the mercy of God, unless he places himself there deliberately. "It seems clear that the sacrifice of Christ, though peculiarly and completely available only for those who were called, does in some particulars benefit the whole world, and release it from the evil in which the whole creation was travailing" (Jelf).

Not a fresh commandment do I write to you, but an old commandment. Where it can be conveniently done, it is worth while distinguishing <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "fresh," as opposed to "worn out," "obsolete," from <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "new," as opposed to "old, aged." "New wine must be put into <span class="accented">fresh</span> skins" (<a href="../../par/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>). Are two commandments meant - one to cultivate brotherly love, the other to walk as Christ walked? Or is there only one, which from different points of view may be regarded as either new or old? Commentators are divided; but the latter seems better. Then what is the commandment which is at once new and old? The whole gospel, or the command to love one another? <a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> and John 15:2 will incline us to the latter view. The command was old, for" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) was part of the Mosaic Law. But the <span class="accented">standard</span> was new: "Even as I loved you;" "Even as he also walked;" and the <span class="accented">motive</span> was new: because "God so loved us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). Brotherly love, enforced by such an example, and based on such a fact, was a new command as compared with the cold injunction of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning</span> may have either of two senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from of old, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, long  before the Gospel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the beginning of your career as Christians.

These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. "Hate" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not to be watered down into "neglect" or "fail to love." St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. "He that is not with me is against me." "Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith.</span> For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6, 8, 10</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.9); cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. "If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?" (St. Augustine).

To have no light in one is to be in danger of stumbling; to have light in one is to have no occasion of stumbling (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>, which is very parallel). But elsewhere in the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a stumbling-block or snare in <span class="accented">another's</span> way, not in one's <span class="accented">own</span> way; and this makes sense here.

"They know not, neither will they understand; <span class="accented">they walk on in darkness"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>); "The fool <span class="accented">walketh in darkness"</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a>). "St. John scouts all the pretences of men to illumination which do not involve the practical acknowledgment of brotherhood. A man may say he is in the light as much as he pleases; but to be in the light implies that he is able to see his brethren, and not to stumble against them" (Maurice). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-12.htm">1 John 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - Before passing on to the second thing which walking in the light excludes, viz. love of the world (verses 15-17), the apostle twice makes a threefold address, first stating why he <span class="accented">writes</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, and secondly why he <span class="accented">wrote</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>, to the three classes named. This suggests several questions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What is the difference between</span> "I <span class="accented">write"</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, "am writing") and "I <span class="accented">wrote"</span> (or, "have <span class="accented">written</span>;" for this is a case where the English perfect may represent the Greek  aorist)? Five answers are given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The change is made for <span class="accented">emphasis:</span> "I write; I wrote; there is nothing more to be said." But in this case the past tense should come first: "I wrote; I write it again." Moreover, we should expect the perfect rather than the aorist, as in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "I write" refers to what <span class="accented">follows</span>; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">what precedes.</span> And some have even tried to find out the three different portions in each part of the Epistle; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "I <span class="accented">write to</span> you, little children" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>); "to you, fathers" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18-27</a>); "to you, young men" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28-3:22</a>): "I <span class="accented">wrote</span> to you, children" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>); "to you, fathers" (chapter 1:8-2:2); "to you, young men" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-11</a>). But this is fanciful and very arbitrary; and in this case also the past tense should come first: "I have written thus far to you; again I proceed to write to you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "I write" refers to the <span class="accented">whole Epistle</span>; "I wrote," to what <span class="accented">precedes.</span> This answer has the sanction of the 'Speaker's Commentary;' but it seems to be quite frivolous. What could induce St. John first of all to tell each class that he writes the <span class="accented">whole</span> Epistle to them, and then to tell them that he wrote the <span class="accented">first part of it</span> to them? There would be little enough sense in first saying that he wrote the beginning to them, and then that he writes the whole to them; but there is no sense in the former statement if it comes after the latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> "I am writing" is <span class="accented">from St. John's point of view</span>, as he pens the growing letter. "I wrote" is from <span class="accented">the readers' point of view</span>, as they peruse the completed letter. But what is gained by this change of standpoint? Is it probable that St. John would make three distinct addresses in the position of the writer of the Epistle, and then solemnly repeat them in the position of the recipients of it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The Epistle is written as a companion to the Gospel: therefore "I write" refers <span class="accented">to the Epistle</span>, which he is in the act of composing; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">the Gospel</span>, which lies completed before him, and on which the Epistle serves as a commentary. This seems to be the most satisfactory explanation (see on chapter 1 John 1:4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Who are indicated by the three classes?</span> In the first triplet, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as elsewhere in the Epistle (verses 1, 28; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4, 5, 21</a>), refers to his readers as a whole, of whom <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are two component divisions. This is probably the case in the second triplet also, although the change from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> renders this a little doubtful (see on verse 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Does the difference between "fathers" and</span> "young <span class="accented">men" refer to age as men or age as Christians?</span> Probably the former.

Because they have already partaken of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (verse 2), and have had their sins washed away in the blood of Christ (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>), therefore he writes to them this Epistle.

No less fit, but for a different reason, are the younger among his readers. To fight is the lot of the young soldier; and a victorious warfare against Satan is the distinction of youthful Christians. They have got the better of that evil one in whose power the whole world lies (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>). Not that the warfare is over, but that it is henceforth warfare with a defeated enemy. Hence they also have a right to share in the apostolic message. I wrote (or, <span class="accented">have written</span>) to you, children, because ye know (or, <span class="accented">have come to know</span>) the Father.

The second triplet begins here, and this sentence should have been  given to verse 14.

Probably both words are applied to the whole of St. John's readers. Some would limit <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to actual children; but in that case we should expect a different order - children, young men, fathers; or fathers, young men, children. These "children" know the Father to whom they have been reconciled by forgiveness of sins; they have become his <span class="accented">adopted</span> sons through the Name of his <span class="accented">own</span> Son (verse 12).

St. John is not condemning a love of those material advantages which are God's gifts, nor of nature, which is God's work. He is forbidding those things the love of which rivals and excludes the love of God - all those immoral tendencies and pursuits which give the world its evil character. The world <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is order; the things in the world are the elements of disorder - those things which arise from each man making himself the center of the world, or of some little world of his own creation. These rival centers clash with one another, and also with the one true Center. All this St. John forbids.

As so often, St. John goes on to enforce his words by a negative statement of similar but not identical import. Love of the world absolutely excludes the love of the Father. "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Some important authorities have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; the balance is decidedly for the latter.

Not the former, for its object is already passing away; while not only does the Father abide for ever, but he who loves him and does his will abides for ever also. The antithesis, as usual, is a progress; it carries us beyond the limits of the original statement. The world is passing away like a dissolving view. It has its sentence of death in itself; its decay has begun. And even if it were not passing away, our capacity for enjoying it would none the less certainly come to an end. "The sensualist does not know what the delights of sense are; he is out of temper when he is denied them; he is out of temper when he possesses them" (Maurice). To love the world is to lose everything, including the thing loved. To love God is to gain him and his kingdom. Some men would have it that the external world is the one thing that is certain and permanent, while religion is based on a mere hypothesis, and is ever changing its form. St. John assures us that the very reverse is the case. The world is waning: it is God alone and his faithful servants who abide. As St. Augustine says, "What can the world promise? Let it promise what you will, it makes the promise, perhaps, to one who tomorrow will die." <span class="cmt_word">The will of God</span> is the exact antithesis of "all that is in the world."

It is the last hour. What does this mean? There is scarcely room for doubt. The perishableness of the world has suggested the thought of its end, and St. John goes on to warn his readers that this thought is full of meaning to them; for they may recognize the time in which they are living as the last hour by the many antichrists that have arisen. "The last hour" can only mean <span class="accented">the last hour before the second coming of Christ.</span> Nothing but the unwillingness of Christians to admit that an apostle, and especially the Apostle St. John, could seem to be much in error about the nearness of the day of judgment, could have raised a question about language so plain. All explanations about its signifying the Christian dispensation, or the nearness of St. John's death, or the nearness of the destruction of Jerusalem, must be firmly set aside. How could the rising of antichrists show that the Christian dispensation had begun? It was Christ, not antichrist, that showed that? What had antichrists to do with St. John's death? or with the fall of Jerusalem, which, moreover, had fallen many years before this Epistle was written? Just as the apostles, even after the Resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), remained grossly ignorant of the <span class="accented">nature</span> of Christ's kingdom on earth, so to the last they remained ignorant of its <span class="accented">duration.</span> The primitive Church had not yet found its true perspective, and, in common with all Christians of the first age, the apostles believed that Christ would return soon, possibly within the lifetime of some then living. "Yea, I come quickly" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>) was by them understood in the most literal sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;</span>. But it will not surprise those who remember Christ's very strong declaration (<a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>), to find even an apostle in ignorance as to the time of the second advent of Christ. But it may very reasonably and reverently be asked, What becomes of the inspiration of Scripture if an inspired writer tells the Church that the end of the world is near, when it is not near? The question of inspiration must follow that of interpretation, not lead it. Let us patiently examine the facts, and then try to frame a theory of inspiration that will cover them; not first frame our theory, and then force the facts to agree with it. But the question in its proper place requires an answer. The Old Testament prophets were often guided to utter language the Divine meaning of which they did not themselves understand. They uttered the words in one sense, and the words were true in a far higher sense, of which they scarcely dreamed. The same thing is true of the New Testament prophets,  though in a less degree, because the gift of Pentecost had given them powers of insight which their predecessors had not possessed. The present text seems to be an illustration of this truth. We can hardly doubt that, in saying, "it is the last hour," St. John means to imply that within a few years, or possibly even less time, Christ will return to judgment. In this sense the statement is not true. But it may also mean that the last period in the world's history has begun; and in this sense we have good reason for believing that the statement is true. "That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" is not rhetoric, but sober fact. By the Divine standard times are measured, not according to their duration, but their importance; it is their meaning, not their extent, which gives them value. What are all the measureless prehistoric aeons of the material universe compared with the time since the creation of rational life? What are the thousands of years covered by the Old Testament compared with the portion of a century covered by the New? The great crisis in the history of the world, constituted by the life and death of Christ, will never be equaled until he comes again. When he ascended to heaven the last hour sounded. There may follow a silence (as it seemed to St. John) about the space of half an hour, but (as human experience may prove) of half a thousand centuries. Yet the duration of the period, as measured by man, will not alter its essential characteristics; it was, is, and will still remain, "the last hour." <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye heard</span> (when ye were instructed in the faith) <span class="cmt_word">that antichrist cometh</span> (is destined to come). Antichrist in this also is assimilated to the Christ; he is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This was the teaching of the gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 23-26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22, 23</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). What does St. John mean by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>? The four passages (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) in which he uses the term do not enable us to answer the question with certainty. The predominant idea is that of <span class="accented">opposition</span> to Christ, and <span class="accented">rivalry</span> of Christ, rather than merely of <span class="accented">counterfeiting</span> Christ. If <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were formed on the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean "vice-Christ, vicar of Christ." It is, however, analogous to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Greek for a counterfeit Christ is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). But we are left in doubt whether this rival of Christ is a principle or a person. None of the four passages is decisive. Here we are not sure whether the arising of many antichrists proves that the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist is already in the world, or that by them the way is fully prepared for the one <span class="accented">personal</span> antichrist. Either the existence of the antichristian character, or the approach of the antichrist, is given as evidence that the day of the Lord is at hand. The latter is the more probable. A great personal opponent to the personal Christ seems to be indicated both by St. John and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-8</a>). The Jews expected a personal opponent of the Messiah to precede the Messiah - Armillus, Gog, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the like (Ezekiel 38:39; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>); and Christians from the earliest times have expected a similar prelude to the return of the Messiah. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is absolutely peculiar to St. John in the New Testament. By the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> he probably means those early heretical teachers, who in various ways denied the Incarnation, and were thus forerunners of the antichrist - the Nicolaitanes, Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Diotrephes, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. Besides these there are practical antichrists. "Let us mark, not the tongue but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep silent awhile: ask the life. If the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists if deeds are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out, but many not yet manifest, who have not gone out at all" (St. Augustine).

From the lie St. John passes on to the utterer of it. "Ye readily distinguish any lie from the truth. Who, then, is the liar?" "The liar" does not mean the liar <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, as if this denial constituted the very acme of falsehood. To deny the very existence of God is surely a worse lie. Still less can we say that "the context leaves no doubt that 'the liar' is the same with 'the antichrist.'" The article <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, just as in <a href="../../par/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4, 5</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. The very form of sentence is the same: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> and there <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> cannot mean the victor, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, who is Christ, and not the believer. So that the Authorized Version is not so very inaccurate in rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "a liar." "Who tells lies, if not he who denies (and says) that Jesus is not the Christ?" This was the great Gnostic lie to which St. John's Gospel and Epistle give the answer. The antichrist is this, he who denieth the Father and the Son. "The antichrist" here is not the great adversary, but one having similar characteristics. He denies the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus virtually denies both the Father and Son (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>). This truth St. John proceeds to restate and develop. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-23.htm">1 John 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: <i>(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one who denieth the Son</span> not only does that, but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> doth not possess the Father. To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Son of God, for the Christ is the incarnate Son; and to deny the Son of God is to deny the Father also, for the incarnate Son is the Revelation of the Father; and not only so, but to deny the Son is to cut one's self off from the Father, for "no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him." To emphasize this great truth St. John uses his favourite motive of stating it both negatively and positively. To deny the Son is not to have the Father; to confess the Son is to have the Father (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6, 7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). Note the solemn asyndeta. There is not a single connecting particle in verses 22-24; the sentences fall on the ear like minute-guns. "Every one that denieth." There is no exception. Even an apostle, if he denies that Jesus is the Christ. thereby also loses all possession of the Father. The history of philosophy verifies the statement. Deism has ever a tendency to end in pantheism or atheism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24</a></div><div class="verse">Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> placed first marks the antithesis, "as for you," as distinct from the antichrists. With singular caprice the Authorized Version renders St. John's favourite verb, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in three different ways in this one verse - "abide," "remain," "continue;" thereby losing the emphasis of the repetition: "Let the good seed <span class="accented">abide</span> in your hearts; not be snatched away by the evil one. Then not only will it <span class="accented">abide</span>, but ye also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> will <span class="accented">abide</span> in the Son, and therefore with the Father."

"What St. John would have us feel is this, that there can be no promise to compare with this - that we should share the eternal life, the life of God....  We often speak as if people were to be paid for being good; not as if the being good were itself God's highest gift and blessing" (Maurice). The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (B) for <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is worthy of notice. In verses 16, 17 St. John gives two reasons for shunning the world: because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the world is alien to the Father; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is passing away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So here he gives two for holding fast the truth originally delivered to them: because the truth leads <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to fellowship with God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to eternal life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>things</i> have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26</span> resumes for a moment and concludes the section respecting antichrists. "These things" refers to what precedes, especially verses 18-23, as distinct from what now follows. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the continual attempt of these false teachers to lead the "little children" astray. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>, as in verse 21, is the "epistolary aorist" (see on 2 John 1:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a></div><div class="verse">But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Parallel to verse 24, but stating as a fact what is there given as a command. The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means "from Christ" (verse 20). The indicative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> states what <span class="accented">ought</span> to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (verse 24). The anointing of Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and the quotation of it in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10, 11</a>). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> either as the apodosis of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  so it is true") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  and is true...  and even as"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic "and is no lie" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> may be indicative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the first clause, or imperative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the next verse. The latter is more probable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a></div><div class="verse">And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now,</span> summing up the whole section (verses 18-28).

The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (see on 2 Thessalonians 2:8) is introduced without explanation as a well-known belief. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a></div><div class="verse">If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - This verse forms a bridge between the two main divisions of the Epistle. The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in spite of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and following <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ). To partake of that righteousness which is God's nature is proof of birth from him.

Righteousness must be shown in <span class="accented">conduct</span>; mere desire to be righteous will not suffice. And the conduct must be <span class="accented">habitual</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; a single  act of righteousness will not suffice.

The context must prevail. "Our future state is not yet made manifest. We know that on its manifestation we shall find ourselves like God." The two things will be contemporaneous. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes the following anecdote: "When some heathen converts to Christianity were translating a Catechism into their own language, they came upon <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>. They stopped. 'No; it is too much,' they said; 'let us write that we shall be permitted to kiss his feet.'" Beware of inverting the meaning of the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>. It does not mean that the seeing God is a <span class="accented">proof</span> or <span class="accented">sign</span> of our being like him (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), but the <span class="accented">cause</span> of our being like him: "We shall be like him, <span class="accented">because we</span> shall see him."

Hereafter the sight, "face to face" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), of the Light itself will illuminate us through end through, and we shall become like it.

The best way is to take <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as God, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as Christ: this agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in verse 2, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 5, and with the common use of the two pronouns. It is doubtless possible, especially in St. John, to take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as merely recalling the person already indicated by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or otherwise, and make both pronouns here refer to God. At first sight this seems to make a better sequence between verses 2 and 3: hereafter we shall be like God; therefore here we must strive to become pure as he is. Moreover, it is of the Father that it is written, "Be ye holy; for I am holy" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>); and again, "Ye shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). But the other is simpler grammatically, and preserves the logical sequence equally well. Hereafter we shall be like God. Every one who has such a hope as this will aim at becoming like God here; <span class="accented">even as Jesus Christ has set us an example</span>, a perfect realization of human conformity to God.

Just in so far as he abides, he does not sin. Or it may mean that be who abides in Christ cannot deliberately and habitually sin. But then would not St. John have written, "He that abideth in Christ abideth not in sin"? But the main difficulty is in the second half.

This explanation is preferable. In verse 2 we were told that seeing God will make us like God; and similarly, to see and know Christ make us like Christ. Whoever is unlike Christ, to that extent has not seen nor come to know him. The best of us, it may be, have seen but the hem of his garment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - St. John repeats his declaration with emphasis and fresh considerations; hence the repetition of the tender address (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>), "Little children, let no one ever seduce you into the belief that character and practice can be separated. He that <span class="accented">doeth</span> righteousness is righteous; for a righteous man inevitably practices righteousness." There are always persons who endeavour to reconcile religion with moral laxity, and in St. John's day some Gnostics definitely taught that conduct was immaterial to the spiritual man, for no external acts could defile such. "The external acts," says St. John, "prove the man's spiritual character and origin. He that doeth righteousness is righteous and is of God: he that doeth sin is of the devil." Note the difference between "even as" in verses 3 and 7. There <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces a pattern as a fresh motive for self-purification; here it introduces a comparison.

If the devil committed the first sin, and has sinned unceasingly ever since, then whoever sins is akin to him, is morally his offspring (<a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). There is the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the evil one, and man cannot find or make a third domain; if he is not in the one he is in the other. This verse, like <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, seems to be conclusive as to the personal existence of the devil. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> balances <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: if the one is a mere personification of a tendency, why not the other? Both should be personal or neither. "It is not true that St. John speaks so confidently of a devil because he was a Jew and was filled with Hebrew opinions. For once that the devil is introduced in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets, he is spoken of twenty times in any Gospel or Epistle" (Maurice), and not least in the Gentile Luke. With the latter half of verse 8. comp, verse 5. Christ's act in removing our sins from us destroys the devil's works; for by the manifestation of the Light (<a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>) the darkness is dispersed and destroyed. Our sins are the evil one's works: what is sin in us is his natural occupation.

Who, then, can be begotten of God? But the statement is similar to that in verse 6, and is to be similarly understood. So far as any man sins, his regeneration is incomplete.

An act is different from a state of sin. This is an ideal to which every Christian is bound to aspire - inability to sin. But to some extent this ideal is a fact in the case of every true Christian.

"By their fruits ye shall know them." The children of God do righteousness, and not sin; the children of the devil do sin, and not righteousness. Of course, moral parentage is meant in both cases. Nothing here lends any countenance to the view that the writer is a dualist and inculcates two principles of existence - God and the devil. All, whether good or bad, are God's creatures (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>); but while all are his children by creation, some become his children spiritually also, while others become the children of Satan. St. John's "teaching about the devil is not at all agreeable to those who dwell exclusively on the sunny aspects of the world and of life, and would shut their eyes to what is dark and terrible. They like to hear of a Being who is all-gracious and loving; the vision of one who is the enemy of all that is gracious and loving shocks them - they wish to suppose that it belongs to the world's infancy, and that it disappears as we know more" (Maurice). The expression, "the children of the devil," must not be confounded with the Hebraistic expressions, "children of perdition, children of darkness," <span class="accented">"children</span> of light, son of death," "son of perdition," etc. As so often, St. John not only restates the case in a new form, but adds a new thought to it - he that loveth not his brother. This forms the link with the next section (verses 13-24), on brotherly love. Of all failures in doing righteousness this is the most conspicuous  - failing to love one's brother.

His hearers at last wearied of it, and said, "Master, why dost thou always say this?" "It is the Lord's command," he replied; "and if this alone is done, it is enough."

In the LXX and the New Testament it seems to mean "slay" without necessarily implying the cutting the throat of a victim. That Cain's works were evil is not stated in Genesis, but is inferred from God's rejection of him. Compare carefully the remarkably parallel passage, <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>. The wicked envy the good the blessedness of their goodness, and try to destroy what they cannot share. The war between good and evil is one of extermination; but the wicked would destroy the righteous, while the righteous would destroy wickedness by converting the wicked.

There is still a Cain, the world, hating its Abel, the Church. Therefore <span class="cmt_word">marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth</span>  <span class="cmt_word">you.</span> Here only does St. John use the address, "brethren," which is appropriate to the subject of brotherly love. Elsewhere his readers are "children" or "beloved." The "if" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span> with indicative) expresses no doubt as to the fact, but states it gently and conditionally.

The love of the brethren is the cause, not of the passing over, but of our knowing it. It proves that we have passed. And this test every one can apply to himself; "Do I, or do I not, find the love of the brethren within me?" A Christian can no more live without love than a plant can live without growth. He that loveth not abideth in death: he has not made the passage over. There is no accusative after "loveth," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being a gloss.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - As in <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>, St. John passes at once from not loving to hating, treating the two as equivalent. He takes no account of the neutral ground of indifference. He that is not for his brother is against him. Indifference is hate quiescent, there being nothing to excite it. Love is the only security against hate. And as every one who does not love is potentially a hater, so every hater is potentially a murderer. A murderer is a hater who expresses his hatred in the most emphatic way. A hater who does not murder abstains for various reasons from this extreme way of expressing his hate. But the temper of the two men is the same; and it is obvious (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "ye know what needs no evidence") that every murderer is incapable of possessing eternal life. It is the murderous temper, not the act of homicide, that excludes from eternal life. St. John, of course, does not mean that murder is an unpardonable sin; but he shows that hate and death go together, as love and life, and that the two pairs are mutually exclusive. How can life and the desire to extinguish life be compatible? It is very forced to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as either "destroyer of <span class="accented">his own</span> soul," or "destroyer of the hated man's <span class="accented">soul</span>," by provoking him to return hate for hate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - The nature of love as shown by Christ, and its obligation on Christians. Love has been declared the criterion for distinguishing the children of God from the children of the devil. It remains to show what love is; and this is best seen in a concrete example. "The Eternal Word, incarnate and dying for the truth, inspires St. John to guard it with apostolic chivalry; but also this revelation of the heart of God melts him into tenderness towards the race which Jesus has loved so well. To St. John a lack of love for men seems sheer dishonour to the love of Christ" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - In this (verse 10; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>)we have come to know (have acquired and possess the knowledge of) love (what love is), in that he laid down his life for us.

Cain is the type of hate; Christ, of love. Cain took his brother's life to benefit himself; Christ laid down his own life to benefit his enemies (see on John 10:12). This realized ideal of love we must imitate; ready to sacrifice ourselves, and even our lives, for the good of others. The effacement of another's rights and perhaps existence for one's own sake is the essence of hatred; the effacement of one's self for another's sake is the essence of love. Christ died for those who hated him; and the Christian must confront the hatred of the world with a love that is ready even to die for the haters. This shows that the "brethren" here and in verse 14, though used primarily of Christians, does not exclude unbelievers; otherwise the parallel with Christ would be spoiled (see on verse 10).

(For the Hebraic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> to express the instrument, comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>.) "Nor yet with the tongue" is not a tautological addition. One may love in <span class="accented">word</span> only, and yet the affectionate words may be quite sincere; and this is a common case. People say kind things which they mean at the moment, but afterwards they do not take the trouble to act kindly. But to love <span class="accented">with the tongue</span> only is far worse. This is to say kind things which one does not mean, and which one knows to be unreal. Deeds are needed to complete the kind word; truth is needed to correct the insincere tongue.

"The spirits" are principles and tendencies in religion: these need to be tested, for earnestness and fervour are no guarantee of truth. And to test these principles is the duty of the individual Christian as well as of the Church in its official capacity. Just as every Athenian was subjected to an examination <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as to his origin and character before he could hold office, so the spirit of every religious teacher must be examined before his teaching can be accepted. This is no useless precaution; because, as Christ has come forth <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> from God (<a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>), ninny false prophets have come forth <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> from the spirit of error. But perhaps "have gone forth into the world" means no more than " have displayed <span class="accented">themselves" in publicum prodierunt.</span> There is probably no reference to the false teachers having "gone forth from us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). Besides Cerinthus and other Gnostics, there were the Nicolaitanes, astrologers, professors of magic, and dealers in charms, some of which seem to have had their origin in Ephesus, for they were known as "Ephesian letters." Apollonius of Tyana was eagerly welcomed at Ephesus, and it is not impossible that his visit took place during St. John's lifetime.

As so often, St. John states the case both negatively and positively for emphasis. There is an ancient variant reading of much interest, probably of Latin origin, which can be traced back to the second century, being known to Tertullian and Iranaeus. For <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> it gives <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">solvit Jesum.</span> This corruption of the text was evidently aimed at those who distinguished the man Jesus from the Divine Christ, and thus "dissolved" his Personality. The Greek manuscripts are quite unanimous against the reading. Is not of God; and therefore is of the evil one (see on 1 John 3:10). These professedly Christian teachers are ever among the most dangerous who treat the Divinity of Jesus Christ as more or less of an open question, or as a matter of indifference. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> probably means "the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist," understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> from the preceding clause rather than (quite vaguely) "the characteristic of antichrist" (see on 1 John 2:18, to which passage, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> does not refer, (but to Christian teaching in general). And now it is in the world already. This is an independent statement; St. John does not say that they had heard this previously. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of God.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is in emphatic opposition to the false teachers (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>). They are on one side, and the apostle's readers on the other, and it is from this standpoint that they are to "prove the spirits." St. John knows nothing of any neutral position from which the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error can be criticized "with absolute impartiality." "He that is not with me is against me." This assumed neutral position is already within the domain of error. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have overcome them.</span> "Them" means the false teachers; but in what sense have St. John's "little children" overcome them? He may be speaking by anticipation; confident of the victory, he writes of it as an accomplished  fact (comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). But it is better to take the statement literally. By refusing to listen to the false teachers (<a href="../../par/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8</a>) the sheep have conquered them: the seducers have "gone out" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>), unable to hold their own within the fold. Nor is this wonderful: the one side have God with them, the other Satan. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> here is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/12-31.htm">Luke 12:31</a>). Just as God is in believers and they in God, so the world is in the evil one (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) and the evil one in it.

The "we" here is not the same as the "ye" there, with the mere addition of the writer. "We" here seems to mean the apostles. If it is considered "broad enough to include all who have truly received Christ by faith," it leaves no one to be the hearers. "He that knoweth God heareth us" will mean that we hear ourselves, if "us" means all believers. But St. John's meaning seems rather to be that he who <span class="accented">acquires knowledge</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of God is ready to listen to further apostolic instruction. <span class="cmt_word">From this</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> need not be confined to verse 6; it may apply to the whole passage.

From <a href="../../par/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11, 12</a> St. John renews his exhortations to love, this time at greater length and in closer connexion with the other great subject of this second half of the Epistle, the birth from God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved</span> (see on verse 1) The address is specially suitable where the subject is love. As before, we must not look for the chief purport of the section in the exhortation with which it opens. Just as "prove the spirits" is subordinate to "every spirit which confesseth," etc., so "let us love one another" is subordinate to "God is Love." (For the history and meaning of the specially Christian term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, see Trench's 'Synonyms of New Testament.') 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - In giving the opposite, St. John again varies the thought, this time very remarkably. Instead of "love is of God" (verse 7), we have "God is Love" - a far deeper thought; and instead of "knoweth not God," we have "knew not God," or, as we should say in English, "hath not known" or "never knew God." The man's not loving his brother shows that in no real sense has he ever in the past known God: he is of the world (chapter 3:1), not of God. We must beware of watering down "God is Love" into "God is loving," or even "God of all beings is the most loving." Love is not a mere <span class="accented">attribute</span> of God; like light, it is his very <span class="accented">nature.</span> As "God is Light" sums up the Being of God intellectually considered, so "God is Love" sums up the same on the moral side. Only when this strong meaning is given to the statement does St. John's argument hold, that "he that loveth not knoweth not God." A man who has no idea of any one of the <span class="accented">attributes</span> of God, as order, or beauty, or power, or justice, has an <span class="accented">imperfect</span> knowledge of God. But he who has no idea of love has no knowledge of God, for love is himself. God alone loves in the fullest and highest sense of the word; for he alone loves with perfect disinterestedness. It is love which alone can explain creation. Why should a Being perfectly blessed in himself create other beings, but to bestow a blessing upon them? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The verse is very similar to chapter 1 John 3:16, "in this" referring to what follows, and introducing a concrete and crucial example of love. Beware of the inadequate and misleading rendering "towards us" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It means <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>, and belongs to "manifested," as <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> plainly shows. We must not connect together "the love of God in us," still less "the love of God toward us," as one idea. "In us" means "in our case," and the whole may be paraphrased: "A transcendent manifestation of the love of God has been made in regard to us, in that he hath sent," etc. The verse might serve as a summary of St. John's Gospel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> as applied to Christ is peculiar to St. John; it and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> are the key-words of the passage. "This is love indeed; it is his <span class="accented">only</span> Son whom he has sent, and he has sent him to give us life." Note the double article - "his Son, yes, his Only Begotten." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Let no man think that any higher manifestation of love than this can be found.

The "if" implies no uncertainty (see on 1 John 5:9); it puts the fact more gently, but not more doubtfully, than "since." The "so" <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>  covers both the quality and the quantity of the love. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> belongs solely to <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: "we also on our part ought to love one another." We should have expected as the apodosis, "we also ought to love God." But this link in the thought the apostle omits as self-evident, and passes on to state what necessarily follows from it. In verse 12 he shows how loving God involves loving one's fellow-men (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a> for a similar passage over an intermediate link).

If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No one hath ever yet beheld God.</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> stands first for emphasis. and without the article, as meaning the Divine Being rather than the Father in particular: "With regard to God - no one hath ever yet beheld him" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, stronger than <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Why does St. John introduce this statement here? Not, of course, as implying that to love an invisible Being is impossible; but that the only security for genuine and lasting love in such a case is to love that which visibly represents him. Seeing that God is invisible, his abiding in us can be shown only by his essential characteristic being exhibited in us, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by our showing similar self-sacrificing love <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> can scarcely mean God's love for us; for how can our loving one another make his love perfect? Nor yet vaguely, "the relation of love between us and God;" but, as in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a>, our love for him. Our love towards God is perfected and brought to maturity by the exercise of love towards our brethren in him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-13.htm">1 John 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Almost identical with <a href="../../par/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>. In verses 1-7 the apostle says that confession of the Incarnation proves possession of the Spirit; and in verse 12 that love of the brethren proves the indwelling of God. He now (verse 13) goes on to say that possession of the Spirit proves the indwelling of God; and (verse 15) that confession of the Incarnation proves the same. So that these four facts - confession of the Incarnation, possession of the Spirit, love of our fellow-men, and indwelling of God - mutually involve one another. St. John does not say, "He has given us his Spirit," but "of his Spirit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>." It is impossible for us to receive more than a portion; the fullness of the Spirit is possessed by Christ alone. In <a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a> we have a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have beheld, and do bear witness.</span> The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> clearly means "we apostles;" and "beheld" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> implies contemplation with bodily eyes, as in verse 12. The invisible God can be only "invisibly seen" by the pure heart. But the incarnate Son has been visibly contemplated; and to bear witness of this fact was the very office of an apostle (<a href="../../par/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The language of this verse, as of chapter 1 John 1:1, 3, would be strained and rather unreal in one who had not seen the Christ in the flesh. Note that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> has no article, and is not in mere apposition, but is a second predicate: "The Father <span class="accented">hath</span> sent [see on verse 10] the Son as Saviour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to be such. "The world," as commonly in St. John's writings, is specially the unregenerate among the human race. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-15.htm">1 John 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever confesseth</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>. This rendering seems preferable to "whosoever <span class="accented">shall</span> confess" or "shall <span class="accented">have</span> confessed." The exact meaning is, "Whosoever has once for all taken up the position of confessing." Verse 14 gave the case of the apostles; this gives that of those who accept their witness. In the next verse we have that of both together. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have come to know and believe.</span> Both perfects are virtually presents, expressing the present continuance of a condition begun in the past: "We know and continue to believe." Experience and faith are intimately connected; and sometimes the one precedes, sometimes the other (<a href="../../par/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>). As in verse 9 <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> should be rendered in us, not "to us" or "toward us;" and here also the interpretation, "in our case," is certainly possible, and perhaps safer. But the meaning may be that the object of our knowledge and faith is that portion of his own love which God has <span class="accented">in us.</span> It is "in us," and is exercised towards him and our brethren, but in reality it is his - it is himself abiding <span class="accented">in us.</span> In either case love is the object of our faith. Thus love is not only the true note of the Church (<a href="../../par/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>), it is also the Church's creed. The second half of the verse restates the main proposition of this section with a view to further development. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This verse raises various questions which can scarcely be answered with certainty. Does "herein" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> look back to verse 16? or forwards to "that" <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>? or forwards to "because" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>?

This is the perfection of love to have no fear. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, introduces the reason for this confidence: its basis is <span class="accented">our likeness to Christ.</span> especially in being united to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23, 26</a>). Compare "even as <span class="accented">he</span> is pure" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>), and <span class="accented">"even as he</span> is righteous" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>): <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in all three cases. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Love implies attraction, fear  repulsion; therefore fear exists not in love. Love here means the <span class="accented">principle</span> of love in general; it must not be limited to God's love to us, or our love to God, or our love of the brethren. Love and fear coexist only where love is not yet perfect. Perfect love will absolutely exclude fear as surely as perfect union excludes all separation. It is self-interested love that fears; pure and unselfish love has no fear. Yet nothing but perfect love must be allowed to cast out fear. Otherwise this text might be made an excuse for taking the most unwarrantable liberties with Almighty God. To cease to fear without attaining to perfect love is to be irreverent and presumptuous. Hence the apostle is once more pointing out an ideal to which Christians must aspire, but to which no one attains in this life. There is a fear, as Bede points out, which prepares the way for love, and which comes only to depart again when its work is done. <span class="cmt_word">Because fear hath punishment.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> must not be rendered indefinitely "suffering" or "torment" (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>; Wisd. 11:14; 2 Macc. 4:38). But <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> does not mean "deserves" or "will receive punishment," but quite literally "has it." It is the day of judgment and fear in reference to that day that is under consideration; and fear of punishment is in itself punishment by anticipation. Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, introducing a contrary and then a contrast back again: "There is no fear in love; nay, perfect love casteth out fear: but he that habitually feareth [present participle] is not made perfect in love." The dread of punishment may deter men from sin; but it cannot lead them to righteousness. For that we need either the sense of duty or the feeling of love.

"We have this principle of love." To take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as subjunctive in the sense "let us love" is less forcible. St. John states as a fact what ought to be a fact. "We Christians do not fear, but love. Yet this is no credit to us. After God's love in giving his Son for us it would be monstrous not to love."

What is this love of which the apostle has been speaking? Is it the love of' God or of our fellow-men? Both; love of our brethren is organically bound up with love of God. To love God and hate one's brother is impossible. Sight, though not necessary to affection, aids it; and it is therefore easier to love men than God. If a man fails in the easier, will he succeed in the harder? Moreover, to hate one's brother is to hate God. "Whoso rejecteth you rejecteth me, and whoso rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me." Note the negative, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>.

Sight may hinder as well as help; it is hard to love what is squalid and hideous.

Of the water and the blood widely differing interpretations have been given. It would be tedious and unprofitable to enumerate them. Our estimate of <a href="../../par/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, "the most perplexing incident in the Gospel," will probably influence our interpretation of this "the most perplexing passage in the Epistle." Not that we have here any direct reference to the piercing of Christ's side, and its results. Yet both passages teach similar spiritual truths, viz. the ideas which underlie the two sacraments, and teach them by reference to facts in the life and death of Jesus Christ. But the facts are not the same in each case. It is difficult to believe that this passage contains any definite and immediate allusion to <a href="../../par/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>. Why in that case the marked change of order, "water and blood" instead of "blood and water"? And if it be thought that this is explained by saying that the one is "the ideal, mystical, sacramental, subjective order," the ether "the historical and objective order," and that "the first is appropriately adopted in the Epistle, the second in the Gospel," we are not at the end of our difficulties. If St. John is here referring to the effusions from Christ's dead body, what can be the meaning of "not in water only, but in water and blood"? It was the water, not the blood, that was specially astonishing. And "in" in this case seems a strange expression to use. We should have expected rather, "not shedding blood only, but blood and water." Moreover, how can blood and water flowing from the Lord's body be spoken of his "coming through water and blood"? The simplest interpretation is that which refers <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span> to the baptism of water to which he himself submitted, and which he enjoined upon his disciples, and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> to the baptism of blood to which he himself submitted, and which raised the baptism of water from a sign into a sacrament. John came baptizing in water only <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31, 33</a>). Jesus came baptizing in water and blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in water which washed away sin through the efficacy of his blood. This interpretation explains the marked change of preposition. Jesus effected his work <span class="accented">through</span> the baptisms of water and blood; and it is by baptism in these elements that he comes to his followers. Moreover, this interpretation harmonizes with the polemical purpose of the Epistle, viz. to confute the errors of Cerinthus. Cerinthus taught that the Divine Logos or Christ descended upon Jesus at the baptism, and departed again when Jesus was arrested; so that a mere man was born of Mary, and a mere man suffered on the cross. St. John assures us that there was no such severance. The Divine Son Jesus Christ came not by water only at his baptism, but by blood also at his death. Besides these two abiding witnesses, there is yet a third still more convincing. <span class="cmt_word">And there is the Spirit that beareth witness</span> (to the Divinity of Christ); <span class="cmt_word">because the Spirit is the truth.</span> There can be no higher testimony than that of the truth itself (<a href="../../par/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). It is surprising that any one should propose to translate, "The Spirit is that which is witnessing <span class="accented">that</span> the Spirit is the truth." What has this to do with the context? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-7.htm">1 John 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For those who bear witness are three,</span> and thus constitute full legal testimony (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). It will be assumed here, without discussion, that the remainder of this verse and the first clause of verse 8 are spurious. Words which are not contained in a single Greek uncial manuscript, nor in a single Greek cursive earlier than the fourteenth century (the two which contain the passage being evidently translated from the Vulgate), nor are quoted by a single Greek Father during the whole of the Trinitarian controversy, nor are found in <span class="accented">any</span> authority until late in the fifth century, cannot be genuine.

"If we accept human witness [and, of course, we do], we must accept Divine witness [and, therefore, must believe that the Son of God is Jesus Christ]; for the witness of God consists in this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son." Note the pertinacious repetition of the word "witness," thoroughly in St John's style. The perfect <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> indicates that the witness still continues.

The former is obscure in meaning; the latter, though probably correct as an interpretation, is inaccurate as a translation, for the better  reading is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may be reflexive. The believer in the Incarnation has the Divine testimony in his heart, and it abides with him as an additional source of evidence, supplementing and confirming the external evidence. In its daily experience, the soul finds ever fresh proof that the declaration, "This is my beloved Son," is true. But even without this internal corroboration, the external evidence suffices, and he who rejects it makes God a liar; for it is God who presents the evidence, and presents it as sufficient and true. The second half of the verse is <span class="accented">parenthetical, to</span> show that the unbeliever, though be has no witness in himself, is not therefore excused. In verse 11 we return to the main proposition at the beginning of verse 10. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - "And the substance of the internal testimony is this - we are conscious of the Divine gift of eternal life, and this we have in the Son of God." St. John's <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not "everlasting life:" the idea of endlessness may be included in it, but it is not the main one. The distinction between eternity and time is one which the human mind feels to be real and necessary. But we are apt to lose ourselves when we try to think of eternity. We admit that it is not time, that it is the very antithesis of time, and yet we attempt to measure it while we declare it to be immeasurable. We make it simply a very long time. The main idea of "eternal life" in St. John's writings has no direct reference to time. Eternal life is possessed already by believers; it is not a thing of the future (<a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-47.htm">John 6:47, 54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It is that life in God which includes all blessedness, and which is not broken by physical death (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). Its opposite is exclusion from God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath the Son hath life; <i>and</i> he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Eternal life is not granted to the whole world, or even to all Christians <span class="accented">en masse</span>; it is given to individuals, soul by soul, according as each does or does not accept the Son of God. The order of the Greek is noteworthy - in the first half of the verse the emphasis is on "hath," in the second on "life." Here, as in <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, the article before <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span> should be translated, "hath the life...  hath not the life." The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the second half of the verse points to the magnitude of the loss: the possessor has no need to be told <span class="accented">whose</span> Son he has. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-21.</span> - 4. CONCLUSION OF EPISTLE; without, however, any marked break between this section and the last On the contrary, the prominent thought of <span class="accented">eternal life through faith in the Son of God</span> is continued for final development. This topic is the main idea alike of the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>) and of the Epistle, with this difference - in the Gospel the purpose is that we may <span class="accented">have</span> eternal life; in the Epistle, that we may <span class="accented">know</span> that we have eternal life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have written to you</span> sums up the Epistle as a whole. At the outset the apostle said, "These things we write, that our joy [yours as well as mine] may be fulfilled;" and now, as he draws to a close, he says the same thing in other words. Their joy is the knowledge that they have eternal life through belief in the Son of God. There is considerable variety of reading in this verse, but that of the T.R., represented by the Authorized Version, is a manifest simplification. That represented by the Revised Version is probably right. The awkwardness of the last clause produced various alterations with a view to greater smoothness. The verse, both as regards construction and meaning, should be carefully compared with <a href="../../par/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>. In both we have the epexegetic addition at the end. In both we have St. John's favourite <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, expressing the very strongest belief; motion to and repose upon the object of belief. In both we have the remarkable expression, "believe on his <span class="accented">Name."</span> This is no mere periphrasis for "believe on him." Names in Jewish history were so often significant, being sometimes given by God himself, that they served not merely to distinguish one man from another, but to indicate his character. So also with the Divine Name: it suggests the Divine attributes. "To believe on the Name of the Son of God" is to give entire adhesion to him as having the qualities of the Divine Son. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the confidence that we have towards him consists in this.</span> The thought of <span class="accented">knowing</span> that we have eternal life (verse 13) leads back to the thought of confidence before God in relation to prayer (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21, 22</a>). This idea is now further developed with special reference to <span class="accented">intercession for others</span>; a particular form of prayer which is in close connexion with another main idea in the Epistle - love of the brethren. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-15.htm">1 John 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The point is not, that if God hears our prayers he grants them (as if we could ever pray to him without his being aware of it); but that if we <span class="accented">know</span> that he hears our prayers (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, trust him without reserve), we already have what we have asked in accordance with his will. It may be years before we perceive that our prayers have been answered: perhaps in this world we may never be able to see this; but we know that God has answered them. The peculiar construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> with the indicative, is not uncommon in the New Testament as a variant reading. It seems to be genuine in <a href="../../par/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a> with the  <span class="accented">future</span> indicative, and in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a> with the <span class="accented">present. H</span>ere the reading is undisputed. Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is virtually present; but even the past tenses of the indicative are sometimes found after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> (see Winer, pages 369, 370; see also Trench, 'On the Authorized Version of the New Testament,' page 61). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-16.htm">1 John 5:16</a></div><div class="verse">If any man see his brother sin a sin <i>which is</i> not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - How does this position respecting God's hearing our prayers affect the question of intercession for the salvation of others, and especially of an erring brother? If any prayer can be made with confidence of success, surely it is this. It is an unselfish prayer; a prayer of love. It is also a prayer in harmony with God's will; a prayer for the extension of his kingdom. St. John points out that this reasonable expectation has limits. <span class="accented">The prayer of one human being can never cancel another's free-will.</span> If God's will does not override man's will, neither can a fellow-man's prayer. When a human will has been firmly and persistently set in opposition to the Divine will, our intercession will be of no avail. And this seems to be the meaning of "sin unto death; "willful and obstinate rejection of God's grace and persistence in unrepented sin. "Death" corresponds to the life spoken of above; and if the one is eternal (verse 13), so is the other. Sins punished with loss of life in this world, whether by human law or by Divine retribution, cannot be meant. Christians have before now suffered agonies of mind, fearing that they have committed what they suppose to be the "sin unto death." Their fear is evidence that they have not committed any such sin. But if they despair of pardon, they may come near to it. There are certain statements made respecting this mysterious passage against which we must be on our guard. It is laid down as a canon of interpretation that the sin unto death is one <span class="accented">which can be known</span>, which can be recognized as such by the intercessor. St. John neither says nor implies this. He implies that some sins may be known to be <span class="accented">not</span> unto death. Again, it is asserted that he forbids us to pray concerning sin which is unto death. The apostle is much more reserved. lie encourages us to intercede for a sinning brother with full confidence of success. But there is a limit to this. The sinner may be sinning unto death; and in that case St. John cannot encourage us to pray. Casuistical classifications of sins under the heads of mortal and venial have been based upon this passage. It lends no authority to such attempts; and they have worked untold mischief in the Church. The apostle tells us that the distinction between mortal and venial exists; but he supplies us with no test by which one man can judge another in this respect. By pointedly abstaining from making any classification of sins into mortal and venial, he virtually condemns the making. What neither he nor St. Paul ventured to do we may well shrink from doing. The same overt act may be mortal sin in one case and not in another. It is the attitude of mind with which the sinner contemplates his act before and after commission that makes all the difference; and how seldom can this be known to his fellow-men! The change from <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> is noteworthy. The former is used in verses 14, 15, and the beginning of verse 16; the latter at the end of verse 16. The latter is the less humble word of the two, being often used of equals or superiors requesting compliance with their wishes. Perhaps St. John uses it here to indicate that a prayer of this kind is not a humble one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-17.htm">1 John 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All unrighteousness is sin.</span> "Among the faithful this ought to be an indubitable truth, that whatever is contrary to God's Law is sin, and in its nature mortal; for where there is a transgression of the Law, there is sin and death" (Calvin). But this terrifying truth brings with it a word of encouragement. For if all unrighteousness without exception is sin, it follows that not every sin is unto death. It is incredible that the slightest departure from righteousness should involve eternal damnation (see notes on chapter 1 John 1:7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - With three solemn asseverations and one equally solemn charge the Epistle is brought to a close. "Can we be certain of any principles in ethics? St. John declares that we can. He says that he has not been making probable guesses about the grounds of human actions, the relations of man to God, the nature of God himself. These are firings that he <span class="accented">knows.</span> Nay, he is not content with claiming this knowledge himself. He uses the plural pronoun; he declares that his disciples, his little children, <span class="accented">know</span> that which he knows" (Maurice). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 14</a>, and <a href="../../par/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, which should be compared with this passage. These expressions of Christian certitude explain the undialectical character of St. John's Epistles as compared with those of St. Paul. What need to argue and prove when both he and his readers already knew and believed? We must have <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in both clauses, as in the Revised Version, not <span class="accented">"born"</span> in one and <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in the other, as in the Authorized Version. In the Greek there is a change of tense <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, but no change of verb. The whole should run, "We know that whosoever is <span class="cmt_word">begotten</span> of God sinneth not, but <span class="cmt_word">the Begotten</span> of God keepeth <span class="cmt_word">him</span>." For the perfect participle, comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6, 8</a>: it expresses him who has come to be, and still continues to be, a  son of God. The aorist participle occurs nowhere else in St. John: it expresses him who, without relation to time past or present, is the Son of God. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">conservat eum</span>, not <span class="accented">conserver seipsum</span>, which Calvin adopts. The eternal Son of the Father preserves the frail children of the Father from the common foe, so that <span class="cmt_word">the evil one</span> toucheth them not. The verb for "touch <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the same as in "Touch me not" (<a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In both cases "touch" is somewhat too weak a rendering; the meaning is rather, "lay hold of," "hold fast." The Magdalene wished, not merely to touch, but to hold the Lord fast, so as to have his bodily presence continually. And here the meaning is that, though the evil one may attack the children of God, yet he cannot get them into his power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Omit the "and" before "we know." There is no <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> in the true text; and the asyndeton is impressive. <span class="cmt_word">The whole world lieth in the evil one.</span> This is the second great fact of which Christians have certainty. They, as children of God, and preserved from the evil one by his Son, have nothing to do with the world, which still lies in the power of the evil one. That "the evil" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span> is here not neuter but masculine is evident from the context, as well as from <a href="../../par/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>. "By saying that it lieth in the evil one (in <span class="accented">maligno</span>) he represents it as being under the dominion of Satan. There is, therefore, no reason why we should hesitate to shun the world, which contemns God and delivers up itself into the bondage of Satan; nor is there any reason why we should fear its enmity, because it is alienated from God" (Calvin). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, <i>even</i> in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we know.</span> The "and" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> is here rightly given - it sums up the whole with a final asseveration. Whatever the world and its philosophy chooses to assert, Christians know that the Son of God has come in the flesh, and has endowed them with mental faculties capable of attaining to a knowledge of the true God. The Christian's certainty is not fanaticism or superstition; he is "ready always to give answer to every man that asketh a <span class="accented">reason</span> concerning the hope that is in him" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>); by the gift of Christ he is able to obtain an intelligent knowledge of him who is indeed God. "Him that is true" does not mean God, who is not, like the devil, a liar, but "very God," as opposed to the idols against which St. John goes on to warn them. The Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus the Epistle ends as it began, with a fulfillment of Christ's prayer. In chapter 1 John 1:3 we had, "That ye also may have fellowship with us," which is identical with "That they may be one, even as we are" (<a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). And here we have, "That we know him that is true," which coincides with "That they should know thee the only true God" (<a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). This prayer of the great High Priest is fulfilled. "We <span class="accented">are</span> in him that is true," says the apostle, "(by being) in his Son Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">This is the true God, and eternal life.</span> Does "this" refer to God or to Christ? We must be content to leave the question open; both interpretations make excellent sense, and none of the arguments in favour of either are decisive. The question is not important. "That Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God," who was with the Father from all eternity, is the very foundation of St. John's teaching in Gospel and Epistles; and it is not of much moment whether this particular text contains the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ or not. But if, with St. Athanasius, we interpret "this" of Christ, the conclusion of the letter is brought into striking harmony with the opening of it, in which (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>) Christ is spoken of as "the <span class="accented">Eternal Life</span> which was with the Father, and was manifested to us." Moreover, we obtain a striking contrast with what follows. "This Man, Jesus Christ, is the true God: it is no idolatry to worship him. Whosoever says that he is not God makes us idolaters. But idolatry is to us an abomination."

In answering this question it will be well to hold fast to the common canon of exegesis, that <span class="accented">where the literal interpretation makes good sense, the literal interpretation is probably right.</span> Here the literal interpretation makes excellent sense. Ephesus was famous for its idols. To be "temple-keeper of the great Artemis" (<a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>) was its pride. The moral evils which had resulted from the abuse of the right of sanctuary had caused the Roman senate to cite the Ephesians and other states to submit their charters to the government for inspection. Ephesus had been the first to answer to the summons, and had strenuously defended its claims. It was famous, moreover, for its charms and incantations; and folly of this kind had found its way into the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13-20</a>). As so often happens with converts from a religion full of gross  superstition, a good many of the superstitious observances survived the adoption of Christianity. With facts such as these before us, we can hardly be wrong in interpreting "the idols" quite literally. The apostle's "little children" could not live in Ephesus without coming constantly in contact with these polluting but attractive influences. They must have absolutely nothing to do with them: "Guard yourselves and abjure <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> them." Of course, this literal interpretation places no limit on the <span class="accented">application</span> of the text. To a Christian anything is an idol which <span class="accented">usurps</span> the place of God in the heart, whether this be a person, or a system, or a project, or wealth, or what not. All such usurpations come within the sweep of the apostle's injunction, "Guard yourselves from your idols." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_john/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 John 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 John 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_john/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 John 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 John 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
