The prophet (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>). This title, which is added in the inscriptions only to the names of Haggai and Zechariah, and cursorily to that of Jeremiah (46, 47, 50.), implies that he exercised the practical office of prophet, and was well known; and, as Pusey thinks, Habakkuk appended it here on account of the form in which his prophecy is cast, as being addressed almost entirely to God or the Chaldeans, not to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">Did see.</span> In prophetic vision (see note on Amos 1:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The prophet complains to God of the iniquity of his own nation, and its consequence.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I cry;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Hebrew is taken to imply that the prophet had long been complaining of the moral depravity of Judah, and calling for help against it There is no reference here, as Ewald fancies, to acts of violence committed by the Chaldeans, who, in fact, are announced as coming to chastise the wickedness of the chosen people (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And thou wilt not hear!</span> The continuance of evil unchecked is an anomaly in the prophet's eye; and, putting himself in the position of the righteous among the people, he asks how long this is to last. <span class="cmt_word">Even cry out unto thee of violence;</span> better, <span class="accented">I cry out unto thee, Violence</span>. A similar construction is found in <a href="../../par/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>. "Violence" includes all manner of wrong done to one's neighbour.

So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vociferabor ad te vim patiens.</span> But Habakkuk doubtless speaks in the person of the righteous, grieved at the wickedness he sees around, and the more perplexed as the Law led him to look for temporal rewards and punishments, if in the case of individuals, much more in that of the chosen nation (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>).

The LXX. and the Vulgate translate the word <span class="accented">amal</span> "trouble," or "labour;" Keil, "distress." In this case it means the trouble and distress which a man inflicts on others, as wrong doing seems to be generally spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Spoiling and violence are before me.</span> "Spoiling" is robbery that causes desolation. "Violence" is conduct that wrongs one's neighbour. The two words are often joined; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>.

Septuagint, "Against me judgment hath gone, and the judge receiveth bribes." So the Syriac and Arabic. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Factum est judicium, et contradictio potentior</span>, where <span class="accented">judicium</span> is used in a bad sense.

I will use a heathen nation, he says, as my instrument to chastise the sinners in Judaea; and you shall see that I have not disregarded the evil that is rife among you. Some commentators suppose that the impious are addressed; but Habakkuk spoke in the name and person of the righteous, and to them the answer must be directed.

St. Paul quotes the Greek Version, <a href="../../par/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, in his sermon at Antioch in the Jewish synagogue, warning those who despised the gospel This was sufficiently close to the Hebrew for his purpose. <span class="cmt_word">And regard, and wonder marvellously.</span> They are to wonder because the work is as terrible as it is unexpected.

The Vulgate, too, gives, <span class="accented">facies eorum ventus urens</span>, which Jerome explains, "As at the blast of a burning wind all green things dry up, so at the sight of these men all shall be wasted." This is the meaning of the Anglican Version, which, however, might be improved thus: <span class="accented">The aspect of their faces is as the east wind.</span> The Revisers have, <span class="accented">Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind</span>, which does not seem very intelligible.

The former interpretation regards what is coming, the latter keeps to the metaphor of the wind. <span class="cmt_word">And offend.</span> He is guilty, or offends, as the next clause explains, by attributing his success to his own prowess and skill. Thus the prophet intimates that the avenger himself incurs God's displeasure, and will suffer for it. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which St. Cyril interprets to mean that the Lord will change his purpose of punishing the Jews, and will have mercy on them - a notion quite foreign to the purport of the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">Imputing this his power unto his god;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">this his power is his god</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">even he whose might is his god</span>.

An affirmative answer is expected. This is one ground of confidence in the corrective nature of the chastisement. God is Jehovah, the covenant God, who has been in personal  relation to Israel from time immemorial, and is himself eternal. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Holy One</span>. He speaks in the person of the righteous people, and he refers to God's holiness as a second ground of hope, because, although God must punish sin, he will not let the sacred nation, the chosen guardian of the faith, perish utterly. And then he expresses this confidence: <span class="cmt_word">We shall not die.</span> We shall be chastened, but not killed. The Masorites assert that the present reading is a correction of the scribes for "thou wilt not die," which the prophet wrote originally, and which was altered for reverence' sake. But this is a mere assumption, incapable of proof. Its adoption would be an omission of the very consolation to which the prophet's confidence leads. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ordained them</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for judgment.</span> Thou hast appointed the Chaldean to execute thy corrective punishment on Israel (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>).

Injustice and the distress occasioned by it. God's holiness cannot endure the sight of wickedness, nor his mercy the sight of man's misery. And yet he permits these evil men to afflict the holy seed.

The result is not expressed in the first hemistich, but may be supplied from the next clause, and, as Knabenbauer suggests, may be inferred from the language in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38, 39</a>, where, after quoting the Septuagint rendering of this passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, the writer adds, "But we are not of them that shrink back (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) unto perdition." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ecce</span>, <span class="accented">qui incredulus est, non erit recta anima ejus in semetipso</span>, which seems to confine the statement to the case of one who doubts God's word. <span class="cmt_word">But the just shall live by his faith.</span> The "faith" here spoken of is a loving trust in God, confidence in his promises, resulting in due performance of his will. This hemistich is the antithesis to the former. The proud and perverse, those who wish to be independent of God, shall perish; but, on the other hand, the righteous shall live and be saved through his faith, on the condition that he puts his trust in God. The Hebrew accents forbid the union, "the just by faith," though, of course, no one can be just, righteous, without faith. The passage may be emphasized by rendering, "As to the just, through his faith he shall live." This famous sentence, which St. Paul has used as the basis of his great argument (<a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>), in its literal and contextual application implies that the righteous man will have perfect trust in God's promises and will be rewarded by being safe in the day of tribulation, with reference to the coming trouble at the hands of the Chaldeans. When the proud, greedy kingdom shall have sunk in ruin, the faithful people shall live secure. But the application is not confined to this circumstance. The promise looks beyond the temporal future of the Chaldeans and Israelites, and unto a reward that is eternal. We see how naturally the principle here enunciated is applied by the apostle to teach the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x2c;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> "by faith in me." The Speaker is God. St. Paul omits <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Habakkuk gathers into one sentence the whole principle of the Law, and indeed all true religion.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo vinum potantem decipit.</span> There is no word expressive of comparison in the original, though it may be supplied to complete the sense. The intemperate habits of the Babylonians are well attested (see <a href="../../par/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3, 4</a>; Quint. Curt., 5:1, "Babylonii maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" comp. Her., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5. 15). They used beth the fermented sap of the palm tree as well as the juice of the grape, the latter chiefly imported from abroad. "The wealthy Babylonians were fond of drinking to excess; their banquets were magnificent,  but generally ended in drunkenness" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 3:450, edit. 1865). Neither the Septuagint, nor the Syriac, nor the Coptic Version has any mention of wine in this passage. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the arrogant and the scorner." <span class="cmt_word">He is a proud man, neither keepeth he at home;</span> <span class="accented">a haughty man, he resteth not.</span> His pride is always impelling him to new raids and conquests. This is quite the character of the later Chaldeans, and is consistent with the latter part of the verse. The comparison, then, is this: As wine raises the spirits and excites men to great efforts which in the end deceive them, so pride rouses these men to go on their insatiate course of conquest, which shall one day prove their ruin. The verb translated "keepeth at home" has the secondary sense of "being decorous;" hence the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Sic</span> <span class="accented">erit vir superbus, et non decorabitur</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as wine first exhilarates and then makes a man contemptible, so pride, which begins by exalting a man, ends by bringing him to ignominy. Others take the verb in the sense of "continueth not," explaining that the destruction of Babylon is here intimated. But what follows makes against this interpretation. The LXX. gives, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which Jerome, combining with it his own version, paraphrases, "Sic vir superbus non decorabitur, nec voluntatem suam perducet ad finem; et juxta Symmachum, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, hoc est, in rerum omnium erit penuria." <span class="cmt_word">Who enlargeth his desire as hell;</span> Hebrew, Sheol.

So the two terms signify "a speech containing enigmas," or a song which has double or ambiguous meanings (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>).

The Greek Version seems to point to the weight of the yoke imposed by the Chaldeans on them; but Jerome explains it differently, "Ad hoc tantum saevit ut devoret et iniquitatis et praedarum onere quasi gravissima torque se deprimat." The difficulty lies in the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;</span>, which forms an enigma, or dark saying, because, taken as two words, it might pass current for "thick clay," or "a mass of dirt," while regarded as one word it means "a mass of pledges," "many pledges." That the latter is the signification primarily intended is the view of many modern commentators, who explain the clause thus: The quantity of treasure and booty amassed by the Chaldeans is regarded as a mass of pledges taken from the conquered nations a burden of debt to be discharged one day with heavy retribution. Pusey, "He does in truth <span class="accented">increase against himself a strong pledge</span>, whereby not others are debtors to him, but he is a debtor to Almighty God, who careth for the oppressed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>)."

That mercy was not an attribute of Nebuchadnezzar we learn from Daniel's advice to him (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). The captives and deported inhabitants of conquered countries were used as slaves in these public works (see an illustration of this from Koyunjik, Rawlinson's 'Anc. Men.,' 1:497). What was true of Assyria was no less true of Babylon. Professor Rawlinson (2:528, etc.) tells of the extreme misery and almost entire ruin of subject kingdoms. Not only are lands wasted, cattle and effects carried off, the people punished by the beheading or impalement of hundreds or thousands, but sometimes wholesale deportation of the inhabitants is practised, tons or hundreds of thousands being carried away captive. "The military successes of the Babylonians," he says (3:332), "were accompanied with needless violence, and with outrages not unusual in the East, which the historian must nevertheless regard as at once crimes and follies. The transplantation of conquered races may, perhaps, have been morally defensible, notwithstanding the sufferings which it involved. But the mutilations of prisoners, the weary imprisonments, the massacre of non-combatants, the refinement of cruelty shown in the execution of children before the eyes of their fathers, - these and similar atrocities, which are recorded of the Babylonians, are wholly without excuse, since they did not so much terrify as exasperate the conquered nations, and thus rather endangered than added strength or security to the empire. A savage and inhuman temper is betrayed by these harsh punishments, one that led its possessors to sacrifice interest to vengeance, and the peace of a kingdom to a tiger-like thirst for blood...we cannot be surprised that, when final judgment was denounced against Babylon, it was declared to be sent in a great measure 'because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwelt therein.'"

Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>) applies these and the following words to the destruction of Babylon.

This is cue of the passages which attests "the community of testimony," as it is called, among the prophets. To take a few out of many cases that offer, <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> compared with <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> with <a href="../../par/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a> with <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a> with <a href="../../par/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:145). All the earth is to be filled with, and to recognize, the glory of God as manifested in the overthrow of ungodliness; and therefore Babylon, and the world power of which she is a type, must be subdued and perish. This announcement looks forward to the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which "shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and shall stand forever" (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). We must remember how intimately in the minds of Eastern heathens the prosperity of a nation was connected with its local deities. Nothing in their eyes could show more perfectly the impotence of a god than his failing to protect his worshippers from destruction (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>, etc.). The glory of Jehovah and his sovereignty over the earth would be seen and acknowledged in the overthrow of Babylon, the powerful, victorious nation. As the waters cover the sea. As the waters fill the basin of the sea (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>, where the great vessel of ablution is called "the sea"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i>him</i>, and makest <i>him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - &sect; 11. <span class="accented">The fourth woe: for base and degrading treatment of subject nations.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Not only do the Chaldeans oppress and pillage the peoples, but they expose them to the vilest derision and contumely. The prophet uses figures taken from the conduct produced by intemperance. <span class="cmt_word">That giveth his neighbour drink.</span> The Chaldeans behaved to the conquered nations like one who gives his neighbour intoxicating drink to stupefy his faculties and expose him to shame (comp. ver. 5). The literal drunkenness of the Chaldeans is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">That puttest thy bottle to him.</span> If this translation is received, the clause is merely a strengthened repetition of the preceding with a sudden change of person. But it may be rendered, "pouring out, or mixing, thy fury," or, as Jerome, "mittens fel suum," "adding thy poison thereto." This last version seems most suitable, introducing a kind of climax, the "poison" being some drug added to increase the intoxicating power. Thus: he gives his neighbour drink, and this drugged, and in the end makes him drunken also. For the second clause the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>, <span class="accented">subversione turbida</span> and the versions collected by Jerome are only unanimous in differing from one another That thou mayest look on their nakedness. There seems to be an allusion to the case of Noah (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>, etc.); but the figure is meant to show the abject state to which the conquered nations were reduced, when, prostrated by fraud and treachery, they were mocked and spurned and covered with ignominy (comp. <a href="../../par/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5, 11</a>). So the mystic Babylon is said to have made the nations drink of her cup (<a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>).

Thou hast revelled in thy shameless conduct to the defencelses, but this redounds to thy dishonour, and will only add to the disgrace of thy fall The Septuagint joins this clause with part of the following: "Drink thou also fulness of shame for glory." Drink thou also the cup of wrath and retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy foreskin be uncovered.</span> Be thou in turn treated with the same ignominy with which thou hast treated others, the figure in ver. 15 being here repeated (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>). It is otherwise translated, "Be thou," or "show thyself, uncircumcised." This, in a Jew's eyes, would be the very climax of degradation. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">consopire</span>, from a slightly different reading. The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "Be tossed, O my heart, and shaken." The present text is much more appropriate, though the Syriac and Arabic follow the Greek here. <span class="cmt_word">The cup of the Lord's right hand.</span> Retributive vengeance is often thus figured (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be turned unto thee.</span> God himself shall bring round the cup of suffering and vengeance to thee in thy turn, and thou shalt be made to drink it to the dregs, so that shameful spewing (<span class="accented">foul shame</span>) shall be on thy glory.

It was probably used by the prophet to suggest both ideas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">iniquitas Libani</span> (Vulgate). It would be plainer if translated, "the violence against," or "practised on, Lebanon," as the sentence refers to the devastation inflicted by the Chaldeans on the forests of Lebanon (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). Jerome confines the expression in the text to the demolition of the temple at Jerusalem in the construction of which much cedar was employed; others take Lebanon as a figure for Palestine generally, or for Jerusalem itself; but it is best understood literally. The same devastation which the Chaldeans made in Lebanon shall "cover," overwhelm, and destroy them. <span class="cmt_word">And the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid.</span> The introduction of the relative is not required, and the passage may be better translated, <span class="accented">And the destruction of beasts made them</span> (others read "thee") <span class="accented">afraid.</span> Septuagint, "And the wretchedness of the beasts shall affright thee." Jerome, in his commentary, renders, "Et vastitas animalium opprimet te." The meaning is that the wholesale destruction of the wild animals of Lebanon, occasioned by the operations of the Chaldeans, shall be visited upon this people. They warred not only against men, but against the lower creatures too; and for this retributive punishment awaited them. <span class="cmt_word">Because of men's blood,</span> etc. The reason rendered in ver. 8 is here repeated.

The Revised Version gives, "set to Shigionoth;" and the expression is best explained to mean, in an impassioned or triumphal strain, with rapid change of emotion, a dithy rambic song - a description which admirably suits this ode. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The proemium, in which the prophet expresses his fear at the coming judgment, and prays God in his wrath to</span> remember mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Thy speech;</span> or, <span class="accented">the report of thee</span>; the declaration made by God in the preceding chapters concerning the punishment of the Jews and the destruction of the Chaldeans. The LXX., regarding the ambiguity of the Hebrew, gives a double rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I heard thy report," and "I considered thy works." Pusey considers that both meanings are intended, viz. both what God had lately declared, and all that might be heard of God, his greatness and his workings. <span class="cmt_word">Was afraid.</span> The revelation of God's interposition makes the prophet tremble. <span class="cmt_word">Revive thy work.</span> God's work is the twofold judgment spoken of above; and the prophet prays God to "quicken" and make it live, because, though it brings temporary distress upon his countrymen, it will also cause the destruction of their enemies, and re-establish the Jews and crown them with salvation, and make the glory of God known to all the earth. Dr. Briggs ('Messianic Prophecy,' p. 234) translates, "Jahveh, I have heard the report of thee; I fear, Jahveh, thy work. In the midst of the years revive him (Israel)." He explains God's "work" to be his acts in theophany - his judgment, especially as in ver. 16, the cause of fear to the psalmist. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the years.</span> The "years" are the period between the announcement of the judgment and its final accomplishment (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>); the prophet prays that God would manifest his power, not merely at the extreme limit of this epoch, but earlier, sooner. This overthrow of the world power forms, as it were, the central point of history, the beginning of a new age which shall culminate in the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Make known.</span> Let all the earth know and acknowledge thy work. The LXX. have given two or more versions of this passage, one of which is remarkable. Thus they read, "In the midst of two animals (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) thou shalt be known; when the years draw nigh thou shalt be well known; when the time is come thou shalt be revealed." The rendering, "two animals," arises from a confusion of words  but many of the Fathers, who were conversant with the Greek Scriptures, saw herein a reference to the incarnation of our blessed Lord, as lying in the stable at Bethlehem between the ox and the ass, which was the mystical explanation of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Others interpreted the two animals of the two thieves between whom Christ was crucified; or of angels and men; or Jews and Gentiles; or the two Testaments; or Moses and Elias. Others again accented the word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> so as to understand "two lives," the present and the future, in the midst of which the Judge shall appear; or the life of Christ before his death and after his resurrection. There is a great truth underlying most of these interpretations, namely, that this magnificent hymn is concerned with the victories of Christ and his Church. In wrath remember mercy. When thine anger is displayed by sending the Chaldeans against us, remember thy mercy, and make a speedy end of our misery, and mitigate our enemies' cruelty (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; and vers. 9, 13, 18, 19 of this chapter). The LXX. gives a double version, "In the troubling of my soul, in wrath, thou wilt remember mercy."

As he then came in glory to make a covenant with his people, so will he appear again in majesty to deliver them from the power of evil and to execute judgment. The verbs throughout are best rendered in the present. The prophet takes his stand in time preceding the action of the verb, and hence uses the future tense, thus also showing that he is prophesying of a great event to come, symbolized by these earlier manifestations. Habakkuk here and in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> trees the word <span class="accented">Eloah</span>, which is not found in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or the other minor prophets; it occurs once in Isaiah, twice in Deuteronomy, and frequently in Job. There is no ground for the contention that its employment belongs to the latest stage of Hebrew. <span class="accented">Teman</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Edom; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ab Austro</span> (see notes on Amos 1:12 and <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>). In Moses' song the Lord is said to come from Sinai. Habakkuk omits Sinai, says Pusey which was the emblem of the Law, and points to another Lawgiver, like unto Moses, telling how he who spake the Law, God. should come in the likeness of man. The Holy One. A name of God (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>), implying that he will not let iniquity pass unpunished, and that he will preserve the holy seed. <span class="cmt_word">Mount Paran.</span> The mountainous district on the northeast of the desert of <span class="accented">Et-Tih.</span> The glory of the Lord is represented as flashing on the two hilly regions separated by the Arabah. They both lay south of Canaan; and there is propriety in representing the redeemer and deliverer appearing in the south, as the Chaldean invader comes from the north. The LXX. adds two translations of the word "Pharan," viz. "shady," "rough;" according to its etymology it might also mean "lovely." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This term occurs also in vers. 9, 13, and frequently in the Psalms, but nowhere else, and indicates some change in the music when the ode was sung in the temple service. What is the exact change is a matter of great uncertainty. Some take it to indicate "a pause;" others, connecting it with <span class="accented">salah</span>, "to lift up," render it "elevation," and suppose it means the raising of the voice, or the strengthening of the accompaniment, as by the blast of trumpets. The meaning must be left undetermined, though it must be added that it is always found at the end of a verse or hemistich, where there is a pause or break in the thought, or, as some say, some strongly accented words occur. <span class="cmt_word">His glory covered the heavens.</span> His majestic brightness spread over the heavens, dimming the gleam of sun and stars; or it may mean his boundless majesty fills the highest heavens and encompasses its inhabitants. His praise. This is usually explained to signify that the earth and all that dwell therein, at this glorious manifestion, utter their praise. But there is no allusion as yet to the manner in which the appearance is received, and in ver. 6 it produces fear and trembling; so it is best to take "praise" in the sense of "matter of praise," that glory "which was calculated to call forth universal adoration" (Henderson).

The comparison of the first rays of light to the horns of the gazelle, according to Keil,  is common in Arabic poetry (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). In the original passage, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, we read, "At his right hand was a fiery Law unto them" - a reference to the two tables of stone, perhaps resplendent with light. The "hand" in our text is a general expression, and is not to be taken with any special reference to lightning launched by the hand (which is not a scriptural expression), nor to works effected by God's agency, but simply as signifying that the light of his presence streamed forth from both sides, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> everywhere. <span class="cmt_word">There was the hiding of his power.</span> There, in that ineffable light, was the hiding place of his majesty. He clothes himself with light as with a garment (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>), and the splendour is the mantle of that presence which eye of man cannot behold (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - After describing the splendour of the theophany, the prophet now turns to the purpose and effects of God's appearing. He comes to avenge and judge, therefore <span class="cmt_word">before him went the pestilence.</span> Before him stalks plague, to punish his enemies and the disobedient, as in Egypt, in Canaan (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-9.htm">1 Samuel 5:9, 11</a>); and among his own people (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). For "pestilence" the LXX. reads "word." Burning coals went forth at his feet. "Fiery belts" followed his advance, "hailstones and coals of fire" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12, 13</a>); as in <a href="../../par/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a>, "A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies on every side." But, regarding the parallelisms of the hemistiches, it is better to take <span class="accented">resheph</span> in the sense of "fever heat," as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>; scorching fever follows in his train. Jerome translates the word, <span class="accented">diabolus</span>, looking on the evil spirit as the agent of the Divine vengeance. The Jews, he says, had a tradition that Satan was called <span class="accented">Reseph</span>, from the speed of his movements.

The Revised Version gives," The oaths to the tribes were a sure word;" in the margin, "Sworn were the chastisements (Hebrew, 'rods') of thy word." Thus Dr. Briggs: "Sworn are the rods of thy word." Orelli translates," Oaths, rods of the word," and explains the clause to mean that the Lord comes to execute the denounced punishment, which proceeds from his mouth like chastising rods. The word <span class="accented">mattoth</span> is translated "tribes" (as in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a>) or "rods." Keil contends for the latter, as instruments of chastisement, rendering," Rods are sworn by word" Henderson, taking the words as a military signal, curiously translates, "'Sevens of spears' was the word." Pusey supports the Authorized Version, which, indeed. gives a good sense, and is probably correct It is virtually supported by Jerome, who has, "Suscitans suscitabis arcum tuum, juramenta tribubus quae locutus es," "Thou wilt awaken the oaths," which, so long as the evil prospered, seemed to be forgotten and sleeping. The LXX. emits the word rendered "oaths," and translates <span class="accented">mattoth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou didst surely bend thy bow against sceptres." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>.

If the signification of the word "with" (<span class="accented">eth</span>) be pressed, the passage is taken to mean that, as God manifested himself in old time for the salvation of his people with his chosen "Christ," Moses; so he will hereafter reveal his power for the destruction of the Chaldeans with his chosen "Christ," Cyrus. But this is too definite, and cannot be shown to be intended. The "anointed one," again, is not the nation of Israel, for the term is always applied to a single individual and never to the people collectively; so here it is the theocratic king who is meant - first, the representative of David; and secondly, the Messiah. God reveals himself for the salvation of his people in union with the work especially of his anointed Son, Christ. This is how the passage is taken by Eusebius ('Dem. Evang.,' 4:16), <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. It must be confessed, however, that most modern commentaters translate, "for the salvation of thy anointed," taking the last expression (contrary to all usage) to mean the Israelites, as being a kingdom and nation of priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). In this case the present clause is merely a repetition of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">thou</span> <span class="accented">dashest in pieces the head</span>. As in the following clause the metaphor of a house is plainly employed, "the head" must be taken for the gable or topmost ridge. "The house of the wicked" is an allegorical description of the Chaldaic dominion and its king; and the prophet declares that God will smite with destruction both the ungodly monarch and the kingdom that opposes itself. Some commentators see here an allusion to the primeval sentence (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>): others to the destruction of the Egyptians' firstborn; others to the incident of Jael and Sisera (<a href="../../par/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>). If the prophet's language was influenced by any of these matters, his view and his oracle are concerned with the mighty future. The LXX. has, "Thou wilt east death upon the heads of the evil." <span class="cmt_word">By discovering</span> (literally, <span class="accented">making naked</span>) t<span class="cmt_word">he foundations unto the neck</span>. "By" is better omitted. Keil supposes that "the neck" is the central part of the house, looking from the gable downwards; though why this should be so called is not apparent; and the wording of the original, "the foundations even to the neck," compels us to connect the two words together, and will not allow us to interpret "the neck" of some higher part of the building. The general meaning is plain - the metaphorical house is destroyed from summit to base, the destruction beginning at the gable is carried on to the very foundations According to this view, "the neck" should mean the very lowest basis of the walls. Henderson (after Capellus and others) suggests that we should read "rock," a word derived from the same root. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Thou didst raise chains unto the neck." It is possible that the mention of "the  head," just above, has led the prophet to use the term "neck" in order to express the utter destruction of the whole body. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. Another solemn pause ensues.

There is a difficulty in arriving at the meaning of this last word. The LXX. renders it, "mighty men;" Jerome, "warriors;" Chaldee, "army;" Delitzsch and many modern critics, "hordes" or "inhabitants of the plain;" others again, "rulers" or "judges."

The LXX. renders, "from the voice of the prayers of my lips." <span class="cmt_word">Rottenness entered into my bones.</span> This is an hyperbolical expression, denoting that the firmest, strongest parts of his body were relaxed and weakened with utter fear, as if his very bones were cankered and corrupted, and there was no marrow in them. <span class="cmt_word">And I trembled in myself.</span> The last word (<span class="accented">tachtai</span>) is rendered variously: "under me," according to the Greek and Latin Versions, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in my knees and feet, so that I reeled and stumbled; or, "in my place," on the spot where I stand (as <a href="../../par/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might rest in the day of trouble;</span> better, <span class="accented">I who shall rest in the day of tribulation.</span> The prophet suddenly expresses his confidence that he shall have rest in this affliction; amid this terror and awe he is sure that there remaineth a rest for the people of God. This sentiment leads naturally to the beautiful expression of hope in the concluding paragraph (ver. 17, etc.). Keil and others render, "tremble that I am to wait quietly for the day of tribulation;" that I am to sit still and await the day of affliction. But Pusey denies that the verb (<span class="accented">nuach</span>) ever means "to wait patiently for," or "to be silent about;" its uniform signification is "to rest" from labour or from trouble. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "I will rest in the day of affliction;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut requiescam in die tribulationis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>When he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">When he that invades with bands comes up against the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the day when the Chaldeans attack the Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, where the word "bands" is also used). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: "To go up against the people of my sojourning;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut ascendam ad populum aecinctum nostrum</span>, which is thus explained: "I will bear all things patiently, even death itself, that I may attain to the happy company of those blessed heroes who fought for their country and their God." It is obvious to  remark that this is a gloss, not on the original text, but on the erroneous version.

The Chaldeans, like the Assyrians and Egyptians, cut down and burnt the fruit-bearing trees of the countries which they invaded (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>).

The flock shall be cut off from the fold. There shall be no flocks in the fold, all having perished for lack of food. "Omnia haec," says St. Jerome, "auferentur a populo, quia inique egit in Deum creatorem suum."

The psalmist often thus shews his exulting faith (see <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will joy.</span> I will shout for joy; my joy shall express itself outwardly. <span class="cmt_word">The God of my salvation</span> (see note on Micah 7:7).

This is a musical direction, answering to the heading in ver. 1, and implies that the ode is committed to the conductor of the temple music, to be by him adapted for the public service to the accompaniment of stringed instruments. Such directions are elsewhere always found at the beginning, not the end, of psalms (see <a href="../../par/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/6.htm">Psalm 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67.htm">Psalm 67</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a>.). It has been thought that the suffix of the first person, "my stringed instruments," denotes that Habakkuk had a right to take part in the temple service, and was therefore a Levite; but it is very doubtful whether this suffix is not a clerical error, as Kuenen and Ewald suppose, or merely paragogic. Certainly neither the Greek, Latin, nor Syriac Versions afford it any confirmation. These versions make the subscription part of the ode.
