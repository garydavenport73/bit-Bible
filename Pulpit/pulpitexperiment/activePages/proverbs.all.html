A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 22:16.</span> - Part III. FIRST GREAT COLLECTION (375) OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 12:28.</span> - First section. The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, "a wise son." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The proverbs of Solomon.</span> This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. "Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus," says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. <span class="cmt_word">A wise son maketh a glad father.</span> As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a> and Proverbs 17:21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Treasures of wickedness;</span> treasures acquired by wrong doing (<a href="../../par/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Profit nothing</span> "in the day of calamity" (Ecclus. 5:8; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). The LXX. renders, "Treasures will not profit the wicked;" so Aquila. "For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>); not simply justice and moral goodness, but more especially liberality, benevolence. So in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a> the Revised Version (in accordance with the best manuscripts) reads, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them," Christ proceeding to specify three outward acts as coming under this term, viz. almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In some analogous passages the LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>; Tobit 12:9 (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delivereth from death,</span> shows that a man's heart is right towards God. and calls down special grace. Such a man lays up in store for himself a good foundation, that he may attain eternal life (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-19.htm">1 Timothy 6:19</a>; see on Proverbs 16:6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>). The soul is the life (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). So the psalmist says (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>), "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread." Christ speaks of the providence that watches over the lower creatures, and draws thence a lesson of trust in his care of man. concluding, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26, 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he casteth away the substance of the wicked;</span> Septuagint, "He will overthrew the life of the wicked;" Vulgate, "He overturns the plots of sinners." The word rendered "substance" (<span class="accented">havvah</span>) is better understood as "desire." God frustrates the eager longing (for food or other good things) of the wicked; they are never satisfied, and get no real enjoyment out of what they crave (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That dealeth with a stack hand;</span> that is lazy and indolent (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10, 11</a>; see on Proverbs 19:15). The Septuagint, with a different pointing, reads, "Poverty humbleth a man." <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the diligent</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-24.htm">Proverbs 12:24</a>) <span class="cmt_word">maketh rich.</span> The words for "hand" are different in the two clauses as Wordsworth remarks. The first word is <span class="accented">caph</span>, the open, ineffective, hand or palm; the second term is <span class="accented">yad</span>, the hand tense and braced for vigorous work. The LXX. introduces a clause here which seems to interfere with the connection: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "A well instructed son will be wise. and he will use a fool as his minister;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is aide to make even the foolish subserve his ends. The sentence is quoted by St. Augustine, 'De Civil Dei,' 16:2. The Vulgate inserts another paragraph, which is also found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint at <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12</a>: <span class="accented">Qui nititur</span> <span class="accented">mendaciis, hic pascit ventos</span>; <span class="accented">idem autem ipse sequitur aves volantes</span>, "He who relieth on lies feedeth on the winds, and pursueth flying birds." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">He that gathereth in summer <i>is</i> a wise son: <i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that gathereth</span> the harvest into the barn at the right season. The idea of husbandry is continued from the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Son</span> is here equivalent to "man," the maxim being addressed to the young. <span class="cmt_word">That sleepeth;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that snoreth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui stertit</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A son that causeth shame.</span> The phrase is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>. The Septuagint has, "The son of understanding is saved from the heat; but the sinful son is blasted by the wind in harvest." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</span> So Ver. 11. This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take "mouth" as the subject: "The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence," that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, "the blessing of the Lord." For "violence" the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "untimely grief;" the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chamas</span> bearing also the sense of "misery." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The memory.</span> The lasting, fragrant perfume of a holy life is contrasted with the noisomeness and quick decay of an evil name (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>). As a commentator asks, "Who ever thinks of calling a child Judas or Nero?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will receive commandments.</span> The wise in heart is not proud or conceited: he accepts the Divine Law with all its directions (observe the plural "commandments"), and is not above learning from others; at the same time, he makes no display of his wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">The fool of lips</span> (ver. 10); one who is always exposing his folly. The literal antithesis is better shown by rendering "the solid in heart," and "the loose in lips." So Wordsworth. The Vulgate translates, "The fool is chastised by his lips;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the folly which he has uttered falls back upon him, and causes him to suffer punishment. The LXX. renders the last clause, "He who is given to prating (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), walking tortuously, shall be tripped up." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that walketh uprightly</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>); Vulgate and Septuagint, "in simplicity," having nothing to conceal or to fear. So Christ enjoins his followers to be guileless as children, and harmless as doves (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-15.htm">Mark 10:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Surely</span>; equivalent to "securely;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Aquila, having no fear of inopportune exposure, because he has no secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">He that perverteth his ways;</span> deals in crooked practices. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be known</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>). He shall be exposed and punished, and put to open shame. Having this apprehension always present, he cannot walk with confidence as the innocent does. Hence the antithesis in the text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that winketh with the</span> <span class="cmt_word">eye</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>). This is a sign of craft, malice, and complicity with other wicked comrades. Ecclus. 27:22, "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil." <span class="cmt_word">Causeth sorrow</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>). He causes trouble and vexation by his cunning and secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">A prating fool</span> (as Ver. 8). The two clauses are intended to teach that the garrulous fool is even more certain to bring ruin on himself and others than the crafty plotter. The Septuagint and Syriac have changed the latter clause into a sentence supposed to be more forcibly antithetical, "He who reproveth with boldness maketh peace." But there are sentences not strictly antithetical in this chapter, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 18, 22 (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">The mouth of a righteous <i>man is</i> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A well of life</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>: 18:4). The good man utters words of wisdom, comfort, and edification. God himself is said to have "the well of life" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>), and to be "the Fountain of living waters" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>): and the holy man, drawing from this supply, sheds life and health around. The second clause should be takes as in Ver. 6, <span class="cmt_word">but the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence,</span> the contrast being between the open usefulness of the good man's words and the harmful reticence of the malicious sinner. The Septuagint has, "A fountain of life is in the hand of the righteous; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the wicked." This is explained to mean that a good man's words and actions tend to spiritual health; a bad man's words bring down sorrow and punishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hatred stirreth up strife</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Love covereth all sins</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>). The reference is primarily to the blood feud, the existence of which led to the establishment of the cities of refuge. Hatred keeps alive the old feeling of revenge, and seeks opportunities of satisfying it; but love puts aside, forgets and forgives all offences against itself. This sentiment comes very near the great Christian principle, "Love covereth a multitude of sins" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). The  Talmud pronounces, "To love a thing makes the eye blind, the ear deaf;" and the Arab says, "Love is the companion of blindness." Septuagint, "Love (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) covereth all those who love not strife."

A fool brings upon himself punishment by his insensate talk. Void of understanding; Hebrew, "wanting in heart;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui indiget corde.</span> The LXX. combines the two members into one proposition, "He who putteth forth wisdom with his lips is a rod to chastise the man without heart." In the Hebrew conception the "heart" is the seat, not only of the passions and affections, but also of the intellectual faculties.

He who cherishes hatred in the heart must be a liar and a hypocrite, speaking and acting in a way contrary to his real sentiments; if he divulges his slander, he is a stupid fool, injuring his neighbour, and procuring ill will for himself. The LXX. reads, "Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) lips conceal hatred;" but probably <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is an error for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, though Ewald defends it, and would alter the Hebrew to suit it.

"Speak little," says Pinart ('Meditations,' ch. 6.), "because for one sin which we may commit by keeping silence where it would be well to speak, we commit a hundred by speaking upon all occasions" (see on Proverbs 17:27), Another rendering of the passage gives "By multitude of words sin does not vanish away;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you cannot mend a fault by much talking. But this weakens the contrast, and the Authorized Version is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Is wise.</span> St. James calls the reticent "a perfect man" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>). "This sentence of Scripture," says St. Augustine, in his 'Retractations,' "I greatly fear, because my numerous treatises, I know well, contain many things, if not false, at any rate idle and unnecessary."

Others translate, "die through one who wanteth understanding;" but if the Hebrew will bear this rendering, it is obvious that fools need no guide to their fall; their fate is a natural result. In this case the meaning must be that the foolish man involves others in destruction. But it is best to translate as the Authorized Version.

In acquiring and in using wealth thus blessed, the good man is contented and happy, while unsanctified fiches bring only trouble and vexation. But this seems rather feeble, and it is better to render, "And a man's own labor addeth nothing thereto." A man's own work must not be regarded as an equal cause of prosperity with the favour of God. This sentiment is in accordance with <a href="../../par/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1, 2</a>, "Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it so he giveth unto his beloved in sleep" - what others vainly labour for God giveth to the righteous without toil. The rendering of the clause, "Trouble is of no avail without it," is scarcely warranted by the wording of the text.

The wisdom intended is practical religion, the fear of God directing and showing itself in daily action.

Others translate, "godless hope," or "expectation that bringeth grief," or "strong, self-confident men;" "men in the fulness of their vigour." But the rendering of the Authorized Version is well supported, and the two clauses are coordinate. The Septuagint, in order to accentuate the implied antithesis, has seemingly altered the text, and introduced a thought which favours the immortality of the soul, "When a righteous man dieth, hope perisheth not; but the boast of the wicked perisheth" (Wisd. 3:18).

The evil from which the righteous is saved fails upon the wicked. As Abraham says to Dives in the parable, "He is comforted, but thou art tormented" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>). Of this substitution many instances occur in Scripture. Thus Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai (<a href="../../par/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>); Daniel's accusers were cast into the den of lions from which he was saved (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>).

Septuagint, "In the mouth of the wicked is a snare for fellow citizens." Through knowledge.

Ewald would argue that such language could not be used of the capital of the Jews till the times of Asa or Jehoshaphat. But what is to prevent the sentence being taken generally of any city or community? The Vatican manuscript of the Septuagint and some others give here only the first clause, "In the prosperity of the righteous the city succeeds," adding from ver. 11, "but by the mouths of the wicked it is overthrown" (see on ver. 4; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, etc.).

This would go to prove the superiority of a popular government over the despotism of a single ruler. But the caution of our homely proverb is net inopportune, "Too many cooks spoil the broth." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <i>for it</i>: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is surety for a stranger;</span> or, <span class="accented">for another</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall smart</span> for it.

There is no paronomasia in the Hebrew. The play on "suretyship" and "sure" in the Authorized Version is either accidental or was introduced with the idea of giving point to the sentence. The Septuagint translates differently, "A wicked man doeth evil when he mixes with the righteous; he hateth the sound of safety (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." This perhaps means that the fraudulent creditor deceives the good man who has stood security for him; and henceforward the good man cannot bear to hear immunity and safety spoken of (see note on Proverbs 20:16).

The last clause is rendered, "The manly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are supported by wealth." Between the two clauses the LXX. and the Syriac introduce the following paragraphs: "But a seat of dishonour is a woman that hateth righteousness.

Some commentators, comparing Ecclus. 14:5 ("He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?"), translate, "He who does good to himself is a kind man to others, and he who troubles his own body will be cruel to others." The sentiment is quite untrue. Self-indulgence does not lead to regard for others; and a severe, ascetic life, while it encourages stern views of human weaknesses, does not make a man cruel and uncharitable. The Vulgate takes "his own flesh" to mean "his neighbours," as Judah calls his brother Joseph "our flesh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27</a>). But the parallelism confirms the Authorized Version. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a></div><div class="verse">The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <i>shall be</i> a sure reward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A deceitful work;</span> work that brings no reward or profit, belying hope, like "fundus mendax" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:1, 30. The Septuagint has, "unrighteous works," which seems a jejune rendering, and does not bring out the contrast of the <span class="cmt_word">sure reward</span> in the second member (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To him that soweth righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8, 9</a>). To "sow righteousness" is to act righteously, to live in such a way that the result is holiness. The "reward," in a Jew's eyes, would be a long life in which to enjoy the fruits of his good conduct. We Christians have a better hope, which is, perhaps, adumbrated by this analogy: as the seed sown in the field does not produce its fruit till the time of harvest, so righteousness meets with its full recompense only in the great harvest at the end of all things. The Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">The wicked earnnth deceitful wages</span>: <span class="accented">but he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.</span> This makes a good antithesis. The  Septuagint renders the last clause, "but the seed of the righteous is a true reward (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)."

The Authorized Version takes it for "as;" the Revised Version as an adjective: <span class="accented">He that is steadfast</span> <span class="accented">in righteousness.</span> It is, perhaps, better, with Nowack, to regard it as an adverb: "He who is honestly, strictly, of righteousness, is to life." The meaning is plain: real, genuine righteousness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), translate, "A righteous son is born for life." <span class="cmt_word">He that pursueth evil</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>); Septuagint, "the persecution of the impious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that which an impious man inflicts. But the Authorized Version is correct, and the clause means that he who practises evil brings ruin eventually on himself - a warning trite, but unheeded (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>).

The Septuagint and some other versions take the phrase in the sense of unjust violence: "He who layeth hand upon hand unjustly;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">manus in manu</span>, "hand in hand," which is as enigmatical as the Hebrew. Some Jewish interpreters consider it an adverbial expression, signifying simply "soon." Some moderns take it to mean "sooner or later," as the Italian <span class="accented">da</span> <span class="accented">mano in mano</span>, or, in succession of one generation after another (Gesenius, Wordsworth). Others deem it a form of adjuration, equivalent to "I hereby attest, my hand upon it!" And this seems the most probable interpretation; assuredly the Divine justice shall be satisfied by the punishment of the wicked (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>.). The Authorized Version gives a very good sense: "Though hands be plighted in faith, and men may associate together in evil, the wicked shall not go unpunished" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25.) takes a very different view: "Hand in hand the wicked shall not be innocent;" for hand is wont to he joined with hand when it rests at ease, and no laborious employment exercises it. As though he were saying, "Even when the hand rests from sinful deeds, yet the wicked, by reason of his thoughts, is not innocent" (Oxford transl.). This exposition is, of course, divorced from the context. <span class="cmt_word">The seed of the righteous.</span> This is not "the posterity of the righteous," but is a periphrasis for "the righteous," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, "the generation of the righteous" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>). The climax which some see here - as if the author intended to say, "Not only the good themselves, but their descendants also shall be delivered" - is non-existent and unnecessary. Septuagint, "But he that soweth righteousness shall receive a sure reward," which is another rendering of the second member of ver. 18. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be delivered</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the time of God's wrath (vers. 4, 23; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>).

The external beauty of such a woman is as incongruous as a precious ring in the snout of a pig. Lesetre quotes an Arab proverb: "A woman without modesty is food without salt." Whether swine in Eastern countries were "ringed," as they are with us nowadays, is unknown; if they were thus treated, the proverb is still more vivid.

Delitzsch would translate <span class="accented">ebrah</span>, "excess," "presumption," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>.

That which is thus withheld is no real benefit to him. it only inure, sos his want.

The Vulgate introduces another idea, <span class="accented">Qui inebriat, ipse quoque inebriabitur</span>, where the verb implies rather abundance than excess, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a>, etc. The Septuagint departs widely from the present text: "A passionate man is not graceful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is ugly in appearance and manner - a sentiment which may be very true, but it is not clear how it found its way into the passage. St. Chrysostom comments upon it in 'Hom.' 17, on St. John. There are some Eastern proverbs on the stewardship of the rich. When a good man gets riches, it is like fruit falling into the midst of the village. The riches of the good are like water turned into a rice field. The good, like clouds, receive only to give away. The rivers themselves drink not their water; nor do the trees eat their own sweet fruit, and the clouds eat not the crops. The garment in which you clothe another will last longer than that in which you clothe yourself. Who gives alms sows one and reaps a thousand.

Such selfishness has often given rise to tumult and bloodshed, and has been punished in a signal manner. The legend of Bishop Hatto shows the popular feeling concerning these Dardanarians, as they were called by Ulpian ('Digest. Justin.,' 47:11.6). Such a one St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in 1 Cor.,' 39) calls "a common enemy of the blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of the world, and a friend of mammon, or rather his slave." The Septuagint gives a curious rendering: "He who hohleth corn may he leave it for the peoples!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> may neither he nor his heirs be benefited by his store, but may it be distributed among others far and near! <span class="cmt_word">That selleth it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that breaketh it</span>, as it is said of Joseph when he sold corn to the Egyptians (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>).

The other side of the question is given by the Son of Sirach: "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service" (Ecclus. 10:25).

The Septuagint introduces an antithesis not found in our Hebrew text: "But the souls of transgressors are taken untimely away." Ewald and others change the present order of clauses in vers. 29 and 30, thinking thus to improve the parallelism. They would rearrange the passage in the following way: "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; but the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart; but he that is wise winneth souls." There is no authority whatever in the versions or older commentators for this alteration; and the existing arrangement, as we have shown, gives a very good sense.

The Septuagint, quoted exactly by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a>) has, "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm"><title>Proverbs 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/11.htm" title="Proverbs 11">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 12 <a href="../proverbs/13.htm" title="Proverbs 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof <i>is</i> brutish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Instruction</span>; correction, discpline, which shows a man his faults, gives him a lowly opinion of himself, and opens his mind to receive <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, especially the knowledge of himself and of all moral obligations. <span class="cmt_word">Is brutish;</span> is as insensible to higher aspirations, to regret for the past or hope of amendment, as a brute beast (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-2.htm">Proverbs 30:2</a>).

So St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>) calls his converts "a crown of glorying." The allusion is to the crown worn by the bridegroom at his marriage, or to the garlands worn at feasts (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/3-11.htm">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; Wisd. 2:8). The Son of Sirach has much praise for the virtuous woman: "Blessed is the man that hath a good (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) wife, for the number of his days shall be double.

Such a wife poisons her husband's life, deprives him of strength and vigour; though she is made "bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>), far from being a helpmate for him, she saps his very existence. Septuagint, "As a worm in a tree, so an evil woman destroyeth a man." Here again Siracides has much to say, "A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees" (Ecclus. 25:23). Thus runs a Spanish maxim (Kelly, 'Proverbs of All Nations') - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Him that has a good wife no evil in life<br />that may not be borne can befall;<br />Him that has a bad wife no good thing in life<br />that chance to, that good you may call."</span>

St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25) takes another view, seeing in "judgments" the stings of conscience, and a rehearsal of the day of account. "The righteous," he says, "approach the secret chambers of the Judge in the recesses of their own hearts; they consider how smartly he smites at last, who long patiently bears with them. They are afraid for the sins which they remember they have committed; and they punish by their tears the faults which they know they have perpetrated. They dread the searching judgments of God, even in those sins which perchance they cannot discover in themselves.

"Respectful mediocrity is better than boastful poverty." Ecclus. 10:27, "Better is he that laboreth and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread." But the words rendered, <span class="cmt_word">hath a slave,</span> are literally, <span class="accented">a servant to himself.</span> So the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">sufficiens sibi</span>, "sufficing himself," and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "serving himself." And the expression implies attending to his own concerns, supplying his own wants. Hence the gnome means, "It is wiser to look after one's own business and provide for one's own necessities,  even if thereby he meets with contempt and detraction, than to be in real want, and all the time assuming the airs of a rich and prosperous man." This latter explanation seems most suitable, as it is not at all clear that, at the time the book was written, the Israelites of moderate fortune kept slaves, and the proverb would lose its force if they did not do so.

The LXX. translates "pitieth." The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4, 5</a>); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. <span class="cmt_word">But the tender mercies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the bowels</span>, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have "tender mercies;" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of "feelings," "affections." What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty.

Another interpretation, which, however, seems somewhat forced, is that "the net" is a metaphor for the judgment of God, which overtakes sinners, and into which they run with such blind infatuation that they seem to "desire" it, The safest explanation is the second one given above, which signifies that the wicked man seeks by every means to obtain the prey which he sees sinners obtain, and, as is implied, gets small return for his labour, does not advance his interests. <span class="cmt_word">But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.</span> The root supplies the sap and vigour needed for healthy produce. Without any evil devices or plotting, the righteous gain all that they want as the natural result of their high principles. Another hindering is, "He (the Lord) will give a root of the righteous," will enable them to stand firm in time of trial.

Often when he has spoken in order to injure others, the slander or the censure has redounded on himself (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>). The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares. The Septuagint here introduces a couplet not found in the Hebrew: "He who looketh gently (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) shall obtain mercy; but he who frequents the gates [or, 'contends in the gates,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>] will harass souls." This seems to mean the man who is calm and considerate for others will himself be treated with pity and consideration (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>); but he who is a gossip, or a busybody, or litigious, will be always vexing his neighbours.

The word rendered "cheat," <span class="accented">fraudulentus</span> in the Latin, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Greek, is the same as that rightly translated "slothful" (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">But the substance of a diligent man is precious;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>the substance which an honest, industrious man acquires by his labour is stable and of real value. This second clause, however, is variously translated, Revised Version, <span class="accented">But the</span> <span class="accented">precious substance of men is to the diligent</span>, or, <span class="accented">is to be diligent</span>; Delitzsch, "Diligence is a man's precious possession;" Septuagint, "A pure man is a precious possession." The Authorized Version is probably erroneous, and the rendering should be, as Delitzsch and Nowack take it, "But a precious possession of a man is diligence." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a></div><div class="verse">In the way of righteousness <i>is</i> life; and <i>in</i> the pathway <i>thereof there is</i> no death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the way of righteousness is life</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>). For the promise of temporal prosperity which the Jew saw in such passages as these we substitute a better hope. <span class="cmt_word">And in the pathway</span> thereof - of righteousness - <span class="cmt_word">there is no death.</span> Many combine the two words thus: "no death," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> immortality; but examples of such combination are not forthcoming, and the anomaly is not necessitated by the failure of the usual rendering to afford an adequate sense. The Greek and Latin versions are noteworthy. Septuagint, "The ways of the revengeful (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are unto (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) death." St. Chrysostom refers ('Hom. 16 in Ephesians') to this rendering: "He here speaks of vindictiveness; for on the spur of the moment he allows the sufferer to act in order to cheek the aggressor; but further to bear a grudge he permits not; because the act then is no longer one of passion, nor of boiling rage, but of malice premeditated. Now, God forgives those who may be carried away, perhaps upon a sense of outrage, and rush out to resent it. Hence he says, 'eye for eye;' and yet again 'The ways of the revengeful lead to death." Vulgate, "A devious path leads to death" - a path, that is, which turns aside from the right direction, a life and conversation which are alien from justice and piety. But both the Septuagint and the Vulgate have missed the right meaning of the words in question; <span class="accented">derek nethibah</span>, "pathway." Many see in this verse a plain evidence that the writer believed in the immortality of the soul. We have reason to suppose that such was his faith, but it cannot be proved from this passage, though we may consider that he was guided to speak in terms to which later knowledge would affix a deeper interpretation (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and note there). It is Jesus Christ "who hath brought life and immortality (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) to light through the gospel" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Writers in Solomon's time could speak only darkly about this sublime and comforting hope, though later, as in the Book of Wisdom and throughout most of the Apocryphal books, it formed a common topic, and was used as a reason for patience and resignation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/13.htm"><title>Proverbs 13 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/13.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/13.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/13-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/12.htm" title="Proverbs 12">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 13 <a href="../proverbs/14.htm" title="Proverbs 14">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a></div><div class="verse">A wise son <i>heareth</i> his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 15:19.</span> Second section in this collection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise son heareth his father's instruction.</span> The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the second member.

By his kindly speech and wise counsels he shall gain the good will of his neighbours and the blessing of God. Schultens observes that the word rendered "good" (<span class="accented">tob</span>) means what is pleasant to taste and smell, while that translated "violence" (<span class="accented">chamas</span>) signifies literally what is crude and unripe. <span class="cmt_word">The soul of the transgressors shall eat violence</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>). The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the first clause unnecessarily. The meaning of this rendering is that sinners, especially the treacherous, bring on themselves retribution; the injuries which they devise against others recoil on their own heads (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a>). The Hebrew is, "The soul (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the desire, or delight) of the perfidious (is) violence." Such men have only one thing at heart, viz. to wrong their neighbour, and to increase their own property by any, even nefarious, precedings. Septuagint, "Of the fruits of righteousness the good man shall eat; but the lives of transgressors shall perish untimely."

The Vulgate paraphrases, "He who is inconsiderate in speech shall experience evils;" Septuagint, "will terrify himself" - will occasion to himself many terrible alarms and inflictions. Hence the psalmist prays, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my lips." So we have in the Danish, "A silent man's words are not brought into court;" and in the Spanish, "Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for;" while the Italians tell us, "The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf:" and "Silence was never written down" (Kelly).

Vulgate, "The indolent wishers, and wishes not;" he wishes for something, but he wishes not for the labour of getting it; he would like the result, but he hates the process by which the result is to be obtained.

This naturally betrays itself by the speech, according to the proverb, "Show me a liar, and I will show you a thief." <span class="cmt_word">A wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</span> The clause is variously translated. Vulgate, <span class="accented">confundit et confundetur</span>, "causes shame to others and to himself."

Hitzig, "behaveth injuriously and shamefully." The antithesis is best brought out by the rendering that marks the effect of the wicked man's "lying;" "He brings disgrace upon others (who have trusted him or have been associated with him) and causes shame."

There are some who pretend to be rich while really they are poor (as <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a>), and there are some who make themselves, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pretend to be poor (as misers) while they have much wealth. The Vulgate elucidates this meaning by rendering, <span class="accented">quasi dives</span> and <span class="accented">quasi pauper</span>; and the Hebrew verbs confirm its correctness. The proverb in both members teaches one not to trust to appearances. Septuagint, "There are who enrich themselves, having nothing; and there are who humble themselves amid much wealth." It is obvious that such a version lends itself to a Christian interpretation. The first clause reminds one of the rich fool who laid up treasure for himself, and was not rich toward God  (<a href="../../par/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>). The second clause teaches that wealth expended in God's service makes a man rich in the treasury of heaven (<a href="../../par/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21, 33</a>). One who thus uses the means entrusted to him could be spoken of like St. Paul, "as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>).

Spiritually discerned, the passage recalls Christ's injunction, "Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poor heareth not rebuke;</span> has not to listen to (<a href="../../par/job/3-18.htm">Job 3:18</a>) threats from the covetous or abuse from the envious.

The lamp of the wicked is the false show of wisdom or piety, which may glimmer and deceive for a time, but is ere long detected and brought to naught. There may be here an allusion to a common custom in the East. "No house, however poor," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 1:117), "is left without a light burning in it all night; the housewife rising betimes to secure its continuance by replenishing the lamp with oil.

Septuagint, "The light of the righteous is everlasting; but the light of sinners is quenched." Then is introduced a couplet not found in the Hebrew, of which the latter part is borrowed from <a href="../../par/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a> or Psalms 112:5, "Crafty souls go astray in sins; righteous men show mercy and pity."

Many refer this sentence to the impatient longing for heaven which holy men feel, such as we may read in 'De Imitatione,' 3:48, 49, and in the hymns, "For thee, O dear, dear country;" and "We've no abiding city," etc.  And St. Paul can exclaim (<a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>), "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). Septuagint, "Better is he who taketh in hand to aid with all his heart, than he who promises and raises hopes" (comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When the desire cometh</span> - when the object of the longing is obtained - <span class="cmt_word">it is a tree of life</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>); there are then no longer languor and despondence, but strength and refreshment and vigorous action. Septuagint, "A good desire is a tree of life." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed.</span> "The word" is either the commandment of God (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>), or warning and instruction. He who despises and neglects this word "brings on himself destruction." Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, "is pledged by it;" as Revised Version in margin, "maketh himself a debtor thereto," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). Vulgate, "He who disparages (<span class="accented">detrahit</span>) anything binds himself for the future." Septuagint, "He who despises a thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, 'a command') shall be despised by it." <span class="accented">Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>). The Vulgate rendering, "shall live in peace," and that of the Septuagint, "shall be healthful," are not so suitable. The "fearing the commandment" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, "Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright." This is also found in the Vulgate of <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>. The Vulgate here inserts the paragraph found in the Septuagint at ver. 9 (<span class="accented">q.v</span>.), <span class="accented">Animae dolosae errant in peccatis</span>; <span class="accented">justi autem misericordes sunt et miserantur.</span>

We are told of Christ that "he increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). As a good and wise man uses his gifts and graces properly, he wins higher favour from God, and kindles the love and respect of his fellow men. Alter this clause the Septuagint introduces that which occurs also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, "It belongs to a good understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) to know the Law." <span class="cmt_word">The way of transgressors is hard;</span> rough and rugged, leading to desolation, not to waters of comfort. Ecclus. 21:10, "The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell."

Nowack takes the two nouns as predicates: "He that refuseth discipline is poverty and shame," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are his lot. Such a one indulges his own lusts and passions, is headstrong in pursuing his own plans, and thus dissipates his fortune and acquires the contempt of all good men. Septuagint, "Discipline taketh away poverty and disgrace." He that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. To listen to rebuke and to profit thereby is a proof of humility and self-knowledge, which wins respect from others. Lesetre refers to Theodosius's submission to the sentence imposed upon him by St. Ambrose as a real honour and glory to him (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5, 32</a>).

This is usually taken to mean the desire of what is good and honest, when it is fulfilled and realized, is a source of highest joy and comfort to the wise. Septuagint, "The desires of the pious are sweet to the soul." <span class="cmt_word">But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious, but it may be: it is sweet to a good man to obtain his wish; but for a wicked man to leave, to abandon evil to which he clings so fondly, is a detestable alternative. Or the latter clause may mean that the wicked will not give up the evil which makes the satisfaction of their desire impossible. But it is best to take the first clause as a general statement, viz. the satisfaction of desire is pleasant to all men; then the latter member gives a special case and will signify, "For the sake of this pleasure bad men will not give up their evil wishes and plans; they will pursue what they have set their heart upon because they hate the idea of foregoing their evil designs." Septuagint, "The deeds of sinners are far from knowledge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from practical wisdom, prudence, and piety.

But the antithesis is not well brought out by this rendering: and as the word may bear the sense of "doing ill" as well as of "suffering ill," the interpretation of the Vulgat. intimates the correct idea of the clause: "The friend of fools shall turn out the same;" "He who associates with fools shall do evil." Septuagint, "He who roams about with fools shall be known." "Tell me your companions, and I will tell you what you are." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Talis quis esse putatur qualis ei est sodalitas."</span> A Dutch proverb says, "He that lives with cripples learns to limp;" and the Spanish, "He that goes with wolves learns to howl."

He who lives an upright life does so because he fears the Lord; and his holy conversation is an evidence that he is influenced by religious motives. The outward conduct shows the inward feeling. So he that is <span class="cmt_word">perverse in his ways despiseth him</span> - the Lord. A man is evil in his actions because he has cast off the fear of God; and such wickedness is a proof that he has lost all reverence for God and care to please him. Delitzsch renders, "He walketh in his uprightness who feareth Jahve, and perverse in his ways is he that despiseth him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of the two shows the way in which they severally regard God and religion, the former acting conscientiously and uprightly, the latter following his own lusts, which lead him astray. Either interpretation is admissible. Septuagint, "He that walketh in crooked ways (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) shall he dishonoured." The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the sentence, "He who walketh in the right way and feareth the Lord is despised by him who pursueth the path of shame." This intimates the hatred which sinners feel for the godly (comp. <a href="../../par/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>; and especially Wisd. 2:10-20; and our Lord's warning, <a href="../../par/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a>).

Septuagint, "From the mouth of fools cometh a staff of insolence." The lips of the wise shall preserve them - the wise (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>). These do not abuse speech to insult and injure others; and their words tend to conciliate others, and promote peace and good will (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-6.htm">Proverbs 12:6, 18</a>).

A scorner may affect to be seeking wisdom, but he can never attain to it, because it is given only to him who is meek and fears the Lord (<a href="../../par/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a>). Wisd. 1:4, "Into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is pledged to sin" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>). True wisdom is not to be won by those who are too conceited to receive instruction, and presume to depend upon their own judgment, and to weigh everything by their own standard. This is especially true of the knowledge of Divine things, which "scorners" never really acquire. Septuagint, "Thou shalt seek wisdom among the wicked, but thou shalt find it not." <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth;</span> "that hath understanding," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the man who realizes that the fear of God is a necessary condition to the acquiring of wisdom, and who seeks it as a boon at his hands. This acquisition, as it is difficult, nay, impossible for the scorner, is comparatively easy for the humble believer who seeks it with the right temper and in the right way. "Mysteries are revealed unto the meek" (Ecclus. 3:19, in some manuscripts). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not <i>in him</i> the lips of knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go from the presence of a foolish man.</span> There is some doubt about the rendering of this passage. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">vade contra stultum</span>, which is probably to be taken in the sense of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has, "Go into the presence of a foolish man." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">minneged</span>) may mean "from before," "over against," "in the presence of." Hence arises an ambiguity. The Authorized Version considers the sentence to be an injunction to turn away from a stupid man when you perceive that you can do him no good. The Revised Version is equivalent to "if you go into the presence," etc. <span class="cmt_word">When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and thou shalt not perceive in him</span>, etc., which embodies a truism with no special point. The whole sentence is better translated, <span class="accented">Go forth from the presence of a foolish man, and thou hast not known the lips of knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Nowack explains, "Leave the presence of a fool, and you carry nothing away with you; after all your intercourse with him, you quit his presence without having gained any advance in true knowledge" (see on Proverbs 20:15). The LXX. presents a very different version: "All things are adverse to a foolish man; but wise lips are the arms of knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." A foolish man, by his inconsiderate, slanderous, or bitter words, makes every one his enemy; a wise man uses his knowledge to good purposes; his words are the instruments by which he shows what he is. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-8.htm">Proverbs 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">The wisdom of the prudent <i>is</i> to understand his way: but the folly of fools <i>is</i> deceit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way.</span> The wisdom of the prudent is shown by his considering whither his actions lead, the motives from which they spring, the results that attend them. As the apostle enjoins (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>), "See that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise." Or the clause may be taken as enjoining a wise choice in life, a selection of such a calling or occupation as best suits one's capabilities, station, and opportunities. <span class="cmt_word">The folly of fools is deceit.</span> This is not self-deceit, which the word does not denote, but deceit of others. Stupid persons show their folly in trying to cheat others, though they are sure to be detected, and their fraud recoils on themselves. In the case of fools, what they would call wisdom is folly; hence the wording of the sentence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous <i>there is</i> favour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fools make a mock at sin.</span> So the Vulgate (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>). Fools, wicked men, commit sin lightly and cheerfully, give specious names to grievous transgressions, pass over rebuke with a joke, encourage others in crime by their easy way of viewing it. But in the original the verb is in the singular number, while the noun is plural, and the clause could be translated as in the Authorized Version only with the notion that the number of the verb is altered in order to individualize the application of the maxim ('Speaker's Commentary'). But there is no necessity for such a violent anomaly. The subject is doubtless the word rendered "sin" (<span class="accented">asham</span>) which means both "sin" and "sin offering." So we may render, "Sin mocks fools," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> deceives and disappoints them of the enjoyment which they expected. Or better, as most in harmony with the following member, "The sin offering of fools mocks them" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a>). Thus Aquila and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> may signify "sin offering" (Ecclus. 7:31). It is vain for such to seek to win God's favour by ceremonial observances; offerings from them are useless expenditure of cost and trouble (<a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>). The Son of Sirach has well expressed this truth: "He that  sacrificeth of a thing unlawfully gotten, his offering is mockery (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), and the mockeries of unjust men are not well pleasing. The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the godless, neither is he propitiated for sin by the multitude of sacrifices" (Ecclus. 31:18, 19). It is always the disposition of the heart that conditions the acceptableness of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Among the righteous</span> <span class="cmt_word">there is favour</span> - the favour and good will of God, which are bestowed upon them because their heart is right. The word <span class="accented">ratson</span> might equally refer to the good will of man, which the righteous gain by their kindness to sinners and ready sympathy; but in that case the antithesis would be less marked. Septuagint, "The houses of transgressors owe purification (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); but the houses of the just are aceeptable." This is explained to signify that sinners refuse to offer the sacrifice which they need for their legal purification; but the righteous, while they have no necessity for a sin offering, are acceptable when they present their free will vows and thanksgivings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heart knoweth its own bitterness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the heart</span> (<span class="accented">leb</span>) <span class="accented">knoweth the bitterness of his soul</span> (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>). Neither our joys nor our sorrows can be wholly shared with another; no person stands in such intimate relation to us, or can put himself so entirely in our place, as to feel that which we feel. There is many a dark spot, many a grief, of which our best friend knows nothing; the skeleton is locked in the cupboard, and no one has the key but ourselves. But <span class="accented">we</span> can turn with confidence to the God-Man, Jesus, who knows our frame, who wept human tears, and bore our sorrows, and was in all points tempted like as we are, and who has taken his human experience with him into heaven. <span class="cmt_word">A stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy.</span> The contrast is between the heart's sorrow and its joy; both alike in their entirety are beyond the ken of strangers. St. Gregory remarks on this passage ('Moral.,' 6:23), "The human mind 'knoweth its own soul's bitterness' when, inflamed with aspirations after the eternal land, it learns by weeping the sorrowfulness of its pilgrimage. But 'the stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy,' in that he, that is now a stranger to the grief of compunction, is not then a partaker in the joy of consolation." A homely proverb says, "No one knows where the shoe pinches so well as he that wears it;" and an Italian maxim runs, "Ad ognuno par piu grave la croce sua" - "To every one his own cross seems heaviest." Septuagint, "The heart of man is sensitive (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>), his soul is sorrowful; but when it rejoices, it has no intermingling of insolence;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a man's mind is sensitive it is easily depressed by grief; but when it is elated by joy, it should receive its pleasure and relief without arrogance and ribaldry.

The text in its first sense probably means that sinners take great pains to increase their material prosperity, and to leave heirs to carry on their name and family, but Providence defeats their efforts: good men do their duty in their state of life, try to please God and benefit their neighbour, leaving anxious care for the future, and God prospers them beyond all that they thought or wished (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-33.htm">Proverbs 3:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flourish.</span> The word applies metaphorically to the growth, vigour, and increase of a family under the blessing of God.

But it seems better to take it as a warning against following a perverted or uninstructed conscience. Conscience needs to be informed by God's Word and ruled by God's will to make it a safe guide. When properly regulated, it is able to pronounce a verdict upon contemplated action, and its verdict must always he obeyed. But warped by prejudice, weakened by disuse and disobedience, judicially blinded in punishment and in consequence of sin, it loses all power of moral judgment, and becomes inoperative of good; and then, as to the way that seemed at the moment right, <span class="cmt_word">the end thereof are the ways of death</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-5.htm">Proverbs 5:5</a>).

St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:12) has some words on this subject: "There are times when we are ignorant whether the very things which we believe we do aright, are rightly done in the strict Judge's eye. For it often happens that an action of ours, which is cause for our condemnation, passes with us for the aggrandizement of virtue. Often by the same act whereby we think to appease the Judge, he is urged to anger when favourable  Hence, while holy men are getting the mastery over their evil habits, their very good practices even become an object of dread to them, lest, when they desire to do a good action, they be decoyed by a semblance of the thing, lest the baleful canker of corruption lurk under the fair appearance of a goodly colour. For they know that they are still charged with the burden of corruption, and cannot exactly discern the things that be good" (Oxford transl.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth <i>is</i> heaviness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful</span> (comp. ver. 10).

Virgil, 'AEneid,' 1:208, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And the end of that joy is bitterness;</span> it has in it no element of endurance, and when it is past, the real grief that it masked comes into prominence. In this mortal life also joy and sorrow are strangely intermingled; sorrow fellows closely on the steps of joy; as some one somewhere says, "The sweetest waters at length find their way to the sea, and are embittered there." Lesetre refers to Pascal, 'Pensees,' 2:1: "Tous se plaignent...de tout pays, de tout temps, de tous ages, et de toutes conditions. Une preuve si longue, si continuelle et si uniforme, devrait bien nous convaincre de l'impuissance ou nous sommes d'arriver au bien par nos efforts: mais l'exemple ne nous intruit point...  Le present ne nous satisfaisant jamais, l'esperance nous pipe, et, de malheur en malheur, nous meue jusqu'a la mort, qui en est le comble eternel. C'est une chose etrange, qu'il n'y a rien dans la nature qui n'ait ete capable de tenir la place de la fin et du bonheur de l'homme .... L'homme etant dechu de son etat naturel, il n'y arien a quoi il n'ait ete capable de so porter. Depuis qu'il a perdu le vrai bien, tout egalement peut lui paraitre tel, jusqu'a ea destruction propre, toute contraire qu'elle est a la raison et a la nature tout ensemble." This illustrates also ver. 12. Proverbs like "There is no rose without a thorn" are common enough in all languages. The Latins said, "Ubi uber, ibi tuber;" and "Ubi mel, ibi fel." Greek experience produced the gnome - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Sorrow and life are very near of kin."</span> Who Christian learns another lesson, "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>). The LXX. has introduced a negative, which gives a sense exactly contrary to the Hebrew and to all the other versions: "In joys there is no admixture of sorrow, but the final joy cometh unto grief." The negative has doubtless crept inadvertently into the text; if it were genuine, the sentence might be explained of the sinner's joy, which he finds for a time and exults in, but which does not last, and is felt to be a delusion as life closes.

Ecclus. 19:4, "He that is hasty to give credit is light minded, and he that sinneth (thus) shall offend against his own soul." It is often remarked how credulous are unbelievers in supernaturalism. They who refuse to credit the most assured facts of Christ's history will pin their faith on some philosophical theory or insufficiently supported opinion, and will bluster and contend in maintenance of a notion today which tomorrow will prove untenable and absurd.

In <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a> we had, "Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;" but here the idea is different. A wise man fears the evil that lurks in everything, and examines and ponders actions by the standard of religion, and is thus saved from many evils which arise from hastiness and inadvertence. <span class="cmt_word">The fool rageth, and is confident</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-26.htm">Proverbs 28:26</a>).

Revised Version, "beareth himself insolently, and is confident;" but, as Nowack remarks, the word (<span class="accented">mithabber</span>), where it occurs elsewhere, means, "to be excited," "to be in a passion" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21, 59, 62</a>), and this usual signification gives a good meaning here. Vulgate, <span class="accented">transilit</span>, "he overleaps" all laws and restrictions. The LXX., by transposition of the letters, reads <span class="accented">mithareh</span>, and translates <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>," The fool trusting to himself mixes himself up with sinners."

Such a one, in his haste and passion, does things which in calmer moments he must see are foolish and ridiculous.

Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:37 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ipse tibi moderare tuis ut parcere possis."</span> <span class="cmt_word">And a man of wicked devices is hated.</span> The contrast is not between the different ways in which the two characters are regarded, as that one is despised and ridiculed, and the other hated; but two kinds of evil are set forth in contradistinction, viz. hasty anger and deliberate plotting against others. Septuagint, "The irascible man (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) acts without deliberation. but the prudent man endureth much." The Hebrew term, "man of devices," being ambiguous, the LXX. takes it in a favourable sense, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and they have a different reading of the verb.

The LXX. regards the simple as communicating their folly to others, and translates, "Fools will divide malice." But the prudent are crowned with knowledge; put on knowledge as a crown of glory, in accordance with the Stoic saying, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "The wise is the only king." Nowack thinks the above translation and the idea alike belong to later times, and prefers to render, "The prudent embrace knowledge," which is parallel to the sentiment of ver. 6. The word is found only in <a href="../../par/psalms/142.htm">Psalm 142</a>:8, where it is translated either "shall compass me about" or "crown themselves through me." The Vulgate has <span class="accented">expectabunt, i.e.</span> "wait for it patiently," as the fruit of labour and perseverance.

The final victory of good over evil is here set forth. However triumphant for a time and apparently prosperous the wicked may be, their success is not lasting; they shall in the end succumb to the righteous, even as the Canaanite kings crouched before Joshua's captains (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>), and, hurled from their high estate, they shall stand humbly at the good man's door, begging for bread to support their life (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>). The contrast here indicated is seen in our Lord's parable of Dives and Lazarus, when the beggar is comforted and the rich man is tormented, and when the latter urgently sues for the help of the once despised outcast to mitigate the agony which he is suffering (comp. Wisd. 5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a></div><div class="verse">The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich <i>hath</i> many friends.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The poor is hated even of his own neighbour</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-4.htm">Proverbs 19:4, 7</a>). This sad experience of selfishness (comp.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a></div><div class="verse">He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy <i>is</i> he.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth.</span> Taken in connection with the preceding verse, this teaches that it is a sin to despise and shun a man because he is poor or of low estate; such a one has a claim for love and pity, and it is a crime to withhold them from him for selfish considerations. The Christian view is taught by the parable of the good Samaritan. <span class="cmt_word">But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he;</span> hail to him! (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). Contempt is contrasted with mercy, sin with blessing. "Blessed are the merciful," said Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>): "for they shall obtain mercy;" and St. Paul preserves another precious word, "It is mere blessed to give than to receive" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>). The merciful disposition, which shows itself in works of mercy, is a proof that the soul is in union with God, whose mercy is over all his works, whose mercy endureth forever, and therefore such a soul is blessed. "The poor," wrote James Howell, "are God's receivers, and the angels are his auditors" ('Five Hundred New Sayings'). The Vulgate here appends a line absent from the Hebrew and the ether versions, "He who believeth in the Lord loveth mercy." The true believer is charitable and bountiful, knowing that he will not hereby impoverish himself, but lay up a rich store of blessing; he acts thus not from mere philanthropy, but from higher motives: he has the grace of charity which springs from and rests upon his faith in God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a></div><div class="verse">Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth <i>shall be</i> to them that devise good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do they not err that devise evil?</span> or, <span class="accented">Will they not go astray</span>? The question is an emphatic mode of asserting the truth. They who meditate and practise evil (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>) go astray from the right way - the way of life; their views are distorted, and they no longer see their proper course. Thus the remorseful voluptuary bemoans himself, "We have erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction; yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it" (Wisd. 5:6, etc.), Mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. God's blessing will rest upon them. The combination of "mercy and truth" is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>; in Wisd. 3:9 and 4:15, and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a> we have "grace and mercy" (see note on Proverbs 3:3, where the two words occur in connection; and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>). The two graces in the text signify the love and mercy which God bestows on the righteous, and the truth and fidelity with which he keeps the promises which he has made. The Vulgate makes the two graces human, not Divine: "Mercy and truth procure blessings." The Septuagint renders, "The good devise mercy and truth." It adds a paraphrase not found in the Hebrew, "The devisers of evil know not mercy and faith; but alms and faith are with the devisers of good."

So in spiritual matters Christ teaches that they who think that prayer is heard for much speaking are mistaken; and he adds, "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a></div><div class="verse">The crown of the wise <i>is</i> their riches: <i>but</i> the foolishness of fools <i>is</i> folly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The crown of the wise is their riches.</span> This is taken by some ('Speaker's Commentary') to mean the glory of the wise man, the fame and splendour which surround him, constitute his wealth; but it is better to interpret it thus: Riches are an ornament to a wise man; they enhance and set off his wisdom in the eyes of others, enable him to use it to advantage, and are not the snare which they might be because they are employed religiously and profitably for the good of others. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, "Wisdom is good together with an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun." The Septuagint has, "The crown of the wise is the clever man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," for which has been substituted by some editors, in agreement with the present Hebrew text, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, " their wealth." The Greek translators, according to their reading, denote that one eminently clever man is a glory to the whole body of wise men. <span class="cmt_word">But the folly of fools is only folly;</span> that is, even though it were accompanied with riches. Decorate folly as you may, trick it out in gaud and ornament, it is still nothing but folly, and is discerned as such, and <span class="accented">that</span> all the more for being made conspicuous. Schultens, followed by Wordsworth, finds a play of words here. The words rendered "fool" and "folly" imply "fatness," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">crassus</span>, which have also this double meaning. So the sentence reads, "Riches are a crown to the wise; but the abundant fatness of fools is only fatness." The last clause is translated by the LXX., "But the fools' way of life (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;</span>) is evil." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 22:8) comments on this verse thus: "It was these riches of wisdom that Solomon having before his eyes, saith, 'The crown of the wise is their riches.' Which same person, because it is not metals of earth, but understanding, that he calls by the name of riches, thereupon adds by way of a contrary, 'But the foolishness of fools is imprudence.' For if he called earthly riches the crown of the wise. surely he would own the senselessness of fools to be poverty rather than imprudence. But whereas he added, 'the foolishness of fools is imprudence,' he made it plain that he called prudence 'the riches of the wise'" (Oxford tran cf.).

St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:33), "As in the way of the world fear gives rise to weakness, so in the way of God fear produces strength. In truth, our mind so much the more valorously sets at naught all the terrors of temporal vicissitudes, the more thoroughly that it submits itself in fear to the Author of those same temporal things. And being stablished in the fear of the Lord, it encounters nothing without it to fill it with alarm, in that whereas it is united to the Creator of all things by a righteous fear, it is by a certain powerful influence raised high above them all." Comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and St. Paul's words, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). Septuagint, "In the fear of the Lord is hope of strength." <span class="cmt_word">And his children shall have a place of refuge</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). There is an ambiguity as to whose children are meant. The LXX. renders, "And to his children he will leave a support." Thus many refer the pronoun to the Lord named in the first clause - God's children, those who love and trust him, and look up to him as a Father, an expression used more specially in the New Testament than in the Old. But see <a href="../../par/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>, and passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>) where God calls Israel his son, a type of all who are brought unto him by adoption and grace. Others, again, refer the pronoun to "the fear of the Lord," "its children," which would be quite in conformity with Hebrew idiom; as we have "sons of wisdom," "children of obedience," equivalent to "wise," "obedient," etc. But most modern commentators explain it of the children of the God-fearing man, comparing <a href="../../par/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>. Such a one shall confer lasting benefits upon his posterity (ch. 13:22; 20:7). So God blessed the descendants of Abraham and David; so he shows mercy unto thousands  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thousandth generation of them that love him and keep his commandments (see <a href="../../par/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-12.htm">1 Kings 11:12</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, etc.).

The fear of the Lord can he called a fountain of life, because, showing itself in obedience, it nourishes the flowers and fruits of faith, produces graces and virtues, and prepares the soul for immortality.

The reign of Solomon, the peaceful, gave an intimation that war and conquest were not a monarch's highest glory: that a happy and numerous people, dwelling securely and increasing in numbers, was a better honour for a king and more to be desired (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>). Increase of population is not, as some political economists would teach, in itself an evil; it is rather a sign of prosperity, and is in agreement with the primeval blessing, "Increase and multiply;" and though it may be hard to maintain the exact equilibrium between production and consumers, yet wise legislation can foresee and remedy the difficulty, the abundance in one part can supply the scarcity in another, the providence of God watching over all.

That organ, into which was breathed the breath of life (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is taken as the seat of the inward spirit, and as showing by exterior signs the dominant feeling. The original is very terse, "long in nostrils, great in understanding." A man's prudence and wisdom are displayed by his being slow to take offence and being patient under injury. <span class="cmt_word">He that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> flaunts it in the eyes of all men, makes plain exposure of it. Septuagint, "He who is short in temper is a mighty fool."

The word rendered "exalteth," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">marim</span>), occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>, and is taken by Delitzsch and Nowack in the sense of "carries away" as the assured result. "By anger," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78), "wisdom is parted with, so that we are left wholly in ignorance what to do, and in what order to do it.... Anger withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the mind."

Envy, like a canker, eats away a man's life and strength; it tells on his physical as well as his moral condition. We hays parallel expressions in classical authors. Thus Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:257 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis."</span> Martial, 'Epigr.,' 5:28 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Rubiginosis cuncta dentibus rodit;<br />Hominem malignum forsan esse tu credas,<br />Ego esse miserum credo, cui placet nemo."</span> Bengal proverb, "In seeing another's wealth it is not good to have the eyes smart." Arabic. "Envy is a raging fever, and has no rest" (Lane). "O invidia," cries St. Jerome ('Epist.,' 45), "primum mordax tui." "When the foul sore of envy corrupts the vanquished heart," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:85). "the very exterior itself shows how forcibly the mind is urged by madness. For paleness seizes the complexion, the eyes are weighed down, the spirit is inflamed, while the limbs are chilled, there is frenzy in the heart, there is gnashing with the teeth, and while the growing bate is buried in the depths of the heart, the pent wound works into the conscience with a blind grief" Septuagint, "A sensitive heart (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>) is a worm (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) in the bones."

"The poor shall never cease out of the land" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>); "The  poor ye have always with you," said Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>); therefore to harass and oppress the poor because he is in this lowly condition, is virtually to arraign the providence of God, who is the Father of all, and has made all men brothers, however differing in worldly position. Christ puts the duty of aiding the poor on the high ground of his solidarity with his people (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40, 45</a>), how that in ministering unto the least of these his brethren men are ministering unto him. "Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord" (Ecclus. 11:14).

In his very act of sin, <span class="accented">flagrante delicto</span>, the wicked is defeated, driven from hope and life; as the Revised Version renders, "The wicked is thrust down in his evil doing;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there is some element of weakness in an evil deed which occasions its discovery and punishment, sooner or later. Thus "murder will out," we say. But the contrast is better emphasized by taking <span class="accented">ra</span> in its other sense of "calamity," "misfortune," thus: "In his calamity the wicked is cast down" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). When misfortune comes upon him, he has no defence, no hope; he collapses utterly; all his friends forsake him; there is none to comfort or uphold him (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous hath hope in his death</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:13). Primarily, the clause means that even in the greatest danger the good man loses not his trust in God. It is like Job's word (if our reading is correct, <a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;" and the psalmist, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me" (<a href="../../par/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). Thus the Christian martyrs went joyfully to the stake, and gentle women and little children smiled on the sword which sent them home. It is natural to see in this clause a belief in a future life, and a state of rewards and punishments; and some commentators, holding that this doctrine was net known in pre-exilian days, have taken occasion from its plain enunciation in this paragraph to affix a very late date to our book. There are two answers to be made to this assertion. First, it is capable of proof that the belief in the immortality of the soul, with its consequences in another state, was held, however vaguely, by the Jews long before Solomon's time (see note, <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>); secondly, the present passage is by some read differently, whence is obtained another rendering, which removes from it all trace of the doctrine in question. Thus Ewald and others would read the clause in this way: "The righteous hath hope, or taketh refuge, from his own deeds." There can be no reasonable doubt that the usual reading and translation are correct; but the above considerations show that no argument as to the date of the Proverbs can be safely founded on this verse. The LXX. has a different reading for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>, "in his death," and translates, "But he who trusteth in his own holiness is just" - which looks like a travesty of Scripture, but probably refers to the consciousness of having a heart right with God and obedient to the requirements of the Divine Law.

Its more usual meaning is "mercy" or "piety;" hence some have explained the clause: "The piety of the peoples, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the worship of the heathen, is sin; and others, taking "sin" as put metonymically for "sin offering," render: "Piety is an atonement for the peoples." But there is no doubt that the Authorized Version is correct (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>). Thus Symmachus renders it by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "shame;" and in the same sense the Chaldee Paraphrase.

The sin of nations contrasted with the righteousness in the first clause must be injustice, impiety, and violence.

The wise man not only has knowledge, but can give it appropriate expression (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-23.htm">Proverbs 16:23</a>). Vulgate, "The tongue of the wise adorneth wisdom." The wise man, by producing his sentiments and opinions in appropriate language and on proper occasions, commends wisdom, and renders it acceptable to his hearers.

The LXX. renders the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> "are watching," as from a tower or high place.

Septuagint, "the healing of the tongue." But the Vulgate rendering is better, <span class="accented">lingua placabilis</span>, "the gentle, mild tongue" (see on Proverbs 14:30). Speech from such a source refreshes and vivifies all who come under its influence, like the wholesome fruit of a prolific tree (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The sick soul by a healing word is cured."</span> <span class="cmt_word">But perverseness therein</span> - in the tongue - <span class="cmt_word">is a breach in the spirit.</span> The perverseness intended must be falsehood, perversion of the truth. This is ruin and vexation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>, where the same word is used) in the spirit, both in the liar himself, whose higher nature is thus terribly marred and spoiled, and in the case of his neighbour, who is injured by his slander and falsehood to the, very core. The LXX., with a different reading, translates, "But he who keepeth it [the tongue] shall be filled with the spirit."

The Vulgate has here a distich which is not in the Hebrew, but a similar paragraph is found in the Septuagint. Thus Vulgate, "In the abundance of righteousness virtue is greatest; but the imaginations of the wicked shall be rooted up;" Septuagint, "In the abundance of righteousness is much strength; but the impious shall be destroyed from the very root." The addition seems to have been an explanation of the following verse, which has been foisted into the text here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-6.htm">Proverbs 15:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the house of the righteous is much treasure</span> (<span class="accented">chosen</span>; see on Proverbs 27:24). The good man's store is not wasted or wrongly used, and is blest by God: and therefore, whether absolutely much or little, it is safe, and it is sufficient. In a spiritual sense, the soul of the righteous is filled with graces and adorned with good works. Septuagint, "In the houses of the righteous is much strength;" <span class="accented">plurima fortitudo</span>, Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</span> Great revenues acquired by wrong or expended badly bring only trouble, vexation, and ruin upon a man and his family. Septuagint, "The fruits of the wicked shall perish." Spiritually, the works of the wicked cause misery to themselves and others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-7.htm">Proverbs 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge</span> (ver. 2; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>). The LXX. takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in its other signification of "binding" or "embracing," and translates, "The lips of the wise are bound (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) with knowledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knowledge is always on them and controls their movements. The wise know when to speak, when to be silent, and what to say. <span class="cmt_word">But the heart of the foolish doeth not so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doth not disperse knowledge. Vulgate, <span class="accented">cor stultorum dissimile erit</span>, "will be unlike," which probably means the same as the Authorized Version. (Compare a similar use of the words <span class="accented">lo-ken</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/48-18.htm">Genesis 48:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>.) But the contrast is stated rather weakly by this rendering, lips and heart having the same office to perform; hence it is better, with Delitzsch, Ewald, and others, to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>) as an adjective in the sense of "right" or "trustworthy," and either to supply the former verb, "disperseth that which is not right," or to render, "The heart of the foot  is not directed right;" the fool goes astray, and leads himself and others into error. Septuagint, "The hearts of fools are not safe (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord.</span> The costly sacrifice of the wicked is contrasted with <span class="cmt_word">the prayer</span>, unaccompanied with sacrifice, <span class="cmt_word">of the upright</span>. The first clause occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>, and virtually in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>. But in the latter passage the prayer of the wicked is denounced as abomination. Sacrifice, as legal and ceremonial, would be more naturally open to the charge of deadness and unreality; while prayer, as spontaneous and not legally enjoined, might be deemed less liable to for realism; all the more hateful, therefore, it is if not offered from the heart. The worthlessness of external worship without obedience and devotion of the heart is often urged by the prophets (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>; see also Ecclus. 31:18, etc.). The lesson was needed that the value of sacrifice depended upon the mind and disposition of the offerer, the tendency being to rest in the <span class="accented">opus operatum</span>, as if the external action was all that was necessary to make the worshipper accepted. This text was wrested by the Donatists to support their notion of the inefficacy of heretical baptism. St. Augustine replied that the validity of the sacrament depended not on the spiritual condition of the minister, but on the appointment of Christ. The text has also been applied to confirm the opinion that all the acts of unjustified man are sin. The truer view is that God's grace does act beyond the limits of his visible Church, and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit concurs with the free will of man before he is formally justified. The second clause recurs virtually in ver. 29.

"The way of life." the Vulgate calls it; so <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>. Ecclesiastes 21:6, "He that hateth reproof is in the way of sinners." The Authorized Version is quite allowable, and is supported in some degree by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Doctrina mala deserenti viam vitae.</span> The sinner is annoyed by discipline, correction, or true teaching, because they curb the indulgence of his passions, make him uneasy in conscience, and force him to look to future issues.

But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>).

"For," says St. Gregory ('Moral,' 12:44), "the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment.

"This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens....

Thus Euripides says ('Heracl.,' 387) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Zeus, the chastiser of too haughty thoughts."</span> <span class="cmt_word">But he will establish the border of the widow</span>. He will take the widow under his protection, and see that her landmark is not removed, and that her little portion is secured to her. The widow is taken as the type of weakness and desolation, as often in Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). In a country where property was defined by landmarks - stones or some such objects - nothing was easier than to remove these altogether, or to alter their position. That this was a common form of fraud and oppression we gather from the stringency of the enactments against the offence (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>). In the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions which have been preserved, there are many invoking curses, curious and multifarious, against the disturbers of boundaries. Such marks were considered sacred and inviolable by the Greeks and Romans (see Plato, 'De Leg.,' 8:842, 843; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639, etc.).

Revised Version, <span class="accented">pleasant words are pure.</span> Vulgate, "Speech pure and pleasant is approved by him" - which is a pharaphrase of the clause. Septuagint, "The words of the pure are honoured (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a></div><div class="verse">He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>). The special reference is doubtless to venal judges, who wrested judgment for lucre. Such malefactors were often reproved by the prophets (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>). But all ill-gotten gain brings sure retribution. The Greeks have many maxims to this effect. Thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> And again - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Riches ill won bring ruin in their train."</span> An avaricious man troubles his house in another sense. He harasses his family by niggardly economies and his domestics by overwork and underfeeding, deprives his household of all comfort, and loses the blessing of God upon a righteous use of earthly wealth. The word "troubleth" (<span class="accented">akar</span>, "to trouble") reminds one of the story of Achan, who, in his greed, appropriated some of the spoil of the banned city Jericho, and brought destruction upon himself and his family, when, in punishment of the crime, he and all his were stoned in  the Valley of Achor (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>). So the covetousness of Gehazi caused the infliction of the penalty of leprosy upon himself and his children (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>). Professor Plumptre ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) notes that the Chaldee Targum paraphrases this clause, referring especially to lucre gained by unrighteous judgments, thus: "He who gathers the mammon of unrighteousness destroys his house;" and he suggests that Christ's use of that phrase (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>) may have had some connection with this proverb through the version then popularly used in the Palestinian synagogues. <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth gifts shall live</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>). Primarily this refers to the judge or magistrate who is incorruptible, and gives just judgment, and dispenses his patronage without fear or favour; he shall "prolong his days" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>), And in all cases a man free from covetousness, who takes no bribes to blind his eyes withal, who makes no unjust gains, shall pass a long and happy life undisturbed by care. We see here a hope of immortality, to which integrity leads. The LXX., with the view of making the two clauses more marked in antithesis, restricts the application thus: "The receiver of gifts destroyeth himself; but he who hateth the receiving of gifts liveth." The Vulgate and Septuagint, after this verse, introduce a distich which recurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>. The Septuagint transposes many of the verses at the end of this chapter and the beginning of the next.

The Vulgate has "obedience," implying attention to the inward warnings of conscience and grace, before the mouth speaks. Poureth out (ver. 2). The wicked man never considers; evil is always on his lips and running over from his mouth. Septuagint, "The mouth of the ungodly answereth evil things." The LXX. here inserts ch. 16:7.

God is said to be "far" in the sense of not listening, not regarding with favour (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>). His attention to the righteous is seen in <a href="../../par/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18, 19</a>. The LXX. introduces here <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8, 9</a>.

The beaming glance that shows a pure, happy mind and a friendly disposition, rejoices the heart of him on whom it is turned. There is something infectious in the guileless, joyful look of a happy man or child, which has a cheering effect upon those who observe it. The LXX. makes the sentiment altogether personal: "The eye that seeth what is good rejoiceth the heart." <span class="cmt_word">A good report</span> (good tidings) <span class="cmt_word">maketh the bones fat;</span> strengthens them and gives them health (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>). Sight and hearing are compared in the two clauses, "bones" in the latter taking the place of "heart" in the former. The happy look and good news alike cause joy of heart.

The reproof, or instruction, of life is that which teaches the true way of pleasing God, which is indeed the only life worth living. The ear, by synecdoche, is put for the person. One who attends to and profits by such admonition may be reckoned among the wise, and rejoices to be conversant with them. Wordsworth finds a more recondite sense here: the ear of the wise dwells, lodges, passes the night (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>) in their heart, whereas the heart of fools is in their mouth (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>).

No knowledge, no discernment; no discernment, no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Before honour is humility</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-12.htm">Proverbs 18:12</a>). A man who fears  God must be humble, and as the fear of God leads to wisdom, it may be said that humility leads to the honour and glory of being wise and reckoned among the wise (ver. 31). A man with a lowly opinion of himself will hearken to the teaching of the wise, and scrupulously obey the Law of God, and will be blessed in his ways. For "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble" (<a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). The maxim in the second clause has a general application. "He that shall humble himself shall be exalted" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). It is sanctioned by the example of Christ himself, the Spirit itself testifying beforehand his sufferings that were to precede his glory (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "The fear of the Lord is discipline and wisdom, and the beginning of glory shall answer to it." Another reading adds, "Glory goeth before the humble," which is explained to mean that the humble set before their eyes the reward that awaits their humility, and patiently endure, like Christ, "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm"><title>Proverbs 16 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/16.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/16.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/16-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/15.htm" title="Proverbs 15">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 16 <a href="../proverbs/17.htm" title="Proverbs 17">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-1.htm">Proverbs 16:1</a></div><div class="verse">The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <i>is</i> from the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - These are specially religions maxims, and they all contain the name Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The Authorized Version makes one sentence of this verse without any contrast or antithesis.

In the case of Balaam, God overruled the wishes and intentions of the prophet, and constrained him to give utterance to something very different from his original mental conceptions.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath made all things for himself</span>. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter semetipsum</span>; and Origen ('Praef. in Job'), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. That is, God hath made everything for his own purpose, to answer the design which he hath intended from all eternity (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>). But this translation is not in accordance with the present reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which means rather "for its own end," for its own proper use. Everything in God's design has its own end and object and reason for being where it is and such as it is; everything exhibits his goodness and wisdom, and tends to his glory. Septuagint,  "All the works of the Lord are with righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span> This clause has been perverted to support the terrible doctrine of reprobation - that God, whose will must be always efficacious, has willed the damnation of some; whereas we are taught that God's will is that "all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth," and that "God sent his Son not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). Man, having freewill, can reject this gracious purpose of God, and render the means of salvation nugatory; but this does not make God the cause of man's destruction, but man himself. In saying that God "made the wicked," the writer does not mean that God made him as such, but made him as he made all other things, giving him powers and capacities which he might have used to good, but which, as a fact, he uses to evil. It will be useful here to quote the wise words of St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 6:33), "The Just and Merciful One, as he disposes the deeds of mortals, vouchsafes some things in mercy, and permits other things in anger; and the things which he permits he so bears with that he turns them to the account of his purpose. And hence it is brought to pass in a marvellous way that even that which is done without t,e will of God is not contrary to the will of God. For while evil deeds are converted to a good use, the very things that oppose his design render service to his design." <span class="accented">The day of evil</span> is the hour of punishment (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>), which by a moral law will inevitably fall upon the sinner. God makes man's wickedness subserve his purposes and manifest his glory, as we see in the case of Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>), and the crucifixion of our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>). It is a phase of God's moral government that an evil day should be appointed for transgressors, and it is from foreknowledge of their deserts that their punishment is prepared. The perplexing question, why God allows men to come into the world whom he knows will meet with perdition, is not handled here. Septuagint, "But the impious is kept for an evil day." Cato, 'Dist.,' 2:8 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nolo putes pravos homines peccata lucrari:<br />Temporibus peccata latent, sed tempore patent."</span>

The second member is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>, and must be taken as a form of adjuration. Septuagint, "Putting hands on hand unjustly, he shall not be innocent;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who acts violently and unjustly shall be held guilty - which seems a trite truism. Many commentators interpret the clause as if it meant that the cooperation and combination of sinners in evil practices will not save them from retribution. But hand clasping hand in token of completing a bargain or alliance is scarcely an early Oriental custom. There is an analogous saying in Greek which implies mutual assistance - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Hand washes hand, and finger finger."</span> The LXX. has here two distiches, the first of which occurs in the Vulgate, but the second is not found there. Neither appears in our present Hebrew text. "The beginning of the good way is to do what is just; this is more acceptable to God than to sacrifice sacrifices. He who seeketh the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness; and they who seek him rightly alkali find peace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged;</span> <span class="accented">atoned for.</span> The combination "mercy and truth" occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a> (where see note), and intimates love to God and man, and faithfulness in keeping promises and truth and justice in all dealings. It is by the exercise of those graces, not by mere external rites, that God is propitiated (see on Proverbs 10:2). A kind of expiatory value is assigned to these virtues, which, indeed, must not be pressed too closely, but should be examined by the light of such passages in the New Testament as <a href="../../par/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. Of course, such graces show themselves only in one who is really devout and God fearing; they are the fruits of a heart at peace with God and man, and react on the character and conduct. The LXX., which places this distich after ver. 27 of ch. 15, translates, "By alms and faithfulness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) sins are cleansed," confining the term "mercy" to one special form, as in one reading of <a href="../../par/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>. l, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [<span class="accented">al.</span> alms] before men." <span class="cmt_word">By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</span> The practice of true religion, of course, involves abstinence from sin; and this seems so unnecessary a truth to be formally stated  that some take the "evil" named to be physical, not moral evil; calamity, not transgression. But the two clauses are coordinate, and present two aspects of the same truth. The first intimates how sin is to be expiated, the second how it is to be avoided. The morally good man meets with pardon and acceptance, and he who fears God is delivered from evil. So we pray, in the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, and deliver us from evil." Septuagint, "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>).

Experience proves that nothing succeeds like success. Where a man is prosperous and things go well with him, even ill-wishers are content to east away or to dissemble their dislike, and to live at peace with him. Thus Abimelech King of Gerar fawned upon Isaac because he saw that the Lord was with him (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-27.htm">Genesis 26:27</a>, etc.). This is the worldly side of the maxim. It has a higher aspect, and intimates the far reaching influence of goodness - how it disarms opposition, arouses reverence and love, gives no occasion for disputes, and spreads around an atmosphere of peace. To the Jews the maxim was taught by external circumstances. While they were doing the will of the Lord, their land was to be preserved from hostile attack (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>). And Christians learn that it is only when they obey and fear God that they can overcome the assaults of the enemies of their soul - the devil, the world, and the flesh Talmud, "He who is agreeable to God is equally agreeable to men."

The word rendered "deviseth" implies, by its spectra, intensity of thought and care. Man meditates and prepares his plans with the utmost solicitude, but it rests with God whether he shall carry them to completion or not, and whether, if they are to be accomplished, it be done with ease or with painful labour (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12</a>, etc.).

It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man," cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (<a href="../../par/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>).

Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, "In the judgment his mouth should not err." The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them.

This surely is captious criticism. The maxim merely states that the trader's weights take their origin and authority from God's enactment, from certain eternal principles which he has established. What man's chicanery and fraud make of them does not come into view. (For the law that regulates such matters, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as <a href="../../par/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>.

The Septuagint, followed by some modern commentators, translates, "He who doeth wickedness is an abomination to kings;" but as the "righteousness" in the second clause (<span class="cmt_word">the throne is established by righteousness</span>) undoubtedly refers to the king, so it is more natural to take the "wickedness" in the first member as being his own, not his subjects'. When a ruler acts justly and wisely, punishes the unruly, rewards the virtuous, acts as God's vicegerent, and himself sets the example of the character which becomes so high a position, he wins the affection of his people, they willingly obey him. and are ready to die for him and his family (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>).

The LXX. translates, "The king's wrath is a messenger of death," taking the plural as put by enallage for the singular; but possibly the plural may intimate the many agents who are prepared to perform the ruler's behests, and the various means which he possesses for punishing offenders.

A haughty spirit - a lifting up of spirit - goeth before a fall (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29</a>, etc). Thus, according to Herodotus (7:10), Artabanus warned the arrogant Xerxes, "Seest thou how God strikes with the thunder animals which overtop others, and suffers them not to vaunt themselves, but the small irritate him not? And seest thou how he hurls his bolts always against the mightiest buildings and the loftiest trees? For God is wont to cut short whatever is too highly exalted" (comp.

The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint, "The man prudent in affairs is a finder of good things;" he attends to his business, and thinks out the best mode of accomplishing his plans, and therefore succeeds in a worldly sense (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he;</span> or, <span class="accented">hail to him</span>, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>. To heed the Word and to trust in the Lord are correlative things; handling a matter wisely can hardly belong to the same category. The Septuagint contrasts the worldly success of one who manages business wisely and discreetly with the blessedness of him who, when he has done all, commits his cause to God and trusts wholly to him: "He who hath trusted in the Lord is blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)."

People listen to instruction at the mouth of one who speaks well and winningly. Such a one augments knowledge in others, and  in himself too, for he learns by teaching. Knowledge ought not to be buried in one's own mind, but produced on fit occasions and in suitable words for the edification of others. Ecclus. 20:30, "Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>). Septuagint, "The wise and prudent they call worthless (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); but they who are sweet in word shall hear more." Wise men are called bad and worthless by the vulgar herd, either because they do not impart all they know, or because they are envied fear their learning; but those who are eloquent and gracious in speech shall receive much instruction from what they bear, every one being ready to converse with them anal impart any knowledge which they possess.

The possessor of understanding has in himself a source of comfort and a vivifying power, which is as refreshing as a cool spring to a thirsty traveller.

'Pirke Aboth,' 4:1, "Who is the hero? The man that restrains his thoughts." Maxims about self-mastery are common enough. Says an unknown poet, "Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, nec virtus altius ire potest." So Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 795, "Fortior est qui cupiditates suas, quam qui hostes subjicit." And the mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Linguam fraenare<br />Plus est quam castra domare."</span> At the end of this verse the Alexandrian Manuscript of the Septuagint, followed by later hands in some other uncials, adds, "and a man having prudence [is better] than a great farm." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a></div><div class="verse">The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot is cast into the lap.</span> The bosom or fold of the garment (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>). It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." <span class="cmt_word">The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</span> In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the <span class="accented">Sortes Virgilianae</span> or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, "For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things," which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm"><title>Proverbs 17 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/17.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/17.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/17-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/16.htm" title="Proverbs 16">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 17 <a href="../proverbs/18.htm" title="Proverbs 18">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a></div><div class="verse">Better <i>is</i> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <i>with</i> strife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - (Comp, <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Better</span> (sweeter) <span class="cmt_word">is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith.</span> Dry bread was soaked in wine or water before it was eaten. Thus Boaz bid Ruth "dip her morsel in the vinegar" (<a href="../../par/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>); thus Jesus gave the sop to Judas when he had dipped it (<a href="../../par/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). The Septuagint is pleonastic, "Better is a morsel with joy in peace." Aben Ezra connects this verse with the last two of ch. 16, confining the application to the patient man; but the sentence seems rather to be independent and general. <span class="cmt_word">Than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</span> Of the thank or peace offerings part only was burnt upon the altar, the rest was eaten by the offerer and his family; and as the victims were always the choicest animals, "a house full of sacrifices" would contain the materials for sumptuous feasting (see on Proverbs 7:4). The joyous family festival often degenerated into excess, which naturally led to quarrels and strife (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5, 6, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>, etc.). So the agapae of the early Church were desecrated by licence and selfishness (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "than a house full of many good things and unrighteous victims with contention." With this verse compare the Spanish proverb, "Mas vale un pedazo de pan con amor, que gallinas con dolor." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame.</span> Here is intimated the supremacy of wisdom over folly and vice. The contrast is better emphasized by translating, <span class="accented">A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that doeth shamefully</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a son of his master. (For similar contrast between "wise" and "shameful," comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-35.htm">Proverbs 14:35</a>.) Slaves were often raised to high honour, and might inherit their master's possessions. Thus Abraham's servant, Eliezer of Damascus, was at one time considered the patriarch's heir (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2, 3</a>); Ziba, Saul's servant, obtained the inheritance of his lord Mephibosheth ("the Shameful," <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>); Joseph was advanced to the highest post in Egypt. Ecclus. 10:25, "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service; and he that is wise will not grudge when he is reformed." Septuagint, "A wise household servant shall rule over foolish masters." "I have seen," says Ecelesiastes (Ecclesiastes 10:7), "servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren;</span> shall share on equal terms with the sons of the house. This innovation on the usual disposition of property could happen only in the case of an abnormally intelligent and trusted slave. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34</a>, etc., mention is made of a case where a master, having no son, gave his daughter in marriage to a slave, and adopted him into the family. Delitzsch understands the clause to mean that the slave shall have the office of dividing his master's inheritance among the heirs, shall be the executor of his deceased master's will; but this explanation hardly seems to do justice to the merits of the "wise servant," and takes no account of the idea involved in "shameful son." But the Septuagint appears to countenance this view, rendering, "and among the brethren he shall divide the portions."  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold.</span> The word <span class="accented">matsreph</span>, "fining pot," occurs also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21</a>. It is not certain what is meant by it. There is no evidence that the Israelites were acquainted with the use of acids in the manipulation of impure or mixed metals; otherwise the "pot" and the "furnace" would represent the two usual modes of reduction; but it is most probable that both allude to the same method of smelting the ore in crucibles, for the purpose of separating the pure metal from the dross. That silver and gold were plentiful in Solomon's time is abundantly evident; indeed, the amount of the precious metals collected by David and his son is almost incredible (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>, etc., from which and similar passages it is inferred that the sums enumerated equalled more than nine hundred millions of pounds sterling). <span class="cmt_word">But the Lord trieth the hearts</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>). That which fire does for the metals, the Lord does for men's hearts; he purifies them from dross, brings forth the good that is in them, purged from earthly infirmities. God's process is the application of sorrow, sickness, temptation, that, duly meeting these, the soul may emerge from the trial as pure gold, fit for the Master's use (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-3.htm">Jeremiah 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>).

One who is himself mendacious listens with avidity to any tale that may injure a neighbour. however monstrous and improbable it may be. Septuagint, "A wicked man listens to the tongue of transgressors; but a just man heedeth not false lips." The Greek adds here, or in some manuscripts, after ver. 6, a paragraph which is not found in the Hebrew, Syriac, or Latin: "To him who is faithful the whole world wealth belongs; but the unfaithful is not worth an obole." On this the Fathers have frequently commented (see Corn. a Lapide, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso mocketh the</span> <span class="cmt_word">poor</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>, which is nearly identical). <span class="cmt_word">He that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17, 18</a>). The particular calamity primarily intended seems to be that which reduces a person to poverty. Delight in others' misfortunes, even those of enemies, is a most detestable form of selfishness and malice. Job, testifying to his own integrity, was thankful to think that he was free from this vice (<a href="../../par/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>). The Greeks had a name for it, and called it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is used by Aristotle ('Eth. Nic.,' 2:6. 18). The pious author looks for retributive punishment on such spitefulness. The LXX. tries to improve the contrast by resorting a gloss, "He who rejoices at one who perishes shall not go unpunished; but he who hath compassion shall obtain mercy," which is remarkably like Christ's sentence, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."

"My son," says the rabbi in the Talmud, "avoid lying first of all; for a lie will tarnish the brightness of thy honour."

The gnome expresses the idea that a bribe is like a bright jewel that dazzles the sight and affects the mind of him who receives it (see on Proverbs 15:27; comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>).

Septuagint, "A reward of graces is discipline to those who use it;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> moral discipline brings an ample reward of graces to those who practise it. <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever it turneth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">it prospereth</span>. The Authorized Version refers these words to the gift. Delitzsch points out that the words are more properly taken of the person who receives the gift, so that they should be rendered, "Wheresoever he turneth himself he dealeth wisely." Inflamed by sordid hopes and the love of gain, he acts with all possible skill and prudence in order to work out his wages and show that he was rightly selected to receive the present. The verse merely states a common trait among unscrupulous men, and pronounces no judgment upon it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <i>very</i> friends.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that covereth a transgression seeketh love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strives to exercise, put in practice, love (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-4.htm">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>). Thus Nowack. One who bears patiently and silently, extenuates and conceals, something done or said against him, that man follows after charity, obeys the great law of love (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>). Some explain the clause to mean, "procures love for himself;" but the second member certainly is not personal, therefore it is more natural to take the first in a general sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that repeateth</span> (harpeth on) <span class="cmt_word">a matter separateth very friends</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>). He who is always dwelling on a grievance, returning to it and bringing it forward on every occasion, alienates the greatest friends, only embitters the injury and makes it chronic. Ecclus. 19:7, etc., "Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not. For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee. If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee." So the rabbis said: "Abstain from quarrels with thy neighbour; and if thou hast seen something bad of thy friend, let it not pass thy tongue as a slander" (Dukes, &sect; 61). The Mosaic Law had led the way to this duty of forbearance: "Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Septuagint, "He who concealeth injuries seeketh friendship; but he who hateth to conceal them separateth friends and households."

Hitzig quotes Sallust, 'Jug.,' 11, "Verbum in pectus Jugurthae altius, quam quisquam ratus est, descendit." Quint. Curt., 54:7, "Nobilis equus umbra quoque virgae regitur, ignavus ne calcari quidem concitari potest." The antithesis is put more forcibly in the Septuagint, "A threat breaks the heart of a prudent man; a fool even scourged feels it not." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An evil man seeketh only rebellion.</span> So the Greek and Latin Versions; but, as Nowack intimates, a bad man seeks many other things which do not come directly in the category of rebellion; and it is better to take <span class="accented">meri</span>, "rebellion," as the subject, regarding it as put for the concrete, thus: "A rebellious man striveth only for what is evil." From the point of view of an Eastern potentate, this is true enough. Absolute government looks upon any rising against constituted authority, any movement in the masses, as necessarily evil, and to be repressed with a high hand. Hence the succeeding clause. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span> The "cruel messenger" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>) is the executioner of the king's wrath (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-29.htm">1 Kings 2:29</a>, etc.). He is called "cruel" because his errand is deadly, and he is pitiless in its performance. This seems to be the sense intended. The LXX. gives a different notion, derived from the ambiguous term <span class="accented">malak</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: "The Lord will send forth a pitiless angel against him." The verse then becomes a statement concerning the retribution inflicted by God on obstinate sinners, such as Pharaoh and the Egyptians. These are delivered over to "the tormentors" (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>), the angels that execute the wrath of God, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6</a>, etc. As all sin is rebellion against God, it is natural to read into the passage a religious meaning, and for homiletical purposes it is legitimate to do so. But the writer's intention is doubtless as explained above, though his language may be divinely directed to afford a further application.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man.</span> The Syrian bear was once common throughout Palestine; it is now found in but few localities, such as the hills of Hermon and Lebanon, and in the hills east of the Jordan, the destruction of wood and forest having deprived these animals of the shelter necessary to their existence. The ferocity of the bear when deprived of its young had become proverbial (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>; Hart, 'Animals of the Bible,' 28, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Rather than a fool in his folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the paroxysm of his passion.

Oort supposes that this proverb arose from the riddle, "What is worse to meet than a bear?" Septuagint, "Care will fall upon a man of understanding; but fools imagine evils." The Greek translators take "bear" as us d metaphorically for terror and anxiety, but go far astray from the Hebrew text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso rewardeth evil for</span> <span class="cmt_word">good.</span> This was David's complaint of the churlish Nabal (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21</a>). Ingratitude shall surely he punished. <span class="cmt_word">Evil shall not depart from his house</span>. Terribly has the ingratitude of the Jews been visited. They cried in their madness, "His blood be on us and on our children!" and their punishment is still going on. Injunctions on this subject are frequent in the New Testament (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>). The Talmud says, "Do not throw a stone into the well whose waters you have drunk." The Greeks felt the sting of ingratitude.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water.</span> The small rift in the bank of a reservoir of water, if not immediately secured, is soon enlarged and gets beyond control, occasioning widespread ruin and destruction; so from small and insignificant causes, which might at first have been easily checked, arise feuds and quarrels which extend in a wide circle, and cannot be appeased. Palestine was largely dependent upon its reservoirs for the storage of water, perennial springs being of rare occurrence. The three pools of Solomon in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, which were connected by channels with Jerusalem, are still to be seen in all their massive grandeur; and, indeed, every town had its reservoir, or tank, as we find in India at the present time. These receptacles had to be kept in good repair, or disastrous consequences might ensue. On the tendency of a quarrel to grow to a dangerous extent, a Bengal proverb speaks of "going in a needle and coming out a ploughshare." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui dimittit aquam, caput est jurgiorum</span>, which seems to mean that the man who needlessly lets the water of a cistern run to waste gives occasion to quarrels. But St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:13), commenting on the passage, interprets differently: "It is well said by Solomon, 'He that letteth out water is a head of strife.' For the water is let out when the flowing of the tongue is let loose. And he that letteth out water is made the beginning of strife, in that, by the incontinency of the lips, the commencement of discord is afforded" (Oxford transl.). Probably, however, in the Latin, as in the Hebrew, the particle of comparison is suppressed, so that the clause means, "As he who lets out water, so is he who gives occasion to strife." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with</span>. The last word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is of doubtful interpretation. It occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a> and Proverbs 20:3, and is variously translated, "before it rushes forward," "before it grows warm," "before a man becomes wrathful." But Hitzig, Nowaek, and others take it to signify, "before men show their teeth," like angry dogs snarling at one another. The moralist advises men to subdue angry passions at once before they become exacerbated. The Vulgate seems to have quite mistaken the clause, translating, <span class="accented">Antequam patiatur contumeliam, judicium deserit</span>, which seems to mean that a patient, peace-loving man (in contrast with the irascible) avoids lawsuits before he is involved in a lasting quarrel. Septuagint, "The beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>) of justice gives power to words; but discord and contention lead the way to want." The Greek commentators see here an allusion to the clepsydra, the water clock which regulated the length of the speeches in a court of law; but the reference is by no means clear.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid prodest stulto habere divitias, cum sapientiam emere non possit</span>? The rabbis in later time were  not allowed to take fees for teaching; but it was customary to make offerings to seers and wise men, when their services were engaged or their advice was asked (see the case of Saul and Samuel, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>). The last clause gives the reason why it is useless for a fool to try to learn wisdom even at a large expenditure on teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he hath no heart to it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no capability for receiving it; his mental digestion cannot assimilate it. The heart, as we have already noticed, is regarded as the seat of the understanding. Thus the LXX., "Why doth a fool have wealth? for a man without heart cannot acquire wisdom." In the Gospel Christ calls his disciples "fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets had written, and himself opened their mind (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), that they might understand the Scriptures" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 45</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a distich derived from portions of vers. 19, 20, "He who raises his house high seeketh destruction; and he who perversely declineth from learning (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) shall fall into evils."

A real friend loves his friend in prosperity and adversity; yea, he is more than a friend in time of need - he is a brother, as affectionate and as trusty as one connected by the closest ties of relationship (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). Siracides gives a very cruel version of this proverb, "A friend cannot be known in prosperity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved; but in his adversity even a friend will depart" (Ecclus. 12:8, etc.). Cicero had a truer notion of the stability of friendship when he quoted Ennius's dictum, "Amicus certus in re incerta cernitur" ('De Amicit.,' 17.).

What is here censured is the weakness which, for the sake of perhaps worthless companions, lets itself be hampered and endangered by others' obligations. For, as our adage runs, he that is surety for another is never sure himself. The Septuagint takes the "striking of hands" to be a sign of joy (Vulgate, <span class="accented">plaudet manibus</span>), "The foolish man claps (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) and rejoices in himself, so also he who pledges himself for his friend."

He who builds a sumptuous house and lives in the way that his magnificent surroundings demand draws ruin on himself, either because he affects a state which he is unable to support, or acts so as to provoke reprisals and injurious consequences. The entrance to a Palestinian house would usually be of humble dimensions and sparse ornamentation; any doorway of great architectural pretensions would be uncommon, and would be regarded as a token of extraordinary wealth or reprehensible pride. Aben Ezra, taking "gate" as a metaphor for "mouth," explains the hemistich of the danger of random or excessive speech. This makes a good parallel with the first clause; but it is doubtful whether the words will bear this interpretation (see Hitzig); and the two clauses may present two forms of selfishness, captiousness and ostentation, both of which lead to quarrels and ruin (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).

A conceited, offensive fool causes infinite trouble to his father, both from his need of constant correction, and the watchfulness required to repair the consequences of his foolish actions.

For, as Job avows (<a href="../../par/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>), "Fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery." The LXX. adds, "The impious turns aside from the ways of righteousness."

"Silence," says the Sanskrit gnome, "is the ornament of the ignorant." "Talking comes by nature," say the Germans, "silence of understanding."

The Authorized Version gives, <span class="cmt_word">Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a man who has an earnest desire for self-improvement will hold himself aloof from worldly entanglements, and, occupying himself wholly in this pursuit, will become conversant with all wisdom. This gives good sense, and offers a contrast to the fool in ver. 2, who "hath no delight in understanding." But the Hebrew does not rightly bear this interpretation. Its conciseness occasions ambiguity. Literally, <span class="accented">For his desire a man who separates himself seeks</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> (or <span class="accented">against</span>)  <span class="accented">all wisdom he mingles himself.</span> There is a doubt whether the life of isolation is praised or censured in this verse. Aben Ezra and others of Pharisaic tendencies adopt the former alternative, and explain pretty much as the Authorized Version, thus: "He who out of love of wisdom divorces himself from home, country, or secular pursuits, such a man will mix with the wise and prudent, and be conversant with such." But the maxim seems rather to blame this separation, though here, again, there is a variety of interpretation. Delitzsch, Ewald, and others translate, "He that dwelleth apart seeketh pleasure, against all sound wisdom he showeth his teeth" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>). Nowack, after Bertheau, renders, "He who separates himself goes after his own desire; with all that is useful he falls into a rage." Thus the maxim is directed against the conceited, self-willed man, who sets himself against public opinion, delights in differing from received customs, takes no counsel from others, thinks nothing of public interests, but in his mean isolation attends only to his own private ends and fancies (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate (followed by Hitzig) read in the first clause, for <span class="accented">taavah</span>, "desire<span class="accented"></span>," <span class="accented">taanah</span>, "occasion;" thus: "He who wishes to separate from a friend seeks occasions; but at all time he will be worthy of censure." The word translated "wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyah</span>) also means "substance," "existence;" hence the rendering, "at all time," <span class="accented">omni existentia</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">omni tempore.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool hath no delight in understanding.</span> This may mean that he takes no pleasure in the wisdom of others, is self-opinionated; or, it may be, does not care for understanding in itself, apart from the use which he can make of it. Vulgate, "The fool receives not the words of wisdom;" Septuagint, "A man of no sense has no need of wisdom." To try to teach a fool is to cast pearls before swine, and to give that which is holy unto dogs. <span class="cmt_word">But that his heart may discover itself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his only delight is in revealing his heart, displaying his un-wisdom and his foolish thoughts, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>. He thinks that thus he is showing himself superior to others, and benefiting the world at large. The LXX. gives the reason, "For rather by folly he is led." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-3.htm">Proverbs 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">When the wicked cometh, <i>then</i> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt.</span> The contempt here spoken of is not that with which the sinner is regarded, but that which he himself learns to feel for all that is pure and good and lovely (<a href="../../par/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>). As the LXX. interprets, "When the wicked cometh into the depth of evil, he despiseth," he turns a despiser. So the Vulgate. Going forward in evil, adding sin to sin, he end by casting all shame aside, deriding the Law Divine and human, and saying in his heart, "There is no God." St. Gregory, "As he who is plunged into a well is confined to the bottom of it; so would the mind fall in, and remain, as it were, at the bottom, if, after having once fallen, it were to confine itself within any measure of sin. But when it cannot be contented with the sin into which it has fallen, while it is daily plunging into worse offences, it finds, as it were, no bottom to the well into which it has fallen, on which to rest. For there would be a bottom to the well, if there were any bounds to his sin. Whence it is well said, 'When a sinner hath come into the lowest depth of sins, he contemneth.' For he puts by returning, because he has no hope that he can be forgiven. But when he sins still more through despair, he withdraws, as it were, the bottom from the well, so as to find therein no resting place" ('Moral.,' 26:69, Oxford transl.). Even the heathen could see this terrible consequence. Thus Juvenal is quoted ('Sat.,' 13:240, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nam quis<br />Peccandi finem posuit sibi? quando receipt<br />Ejectum semel attrita de fronte ruborem?<br />Quisnam hominum est, quem tu contentum videris uno<br />Flagitio?"</span> <span class="cmt_word">And with ignominy cometh reproach.</span> Here again it is not the reproach suffered by the sinner that is meant (as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>), but the abuse which he heaps on others who strive to impede him in his evil courses. All that he says or does brings disgrace, and he is always ready to revue any who are better than himself. Both the Septuagint and the Vulgate make the wicked man the victim instead of the actor, thus: "but upon him there cometh disgrace and reproach." The Hebrew does not well admit this interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-4.htm">Proverbs 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">The words of a man's mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters, <i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters.</span> "Man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>) here means the ideal man in all his wisdom and integrity, just as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a> the ideal wife is intended under the general term "wife." Such a man's words are as deep waters which cannot be fathomed or exhausted. The metaphor is common (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:24</a>; Ecclus. 21:13). For "mouth," the Septuagint reads "heart:" "Deep water is a word in a man's heart." The second hemistich explains the first: <span class="cmt_word">The well spring of wisdom as a flowing</span> (<span class="accented">gushing</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>brook</span>. A man's words are now called a well spring of wisdom, gushing forth from its source, the wise and understanding heart, pure, fresh, and inexhaustible. Septuagint, "And it leapeth  forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) a river and a fountain of life." Or we may, with Delitzsch, take the whole as one idea, and consider that a man's words are deep waters, a bubbling brook, and a fountain of wisdom.

The Authorized Version reminds one of the mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Lingua susurronis<br />Est pejor felle draconis."</span> The verse recurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-22.htm">Proverbs 26:22</a>; but the word rendered "wounds" (<span class="accented">mitlahamim</span>) is to be differently explained. It is probably the hithp. participle of <span class="accented">laham</span>," to swallow," and seems to mean "dainty morsels," such as one eagerly swallows. Thus Gesenius, Schultens, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others. So the clause means, "A whisperer's words are received with avidity; calumny, slander, and evil stories find eager listeners." The same metaphor is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>. There may, at the same time, be involved the idea that these dainty morsels are of poisonous character. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Verba bilinguis, quasi simplicia</span>, "The words of a man of double tongue seem to be simple," which contains another truth. <span class="cmt_word">They go down into the innermost parts of the belly</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27, 30</a>). The hearers take in the slanders and treasure them up in memory, to be used as occasion shall offer. The LXX. omits this verse, and in its place introduces a paragraph founded partly on the next verse and partly on <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>. The Vulgate also inserts the interpolation, "Fear overthrows the sluggish; and the souls of the effeminate (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) shall hunger."

"Brother" is used as "companion" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>), for one of like attributes and tendencies; as we say, "next door to;" and the destroyer is, as Nowack says, not merely one who wastes his property by reckless expenditure, but one who delights in such destruction, finds a morbid pleasure in haves and ruin. So the maxim asserts that remissness in duty is as mischievous as actual destructiveness. "An idle brain," say the Italians, "is the devil's workshop." The word rendered "great" is <span class="accented">baal</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), "owner," <span class="accented">patrono</span> (Montanus), <span class="accented">domino</span> (Vatablus); and, taking this sense, according to Wordsworth and others, the sentence implies that the servant who is slothful is brother to a master who is a prodigal. But the interpretation given above is best founded. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span> instead of, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span>, renders, "He who healeth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) himself in his works is brother to him who destroyeth himself."

"Thou hast been a Shelter  for me," says the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>), "and a strong Tower from the enemy." The words bring before us a picture of a capitol, or central fortress, in which, at times of danger, the surrounding population could take refuge. Into this Name we Christians are baptized; and trusting in it, and doing the duties to which our profession calls, with faith and prayer, we are safe in the storms of life and the attacks of spiritual enemies. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous runneth into it</span> (the tower), <span class="cmt_word">and is safe;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is set on high</span>; <span class="accented">exaltabitur</span>, Vulgate; he reaches a position where he in set above the trouble or the danger that besets him. Thus St. Peter, speaking of Christ, exclaims (<a href="../../par/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>), "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." "Prayer," says Tertullian ('De Orat.,' 29), "is the wall of faith, our arms and weapons against man who is always watching us. Therefore let us never go unarmed, night or day. Under the arms of prayer let us guard the standard of our Leader; let us wait for the angel's trumpet, praying." Septuagint, "From the greatness of his might is the Name of the Lord; and running unto it the righteous are exalted."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-14.htm">Proverbs 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity.</span> That high property or faculty of man called "spirit" enables the body to bear up against trouble and sickness (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The influence of the mind over the body, in a general sense, is here expressed. But taking "spirit" in the highest sense, in the trichotomy of human nature, we see an intimation that the grace of God, the supernatural infusion of his presence, is that which strengthens the man and makes him able to endure with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But a wounded</span> (<span class="accented">broken</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>spirit who can bear?</span> The body can, as it were, fall back upon the support of the spirit, when it is distressed and weakened; but when the spirit itself is broken, grieved, wearied, debilitated, it has no resource, no higher faculty to which it can appeal, and it must succumb beneath the pressure. Here is a lesson, too, concerning the treatment of others. We should be more careful not to wound a brother's spirit than we are to refrain from doing a bodily injury; the latter may be healed by medical applications; the former is more severe in its effects, and is often irremediable. In the first clause, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> "spirit," is masculine, in the second it is feminine, intimating by the change of gender that in the former case it is a manly property, virile moral quality, in the latter it has become weakened and depressed through affliction. Septuagint, "A prudent servant soothes a man's wrath; but a man of faint heart (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) who will endure?" The LXX. take "spirit" in the sense of anger, and "infirmity" as standing for a servant, though whore they find "prudent" is difficult to say. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Spiritum vero ad irascendum facilem, quis poterit sustinere</span>? The Latin interpreter takes one form of weakness of spirit, viz. irascibility, as his interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, "wounded." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78) has yet another version, "Who can dwell with a man whose spirit is ready to wrath?" adding, "For he that does not regulate his feelings by the  reason that is proper to man, must needs live alone like a beast." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/18-15.htm">Proverbs 18:15</a></div><div class="verse">The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The first clause is similar to <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-14.htm">Proverbs 15:14</a>; the second gives a kind of explanation of the former - the understanding of the wise man is always expanding and increasing its stores, because his ear is open to instruction, and his ability grows by wholesome exercise (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>). <span class="accented">Daath</span>, "knowledge," which is used in both clauses, the LXX. translates by two words, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>.

Some consider it to mean a bribe offered for underhand or fraudulent purposes; but the context does not lead to this conclusion, and the parallel passage mentioned above makes against it. Hitzig sees in it a spiritual gift, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; but such a meaning is not elsewhere attached to the word. The term here signifies the present which duty or friendship offers to one whom one wishes to please. This paves a man's way to a great person's presence. <span class="cmt_word">Bringeth him before great men.</span> The Oriental custom of offering suitable gifts to one in authority, when a favour or an audience is desired, is here alluded to (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). So the Magi brought gifts so the newborn King at Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>). In a spiritual sense, the right use of riches opens the way to eternal life, evincing a man's practical love of God and man; as Christ says (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>), "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (Revised Version).

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justus prior est accusator sui.</span> So Septuagint, "The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)." He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on <a href="../../par/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, "To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'" (so lib. 22:33).

The lot, being considered to show the judgment of God, settled the question. <span class="cmt_word">And parteth between the mighty.</span> If it were not for the decision by lot, persons of eminence and power would settle their differences by violent means.

Aristotle also writes thus ('De Republ.,' 7:7): "If men receive no return from those to whom they have shown kindness, they deem themselves, not only defrauded of due gratitude, but actually injured. Whence it is said, 'Bitter are the quarrels of friends;' and, 'Those who love beyond measure also hate beyond measure.'" An English maxim gloomily decides, "Friendship once injured is forever lost." Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:4), "Ut adamas, si frangi contingat malleis, in minutissimas dissidit crustas, adeo ut vix oculis cerni queant: ita arctissima necessitudo, si quando contingat dirimi, in summam vertitur simultatem, et ex arctissimis foederibus, si semel rumpantur, maxima nascuntur dissidia." Ecclus. 6:9, "There  is a friend, who being turned to enmity will also discover thy disgraceful strife," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will disclose the quarrel which according to his representation will redound to thy discredit. The Vulgate and Septuagint have followed a different reading from that of the present Hebrew text: "Brother aided by brother is like a strong and high city, and he is powerful as a well founded palace," Septuagint. The last clause is rendered in the Vulgate. <span class="accented">Et judicia quasi vectes urbium</span>; where <span class="accented">judicia</span> means "lawsuits," legal disputes; these bar out friendship. The first member of the sentence in the Greek and Latin recalls <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>, etc., "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour," etc. St. Chrysostom, commenting on <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> ('Hom.,' 9.), writes, "A glorious bond is this; with this bond let us bind ourselves together alike to one another and to God. This is a bond that bruises not, nor cramps the hands it binds, but it leaves them free, and gives them ample play and greater energy than those which are at liberty. The strong, if he be bound to the weak, will support him, and not suffer him to perish; and if again he be tied to the indolent, he will rather rouse and animate. 'Brother helped by brother,' it is said, 'is as a strong city.' This chain no distance of place can interrupt, neither heaven, nor earth, nor death, nor anything else, but it is more powerful and stronger than all things."

It seems to be a further explanation of the statement in the text, founded on the practice prevalent at the time when the Septuagint Version was composed, which appears to have made divorce a recognized necessity in the case of adultery: "He who casteth away a good a wife casteth away good things; but he who retaineth an adulteress is a fool and impious." The advice of Siracides concerning a wicked wife is austere: "If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh" (Ecclus. 25:26). Nothing is here said about the marriage of divorced persons; but the absolute indissolubility of the marriage bond was never held among the Jews, a certain laxity being allowed because of the hardness of their heart  (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>, etc.).

The Codex Venetus Marcianus (23, Holmes and Parsons) is the only uncial that contains them. <span class="cmt_word">The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</span> The irony of the passage is more strongly expressed by Siracides: "The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also" (Ecclus. 13:3). The rich man not only does wrong, but accompanies the injury with passionate language and abuse, as if he were the sufferer; while the poor man has humbly to ask pardon, as if he were in the wrong. Thus the Roman satirist writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Libertas pauperis haec est:<br />Pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat,<br />Ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Juv., 'Sat.,' 3:299.</span>) Aben Ezra explains the verse as denoting that a poor man making a submissive request from a rich man is answered cruelly and roughly. The hardening effect of wealth is seen in our Lord's parables of Dives and Lazarus (<a href="../../par/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>), and the Pharisee and the publican (<a href="../../par/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>).

In the present reading of the second clause, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, there seems to be a failure in antithesis, unless we can understand the fool as a rich fool. This, the repetition of the maxim in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a> ("Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich"), would lead one to admit. The Vulgate accordingly has, <span class="accented">Quam dives torquem labia sua, et insipiens</span>, "Than a rich man who is of perverse lips and a fool." With this the Syriac partly agrees. So that, if we take this reading, the moralist says that the poor man who lives a guileless, innocent life, content with his lot, and using no wrong means to improve his fortunes, is happier and better than the rich man who is hypocritical in his words and deceives others, and has won his wealth by such means, thus proving himself to be a fool, a morally bad man. But if we content ourselves with the Hebrew text, we must find the antithesis in the simple, pious, poor man, contrasted with the arrogant rich man, who sneers at his poor neighbour as an inferior creature. The writer would seem to insinuate that there is a natural connection between poverty and integrity of life on the one hand, and wealth and folly on the other. He would assent to the sweeping assertion, <span class="accented">Omnis dives ant iniquus aut iniqui heres</span>, "Every rich man is either a rascal or a rascal's heir."

At first sight it looks as if some verse, to which this one was appended, had fallen out; but there is no trace in the versions of any such loss. We have had a verse beginning in the same manner (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>), and here it seems to emphasize what follows - folly is bad, so is ignorance, when the soul lacks knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a man does not know what to do, how to act in the circumstances of his life, has in fact no practical wisdom. Other things "not good" are named in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>. And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth; misseth his way. Delitzsch confines the meaning of this hemistich to the undisciplined pursuit of knowledge: "He who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray," because he is neither intellectually nor morally clear as to his path or object. But the gnome is better taken in a more general sense. The ignorant man, who acts hastily without due deliberation, is sure to make grave mistakes, and to come to misfortune. Haste is opposed to knowledge, because the latter involves prudence and circumspection, while the former blunders on hurriedly, not seeing whither actions lead. We all have occasion to note the proverbs, <span class="accented">Festina lente</span>; "More haste, less speed." The history of Fabius, who, as Ennius said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shows the value of deliberation and caution.

But the sense is rather, "He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid." Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,<br />Qua solatus es adlocutione?<br />Irascor tibi.

The Hebrew is literally, "Seeking words, they are not" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which makes the clause signify, "He who pursues words, they are to him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: "He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered." Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the  original reading, "He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape." That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>; <span class="accented">Qui autem possessor est mentis, diligit animam suam, et custos prudentiae inveniet bona."</span>

"Wisdom" is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">leb.</span> "heart;" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "loveth himself." The contrary, "hateth his own soul," occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a>. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth understanding shall find</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits.

Such a life is ruin to a fool. who knows not how to use it properly; it confirms him in his foolish, sinful ways. A man needs religion and reason to enable him to bear prosperity advantageously, and these the fool lacks. "Secundae res," remarks Sallust ('Catil.,' 11), "sapientium animos fatigant," "Even wise men are wearied and harassed by prosperity," much more must such good fortune try those who have no practical wisdom to guide and control their enjoyment. Vatablus explains the clause to mean that it is impossible for a fool, a sinner, to enjoy peace of conscience, which alone is true delight. But looking to the next clause, we see that the moralist is thinking primarily of the elevation of a slave to a high position, and his arrogance in consequence thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span> By the unwise favouritism of a potentate, a slave of lowly birth might be raised to eminence and set above the nobles and princes of the land. The writer of Ecclesiastes gives his experience in this matter: "I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>). The same anomaly is mentioned with censure (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a> and Ecclus. 11:5). What is the behaviour of unworthy persons thus suddenly raised to high position has formed the subject of many a satire. It is the old story of the "beggar on horseback." A German proverb declares, "Kein Scheermesser scharfer schiest, als wenn der Bauer zu Herrn wird." Claud., 'In Eutrop.,' 181, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Asperius nihil est humili, quum surgit in altum;<br />Cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet; desaevit in omnes,<br />Ut se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ulla<br />Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis."</span> As an example of a different disposition, Cornelius a Lapide refers to the history of Agathocles. Tyrant of Syracuse, who rose from the humble occupation of a potter to a position of vast power, and, to remind himself of his lowly origin, used to dine off mean earthenware. Ausonius thus alludes to this humility ('Epigr.,' 8.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Fama est fictilibus coenasse Agathoclea regem,<br />Atque abacum Samio saepe onerasse luto;<br />Fercula gemmatis cum poneret horrida vasis,<br />Et misceret opes pauperiemque simul.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">Quaerenti causam, respondit: Rex ego qui sum<br />Sicaniae, figulo sum genitore satus<br />Fortunam reverenter habe, quicunque repente<br />Dives ab exili progrediere loco."</span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a></div><div class="verse">The king's wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion,</span> which inspires terror, as preluding danger and death. The same idea occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4, 8</a>). The Assyrian monuments have made us familiar with the lion as a type of royalty; and the famous throne of Solomon was ornamented with figures of lions on each of its six steps (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>, etc.). Thus St. Paul. alluding to the Roman emperor, says (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>), "I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." "The lion is dead," announced Marsyas to Agrippa, on the decease of Tiberius (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:06, 10). The mondist here gives a monition to kings to repress their wrath and not to let it rage uncontrolled, and a warning to subjects not to offend their ruler, lest he tear them to pieces like a savage beast, which an Eastern despot had full power to do. <span class="cmt_word">But his favour is as dew upon the grass</span>. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a> the king's favour was compared to a cloud of the latter rain; here it is likened to the dew (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>). We hardly understand in England the real bearing of this comparison. "The secret of the luxuriant fertility of many parts of Palestine," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 1:72, etc.), "lies in the rich supply of moisture afforded by the seawinds which blow inland each night, and water the face of the whole land. There is no dew, properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dewdrops by the coolness of the night, as in a climate like ours. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard; and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse.... To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands The amount of moisture thus poured on the thirsty vegetation during the night is very great. Dew seemed to the Israelites a mysterious gift of Heaven, as indeed it is. That the skies should be stayed from yielding it was a special sign of Divine wrath, and there could be no more gracious conception of a loving farewell address to his people than where Moses tells them that his speech should distil as the dew. The favour of an Oriental monarch could not be more boneficially conceived than by saying that, while his wrath is like the roaring of a lion, his favour is as the dew upon the grass." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (ration), "favour," is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">hilaritas</span>, "cheerfulness" (as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>), which gives the notion of a smiling, serene, benevolent countenance as contrasted with the angry, lowering look of displeased monarch.

The word for "poor" is here <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on vers. 1 and 4). It is a beautiful thought that by showing mercy and pity we are, as it were, making God our debtor; and the truth is wonderfully advanced by Christ, who pronounces (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>), "Inasmuch as ye have done it mite one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (see on Proverbs 11:24; 28:27). St. Chrysostom ('Hom.,' 15, on <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>), "To the more imperfect this is what we may say, Give of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith he, 'He that giveth unto the poor lendeth unto God.' But if you are in a hurry, and wait not for the time of retribution, think of those who lend money to men; for not even these desire to get their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the repayment be secure, and they have no mistrust of the borrower. Let this be done, then, in the present case also. Leave them with God, that he may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But he gives even here also; for, 'Seek ye,' saith he, 'the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.' Well, then, let us look towards that kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind, but is such as is meet to be given by God.

Ecclus. 32(35):10, etc., "Give unto the Most High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten give with a cheerful eye.

The Turk says, "What you give in charity in this world you take with you after death. Do good, and throw it into the sea if the fish does not know it, God does."

The word for "kindness" is <span class="accented">chesed</span>, "mercy;" and, looking to the context, we see the meaning of the maxim to be that a poor man's desire of aiding a distressed neighbour, even if he is unable to carry out his intention, is taken for the act of mercy. "The desire of a man" may signify a man's desirableness, that which makes him to be desired or loved; this is found in his liberality. But the former explanation is most suitable. Septuagint, "Mercifulness is a gain unto a man," which is like ver. 17; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Homo indigens misericors est</span>, taking a man's desire as evidenceing his need and poverty, and introducing the idea that the experience of misery conduces to pity, as says Dido (Virgil, 'AEn.,' 1:630) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco."</span> <span class="cmt_word">A poor man is better than a liar.</span> A poor man who gives to one in distress his sympathy and good wishes, even if he can afford no substantial aid, is better than a rich man who promises much and does nothing, or who falsely professes that he is unable to help (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27, 28</a>).

In <a href="../../par/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7, 8</a> it is used of the prophetic predictions of Balaam; certain didactic psalms, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a> and Psalm 78:2, are so designated, and in Job (<a href="../../par/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a> and Job 29:1) it describes the sententious discourses of wise men. While all these come under the generic term of <span class="accented">m'shalim</span>, though few or no comparisons are found in them, we find the term <span class="accented">mashal</span> sometimes used of what are proverbs in the sense of popular sayings. Compare "Therefore it became a proverb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), Is Saul also among the prophets?" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>); and see also other instances in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a> and Ezekiel 18:2. In this sense it is also found in the collection before us. The predominant idea of the term, however, is that of comparison or similitude, and as such it is better represented by the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> (from  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, "to set or place side by side"), literally, a placing beside, or comparison, than by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "a byword," or "a trite wayside saying," though in the Greek of the synoptic Gospels <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The English word "proverb" insufficiently renders the wider scope of meaning conveyed in the Hebrew <span class="accented">mashal</span>, and is not quite accurately rendered here, since of proverbs in our ordinary signification of that word there are comparatively few in this collection. The Hebrew word here means "maxims," "aphorisms," "wise counsels." <span class="accented">Of Solomon.</span> Most modern commentators (Delitzsch, Zockler, Fuerst, Stuart, Plumptre, etc.), while attributing, in a greater or less degree, the authorship of the book to Solomon, regard the insertion of his name in the title as indicating rather that he is the dominant spirit among those wise men of his age, some of whose sayings are here incorporated with his own. <span class="cmt_word">King of Israel</span>, as forming the second hemistich of the verse, goes with "Solomon," and not "David." This is indicated in the Authorized Version by the position of the comma. The Arabic Version omits allusion to David, and reads, "Proverbia, nempe documenta Salomonis sapientis, qui regnavit super filios Israel." The proverbial or parabolic form of teaching was a recognized mode of instruction among the Hebrews, and in the Christian Church is recommended by St. Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' lib. 11, <span class="accented">init.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom and instruction.</span> In this verse we have a statement of the first general aim or object of the Proverbs. "To know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ladaath</span>) is somewhat indefinite in the Authorized Version, and might be more accurately rendered. "from which men may know" (De Wette, Noyes); cf. <span class="accented">unde scias</span> (Munsterus). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> which is here prefixed to the infinitive, as in vers. 2, 8, and 6, gives the clause a final character, and thus points out the object which the teaching of the Proverbs has in view. The teaching is viewed from the standpoint of the learner, and hence what is indicated here is not the imparting of knowledge, but the reception or aprrspriation thereof on the part of the laemer. Schultens states that the radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">daath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the reception of knowledge into one's self. <span class="accented">Wisdom.</span> It will be necessary to go rather fully into this word here on its first appearance in the text. The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">khokhmah</span>). Wisdom is mentioned first, because it is the end to which all knowledge and instruction tend. The fundamental conception of the word is variously represented as either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "power of judging," derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, "to be wise," from the Arabic, "to judge" (Oesenlus); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the fixing of a thing for cognition," derived from the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, as before, which signifies "to fasten" (Zockler), or "compactness," from the same root as before, "to be firm, or closed." It is also variously defined <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "<span class="accented">insight</span> into that upright dealing which pleases God - a <span class="accented">knowledge</span> of the right way which is to be followed before God, and of the wrong one which is to be shunned" (Zockler); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as "piety towards God," as in <a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> (Gesenius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as "the knowledge of things in their being and in the reality of their existence" (Delitzsch), The word is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">sapientia.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">khokhmah</span> and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> so far agree as philosophical terms in that the end of each is the same, viz. the striving after objective wisdom, the moral fitness of things; but the character of the former differs from that of the latter in being distinctly religious. The beginning and the end of the <span class="accented">khokhmah</span>, wisdom, is God (cf. ver. 7). Wisdom, then, is not the merely scientific knowledge, or moral philosophy, but knowledge <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> religious knowledge or piety towards God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an appreciation of what God requires of us and what we conversely owe to God. "Sapientia est de divinis" (Lyra). Wisdom will, of course, carry with it the notions of knowledge and insight. <span class="accented">Instruction.</span> As the preceding word represents wisdom in its intellectual conception, and has rather a theoretical character, so "instruction," Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), represents it on its practical side, and as such is its practical complement. The Hebrew <span class="accented">musar</span> signifies properly "chastisement," from the root <span class="accented">yasar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "to correct," or "chastise," and hence education, moral training; and hence in the LXX. it is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, which means both the process of education (cf. Plato, 'Repub.,' 376, E.; Arist., 'Pol.,' 8, 3) and its result as learning (Plato, 'Prob.,' 327, D.). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">disciplina.</span> In relation to wisdom, it is antecedent to it; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to know wisdom truly we must first become acquainted with instruction, and hence it is a preparatory step to the knowledge of wisdom, though here it is stated rather objectively. The words, "wisdom and instruction," are found in exactly the same collocation in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a> and Proverbs 23:23. In its strictly disciplinary sense, "instruction" occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>, with which comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>. Holden takes this word as "moral discipline" in the highest sense. <span class="cmt_word">To perceive the words of understanding;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to discern the words of discernment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to comprehend the utterances which proceed from intelligence, and give expression to  it" (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">vinah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), connected with the hiph. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">l'havin</span>), properly "to distinguish," hence "to discern," of the same clause, signifies the capability of discerning the true from the false, good front bad, etc. With this agrees Cornelius a Lapide, who says, "Unde prudenter discernas inter bonum et malum, licitum et illicitum, utile et noxium, verum et falsum," and from which you are enabled to know what to do in any circumstances, and what not to do. The LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">prudentia.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato and Aristotle, is the virtue concerned in the government of men, manage-merit of affairs, and the like (see Plato, 'Sym.,' 209, A.; Arist.,' Eth.,' N. 6, 5 and 8), and means practical wisdom, prudence, or moral wisdom. Van Ess, Allioli, Holden, translate "prudence." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To receive the instruction of wisdom.</span> This verse carries on the statement of the design of the Proverbs. <span class="accented">To receive</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">lakakhath</span>), not the same word as "to know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 2, though regarded as synonymous with it by Delitzsch. Its meaning is well represented by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Authorized Version "to receive." The Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, is infinitive, and means properly "to take, or lay hold of," hence "to receive," Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, No doubt it conveys the idea of intellectual reception (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">The instruction of wisdom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">musar has'kel</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the discipline or moral training which leads on to reason, intelligence, or wisdom (as Hitzig, Fuerst, Zockler); or discipline full of insight, discernment, or thoughtfulness (as Umbreit, Ewald, Delitzsch). The phrase does not mean the wisdom which instruction imparts. The <span class="accented">word musar</span> occurs here in a slightly different sense from its use in ver. 2; there it is objective, here its meaning as a medium for the attainment of wisdom is more distinctly brought out. <span class="accented">Wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">haskel</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> properly "thoughtfulness" (so Umbreit. Ewald, Delitzsch, Plumptre). It is strictly the infinitive absolute of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">sakal</span>), "to entwine or involve," and as a substantive it stands for the thinking through of a subject, so "thoughtfulness." The LXX. renders this sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, which St. Jerome understands as "versutias sermonum et solutiones aenigmatum" ("the cunning or craftiness of words and the explication of enigmas"). <span class="cmt_word">Justice, and judgment, and equity.</span> These words seem to be the unfolding of the meaning contained in the expression, "the instruction of wisdom." Holden regards the last four words as objective genitives dependent on "instruction," but wrongly. Cornelius a Laplde states that "justice and judgment and equity" indicate the same thing in different aspects. "<span class="accented">Justice</span> stands for the thing itself - that which is <span class="accented">just</span>; <span class="accented">judgment</span> in respect of right reason, which says it is just; and <span class="accented">equity</span> in respect of its being agreeable to the Law of God." <span class="accented">Justice</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsadak</span>), "to be right, or straight;" in a moral sense it means "rectitude," "<span class="accented">right</span>," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> (Gesenius). The underlying idea is that of straightness. Heidenheim, quoted by Delitzsch, maintains that in <span class="accented">tsedek</span> the conception of the <span class="accented">justum</span> prevails; but the latter enlarges its meaning, and holds that it also has the idea of a mode of thought and action regulated, not by the letter of the Law, but by love, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. Plumptre thinks "righteousness" would be a better translation of the word, on the ground that the Hebrew includes the ideas of truth and beneficence. Compare with this the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Zockler also renders "righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is in accord with the will and ordinances of God as Supreme Judge." In the Authorized Version, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, where we have the same collocation of words, <span class="accented">tsedek is</span> translated "righteousness;" cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>, "He who utters truth shows forth righteousness (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>)." <span class="accented">Judgment</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">mish'pat</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shapat</span>), "to adjust, judge," corresponds with the Hebrew in meaning; it is the delivery of a correct judgment on human actions. Compare the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">Equity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rectitude in thought and action (Delitzsch), or integrity (Zockler). This quality expresses upright demeanour or honoumble action on one's own part individually, while "judgment" has regard both to our own and the actions of others. The Hebrew, <span class="accented">mesharim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), used only in the plural, is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>), "to be straight or even," and is equal to "uprightness." The plural form is reproduced in the marginal reading "equities;" comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>, "Let thine eyes beheld the things that are equal (<span class="accented">mesharim</span>)." The Vulgate reads <span class="accented">aequitas</span> and the Syriae <span class="accented">rectitudo.</span> The two ideas in judgment and equity appear to be expressed in the LXX. by the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>.

We have this idea expressed as follows in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, "The prudent man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">arum</span>) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself." In the Arabic Version it is rendered by <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, "shrewdness," in a good sense. The Hebrew <span class="accented">ar'mah</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, also means "craftiness," as appears in the use of the cognate adjective <span class="accented">arum</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where we read, "The serpent was more subtle," etc. For "subtilty" the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a Greek word which appears to be employed altogether in a bad sense, as "trickery," "villainy," "knavery;" but that scarcely appears to be the meaning of the Hebrew here, since the aim of the Proverbs is ethical and beneficial in the highest degree. The Vulgate <span class="accented">astutia</span>, the quality of the <span class="accented">astutus</span>, beside the bad sense of craftiness, also boars the good sense of <span class="accented">shrewdness</span>, sagacity, and so better represents the Hebrew. "Subtilty may turn to evil, but it also takes its place among the highest moral gifts" (Plumptre). <span class="accented">The simple</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ph'thaim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">p'ti</span>) from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">pathakh</span>), "to be open," properly means the open-hearted, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who are susceptible to external impressions (Zockler), and so easily misled. The word occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-18.htm">Proverbs 14:18</a>; and Proverbs 27:12. The LXX. properly renders the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "unknowing of evil." The same idea is indirectly expressed in the Vulgate <span class="accented">parvuli</span>, "the very young;" and the term is paraphrased in the Arabic Version, <span class="accented">iis in quibus non est malitia</span> ("those who are without malice"). The Hebrew here means "simple" in the sense of inexperienced. <span class="cmt_word">To the young man knowledge and discretion.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">naar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) is here used representatively for "youth" (cf.

The principle here enunciated is again stated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>, "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser," and finds expression under the gospel economy in the words of our Lord, "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; cf. 25:29; <a href="../../par/mark/4-25.htm">Mark 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a> and Mark 14:26). <span class="accented">Learning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">lekakh</span>), in the sense of being transmitted or received (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Dunn). A man of understanding (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">intelligens</span>) is a person of intelligence who lays himself open to be instructed. <span class="accented">Wise counsels</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">takh'buloth</span>). This word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khevel</span>), a ship rope, a denominative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khovel</span>), and only occurs in the plural. It signifies those maxims of prudence by which a man may direct his course aright through life (cf. <span class="accented">regimen</span>, Arabic). The imagery is taken from the management of a vessel, and is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">gubernatio.</span> "Navigationi vitam comparat" (Mariana).

In the only other passage where it is found it is used of God's power in turning about the clouds; cf. <a href="../../par/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, "And it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bright cloud] is turned round about by his counsels (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">b'thakh'bulothau</span>)." It is the practical correlative of "learning," in the first part of the verse.

The end of the wise and intelligent man's increase in learning and prudence is that he may be thus enabled to understand other proverbs.

It is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this word. By Gesenius it is rendered "enigma, riddle;" by Bertheau and Hitzig, "discourse requiring  interpretation:" by Delitzsch, "symbol; by Havernick and Keil, "brilliant and pleasing discourse;" and by Fuerst, "figurative and involved discourse." By comparing it with the corresponding words, "dark sayings," it may be regarded as designating that which is obscure and involved in meaning; compare <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.). It only occurs here and in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, where it is rendered "taunting proverb." The marginal reading is "an eloquent speech," equivalent to <span class="accented">facundia</span>, "eloquence."

In the latter they are described as "goads and as nails fastened by the ministers of assemblies" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "authors of compilations," as Mendelssohn), because they cannot fail to make an impression on everybody good or bad. The expression, as used in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, implies that other than Solomonic proverbs are included in this collection. <span class="cmt_word">And their dark sayings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">v'khidotham</span>).

It plainly has the sense of "enigma" (Fleischer, apud Delitzsch). Compare <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">aenigmata</span> (Vulgate), which latter is followed by the Chaldea Paraphrase and Syriac (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter <span class="accented">dark sayings</span> of old"). Gesenius derives it from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">khud</span>), "to tie knots," and hence arrives at its meaning as an involved or twisted sententious expression, an <span class="accented">enigma.</span>

INTRODUCTORY SECTION. The first main section of the book begins here and ends at <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>. It consists of a series of fifteen admonitory discourses addressed to youth by the Teacher and Wisdom personified, with the view to exhibit the excellence of wisdom, and generally to illustrate the motto, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge," or wisdom. It urges strong encouragements to virtue, and equally strong dissuasives from vice, and shows that the attainment of wisdom in its true sense is the aim of all moral effort. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.</span> This proposition is by some commentators regarded as the motto, symbol, or device of the book (Delitzsch, Umbreit, Zockler, Plumptre). Others, following the Masoretic arrangement of the Hebrew text, consider it as forming part of the superscription (Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, Keil). As a general proposition expressing the essence of the philosophy of the Israelites, and from its relation to the rest of the contents of this book, it seems rightly to occupy a special and individual position. The proposition occurs again in the Proverbs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and it is met with in similar or slightly modified forms in other books which belong to the same group of sacred writings, that is, those which treat of religious philosophy - the Khokhmah; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; Ecclus. 1:16, 25. With this maxim we may compare "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a>). <span class="accented">The fear of the Lord</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">yir'ath y'hovah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the fear of Jehovah.</span> The expression describes that reverential attitude or holy fear which man, when his heart is set aright, observes towards God. The original word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">yir'ath</span>) for "fear," is properly the infinitive of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, (<span class="accented">yare</span>), "to fear or reverence," and as a substantive means "reverence or holy fear" (Gesenius). <span class="accented">Servile</span> or abject fear (as Jerome, Beda, Estius) is not to be understood, but <span class="accented">filial</span> fear (as Gejerus, Mercerus, Cornelius a Lapide, Cartwright), by which we fear to offend God - that fear of Jehovah which is elsewhere described as "to hate evil" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and in which a predominating element is love. Wardlaw remarks that the "fear of the Lord" is in invariable union with love and in invariable proportion to it. We truly fear God just in proportion as we truly love him. The fear of the Lord also carries with it the whole worship of God. It is observable that the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is used in the Hebrew, and not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), a peculiarity which is invariably marked in the Authorized Version by small capitals. <span class="accented">The beginning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">reshith</span>). This word has been understood in three different senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As <span class="accented">initium</span>, the beginning; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the initial step or starting point at which every one who wishes to follow true wisdom must begin (Gejerus, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As <span class="accented">caput</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the most excellent or principal part, the noblest or best wisdom. This sense is adopted in the marginal reading (comp. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>) (Holden, Trapp). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> As the <span class="accented">principium</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the origin, or basis, as in <a href="../../par/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>, "She is the origin, or basis (<span class="accented">reshith</span>) of the sin of the daughter of Zion." Delitzsch regards the original, <span class="accented">reshith</span>, as embracing the two ideas of commencement and origin, in the same way as the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>. Wisdom has its origin in God, and  whoever fears him receives it if he prays in faith (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, sqq.) (Vatablus, Mercerus, Delitzsch). That the first sense, viz. that of beginning, is to be understood here appears from the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>, where the corresponding word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>. (<span class="accented">t'killath</span>), "beginning," from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khalal</span>), "to begin;" cf. also the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, in this sense, and the <span class="accented">initium</span> of the Syriac and Arabic Versions. All previous knowledge to "the fear of the Lord" is comparative folly. He who would advance in knowledge must first be imbued with a reverence or holy fear of God. But <span class="cmt_word">fools despise wisdom and instruction;</span> or, according to the inverted order of the words in the original, <span class="accented">wisdom and instruction fools despise</span>, the association of ideas in the three words, "knowledge," "wisdom," and "instruction," thus being more continuously sustained. This arrangement links on the two latter words with "the fear of the Lord," and so helps towards the elucidation of the sense in which "fools" is to be understood <span class="accented">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">evilim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">evil</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">aval</span>), "to be perverse," here properly designates the incorrigible, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>, and those who are unwilling to know God (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>), and hence refuse and despise wisdom and salutary discipline, those "who set at nought all his counsel, and will none of his reproof." The word is opposed to the "prudent" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>) and to the "wise" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>). Delitzsch understands it as "thick, hard, stupid," from the <span class="accented">root aval, coalescere, incrassari.</span> Schultens uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">erassi pro stupidis</span>, to represent the original. Dunn takes it in the same sense as "gross or dull of understanding." Fuerst, adopted by Wordsworth, regards it in the sense of having no moral stamina, from the root meaning "to be slack, weak, lax, or lazy." But none of these explanations seems, in my opinion, to coincide sufficiently with the evil and depraved activity expressed in the verb "despise," which follows, and which describes the conduct of this class. The LXX. renders the word or action by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">impii</span>, "godless," "profane," and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">stulti. Despise</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">bazu</span>) is perfect, but is properly translated by the present, because the perfect here represents a condition long continued and still existing (Gesenius, &sect; 126); cf. the Latin <span class="accented">odi</span>, <span class="accented">memini</span>, etc. The LXX. uses the future <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they will set at nought; the Vulgate, the present (<span class="accented">despiciunt</span>). The radical meaning is most probably contemptuous trampling under the feet (Geseuius). <span class="accented">Wisdom and instruction</span> (see ver. 2). The latter clause of this verse is antithetical to the former, but the antithesis is obscurely expressed. In the Authorized Version it is marked by the adversative conjunction "but," which, however, is not in the original. The LXX. has a striking interpolation in this verse between the first and second clauses, which is partly taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "And a good understanding have all they that do it: and reverence towards God is the beginning of knowledge"). Compare the Arabic Version, which has the same interpolation: <span class="accented">Et intellectus bonus onmibus facientibus eam. Sana religio in Deum est initium prudentiae.</span>

The transition in this verse from what may be regarded as filial obedience towards God to filial obedience towards parents is suggestive of the moral Law. The same admonition, in a slightly altered form, occurs again in ch. 6, "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother" (cf. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>). <span class="accented">My son</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), "a son." The form of address here adopted was that in common use by teachers towards their pupils, and marks that superintending, loving, and fatherly care and interest which the former felt in and towards the latter. It occurs frequently in the introductory section (<a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-1.htm">Proverbs 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>), and reappears again towards the close (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15, 19, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-11.htm">Proverbs 27:11</a>) in the teacher's address. The mother of Lemuel uses it (<a href="../../par/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>) in the strictly parental sense. In other passages of the Old Testament the teacher, on the other hand, is represented as a "father" (<a href="../../par/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a> <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-21.htm">2 Kings 2:21</a>). We find the same relation assumed in the New Testament, both by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>) and by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a>); but under the economy of the gospel it has a deeper significance than here, as pointing to the "new birth," which, being a later revelation, lies outside the scope of the moral teaching of the Old Testament dispensation. <span class="accented">The instruction</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">musar</span>); as carrying with it the sense of disciplinary education (cf.

The nature of the exhortation conveyed in this verse requires that we should understand the terms "father" and "mother" in their natural sense as designating the parents of the persons addressed,  though a symbolical meaning has Been attached to them by the rabbis (see Rabbi Salomon, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), "father" being understood as representing God, and "mother," the people. But the terms are more than merely figurative expressions (Stuart). Those who look upon the Proverbs as the address of Solomon to his son Rehoboam naturally take "father" as standing for the former. Naamah, in this case must be the mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It is almost unnecessary to state that pious parents are presupposed, and that only that instruction and law can be meant which is not inconsistent with the higher and more perfect Law of God (Gejerus, Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="accented">Forsake.</span> The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">tittosh</span>) is that of "spreading," then of "scattering" (Aiken), and so the word comes to mean "forsake, reject, or neglect." The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">abjicere</span>, "to push away, reject." Cf. <span class="accented">abjicias</span> (Arabic). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">dimittas, i.e.</span> "abandon," and the Syriac, <span class="accented">obliviscaris, i.e.</span> "forget." <span class="accented">The law</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">torath</span>), construct case of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">yarah</span>), "to teach," hence here equivalent to "a law" in the sense of that which teaches - a precept (<span class="accented">doctrina</span>, Jun. et Tremell., Piscat., Castal., Versions). With one exception (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>), it is the term which always expresses the instruction given by Wisdom (Delitzsch). The law (<span class="accented">torah</span>) of the mother is that preceptive teaching which she imparts orally to her son, but <span class="accented">torah</span> is also used in a technical sense as <span class="accented">lex</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, that which is laid down and established, a <span class="accented">decretum</span> or <span class="accented">institutum</span>, and designates some distinct provision or ordinance, as the law of sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-7.htm">Leviticus 6:7</a>). In <a href="../../par/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> we find it employed to signify the whole body of the Mosaic Law (<span class="accented">sepher hatorah</span>)<span class="accented">. Mother.</span> Not inserted here as a natural expansion of the idea of the figure required by the laws of poetic parallelism (as Zockler), since this weakens the force of the passage. Mothers are mentioned because of their sedulousness in imparting instruction (Bayne). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they</span> (shall be) <span class="cmt_word">an ornament of grace unto thy head.</span> The sentiment here expressed is put forward as an inducement to youth to observe obedience towards the instruction of the father and the law of the mother, and the meaning is that, just as in popular opinion ornaments and jewels are supposed to set off the personal form, so obedience towards parents in the ways of virtue embellishes the moral character (Bayne, Cartwright, Holden). <span class="accented">An ornament</span> <span class="accented">of grace</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yath khen</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a wreath or garland of grace</span>. We meet with the same expression in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>, "She [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom] shall give to thine head an ornament of grace." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lavah</span>), "to wind a roll" (Delitzsch) or "to be joined closely with" (Gesenius), and hence signifies an ornament that is twisted, and so a wreath or garland. Gejerus and Schultens translate the phrase by <span class="accented">corolla gratiosa, i.e.</span> "a crown full of grace," and so meaning conferring or producing grace, just as the expression, "the chastisement of our peace" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), means the chastisement bringing or procuring our peace. So again a "precious stone," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>, margin, "a stone of grace," is one conferring gracefulness. The marginal reading, "an adding" (<span class="accented">additamentum</span>, Vatablus), conveys, though obscurely, the same idea; and this sense is again reproduced in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut addatur gratia capiti suo</span> ("in order that grace may be added to thy head"). The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">Chains</span>; properly, <span class="accented">necklaces</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anakim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">anak</span>), "a cellar or necklace;" the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or "golden collar," of the LXX., and <span class="accented">torques</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> twisted neckchain) of the Vulgate. There is a very apposite parallel to this verse in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20, 21</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; see also <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>). The gold chain round the neck was a mark of distinction, and was conferred on Joseph by Pharaoh when investing him with authority and dignity (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), and on Daniel by Belshazzar in the same way (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; see <a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>). The mere adornment of the person with gold and pearls, without the further adornment of the moral character with Christian graces, is deprecated both by St. Paul and St. Peter (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>). <span class="accented">Neck</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gar'g'roth</span>) only occurs in the plural (Gesenius).

This sense agrees with the Vulgate <span class="accented">abscondamus tendiculas</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us conceal snares." Delitzsch, however, holds that no word is to be understood with this verb, and traces the radical meaning to that of restraining one's self, watching, lurking. in the sense of <span class="accented">speculari</span>, "to watch for," <span class="accented">insidiari</span>, "to lay wait for." The two verbs combine what may be termed the apparatus, the arrangement of the plot and their lurking in ambush, by which they will await their victims. <span class="accented">For blood</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">l'dam</span>). The context (see vers. 12 and 16), bearing as it does upon bloodshed accompanying robbery, requires that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'dam</span>) should be understood here, as Fleischer remarks, either elliptically, for "the blood of men," as the Jewish interpreters explain, or synedochically, for the person, with especial reference to his blood being shed, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>. Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide. and Gesenius support the latter view (cf. <a href="../../par/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, "They all lie in wait for blood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for bloodshed, or murder. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">dam</span>) may be also taken for life in the sense that "the blood is the life" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause.</span> The relation of the phrase. "without cause" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">khinnam</span>), in this sentence is a matter of lnueh dispute.

On the analogy of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>, it seems preferable to adopt the first connection, and to take the adverb with the verb. In the whole of the passage there is an evident allusion to an evil  prevalent in the age of Solomon, viz. the presence of bands of robbers, or banditti, who disturbed the security and internal peace of the country. In the New Testament the same state of things continued, and is alluded to by our Lord in the parable of the man who fell among thieves.

The enticement here put before youth is the courage and boldness of their exploits (Wardlaw). The order of the words in the original is, "Let us swallow them up, as the grave, living," which sufficiently indicates the meaning of the passage. <span class="accented">Alive</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> "the living," refers to the pronomiual suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">niv'laem</span>), as in the Authorized Version and Zockler (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a>).

The <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) with a substantive, as here in <span class="accented">kish'ol</span>, is a preposition, said not a conjunction (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon'). It denotes a kind of resemblance, but does not introduce a coordinate sentence. The allusion is undoubtedly in the teacher's mind to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), and as in that case "the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up" in the flush of life, so here the robbers say that they will as suddenly and effectively destroy their victims, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">dala</span>); from which <span class="accented">niv'laem</span>, in a figurative sense, means "to destroy utterly" (Geseuius).

The all-devouring and insatiable character of sheol is described in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "Hell (<span class="accented">sheol</span>) and destruction are never full," and again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, where it (<span class="accented">sheol</span>, Authorized Version, "the grave") is classed with the four things that are never satisfied. Vulgate, <span class="accented">infernus</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. And whole, as those that go down into the pit.

The word is used in an ethical signification in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>.

The robbers, by drawing a comparison between themselves and Hades and the grave, which consign to silence all who are put therein, imply their own security against detection. They will so utterly destroy their victims that none will be left to tell the tale (see Musset, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). This, we know, is a fancied, and at the best only a temporary, security.

A short cut to wealth, and to the acquirement of that which costs others long years of steady application and carefulness, is a strong inducement (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">We shall find</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nim'tza</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">matza</span>), properly "to reach to," and "to find," in the sense of "to come upon;" cf.

The collocation of the ideas of lightness and heavineess in these two words is striking, but we need not necessarily suppose that any oxymoron is intended, as Schnltens.

It here signifies the common stock, the aggregate of the gains of the robbers contributed to a common fund. The booty captured by each or any is to be thrown into one common stock, to form one purse, to be divided by lot among all the members of the band. On this community of goods among robbers, compare the Hebrew proverb, <span class="accented">In localis, in poculis, in ira.</span> Community of goods among the wicked carries with it community in crime, just as the community of goods among the early Christians implied community in good works and in the religious sentiments of the Christian body or Church. The Rabbi Salomon Isacides offers another explanation (which leaves the choice open to youth either to share in the spoil by lot, or to live at the expense of a common fund, as he may prefer): "Si voles, nobiscum spolia partieris, si etiam magis placebit, sociali communique marsupio nobiscum vives" - "If thou wilt, thou shalt share with us the booty; ay, if it like thee more, thou halt live with us on a confederate and common purse" (see Cornelius a Lapide).

At once the youth who listens will be hurried along impetuously to the two crimes of robbery and murder, which God has expressly forbidden in the eighth and sixth commandments respectively of the moral code. <span class="accented">Evil</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is "wickedness," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, generally, but here more specifically highway robbery, latrocinism (Cornelius a Lapide), as appears from vers. 11-13, where also murder, the laying in wait for blood, is proposed. The Rabbis Salomon and Salazar understand the evil to refer to the evil or destruction  which sinners bring upon themselves, and the shedding of blood to the fact that they lay themselves open to have their own blond shed by judicial process (see also Holden). The former explanation seems preferable to this, as putting a higher law than that of self-preservation before youth. The fear of judges who can condemn to death is notbing comparatively to the fear of him "who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell." This verse is wanting in the Vatican LXX., and Arabic, and hence Hitzig has concluded that it is an interpolation made from <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, but upon insufficient evidence, as it is found in the Alexandrian LXX., Chaldea Paraphrase, Vulgate, and Syriac Versions, all which follow the Hebrew text.

So sinners, when they are plotting for others, plunge into their own destruction with their eyes open.

This view is supported by the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For not unreasonably is the net spread before birds;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they fall into the snare (see Luther, Patrick, Umbreit, Ewatd, Hitzig, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others, as Delitzsch, Ziegler, Beda, Doderlein, Bertheau, Wardlaw, take <span class="accented">khinnam</span> in a different sense, as indicating the escape of the birds - the birds see the snare and fly away, and so in vain the net is spread in their sight. This explanation is in agreement with Ovid's statement, "Quae nimis apparent retia vitat avis." The moral motive put before youth in this case is the aggravation of his guilt if he listens to the enticements of sinners.

The expression in this second hemistich does not mean that the rapacious take the life of their comrades who possess the gain, as Rabbi Salomon; nor as the Vulgate, "the ways of the avaricious man take away the lives of those who possess them." For the phrase, "taketh away the life," as importing a violent taking away, cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-33.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">Second admonitory discourse. Address of Wisdom personified, exhibing the folly of those who wilfully reject, and the security of those who hearken to, her counsels.</span> The sacred writer, in this section, as also in ch. 8, uses the rhetorical figure of prosopopceia, or impersonation. Wisdom is represented as speaking and as addressing the simple, scorners, and fools. The address itself is one of the noblest specimens of sacred eloquence, expressing in rapid succession the strongest phases of feeling - pathetic solicitude with abundant promise, indignant scorn at the rejection of her appeal, the judicial severity of offended majesty upon offenders, and lastly the judicial complacency which delights in mercy towards the obedient. The imagery in part is taken from the forces of nature in their irresistible and overwhelming violence and destructive potency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom crieth without.</span> <span class="accented">Wisdom</span>. The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">khochmoth</span>) here used to designate Wisdom seems to be an abstract derivation from the ordinary <span class="accented">khochmah.</span> The form is peculiar to the Proverbs and Psalms, in the former occurring four times (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>), and in the latter twice only (viz. <a href="../../par/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>). As in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> and Proverbs 24:7, it is a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> of the feminine gender, a variety of the <span class="accented">pluralis extensivus</span>, as Bottcher prefers to denominate it. The feminine form may he determined by the general law which associates purity and serenity with womanhood (Plumptre). The idea of plurality, however, is not that of extension, but of comprehension, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not so much all kinds of wisdom which is presented to us, as all the varieties under which wisdom <span class="accented">par excellence</span> may be regarded and is comprehended. The plural form of the word denotes the highest character or excellence in which wisdom can be conceived; or, as the marginal reading expresses it, wisdoms, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> excellent wisdom. Other instances of the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> are met with in Holy Writ, <span class="accented">e.g. Elohim</span>, God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "God of Gods," either from the polytheistic view, or from the monotheistic view as expressive of God's might in manifestation, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <span class="accented">k'doshim</span>, "the Holy (God)," <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>; <span class="accented">adonim</span>, for <span class="accented">adon</span> "lord" (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 108. 2 <span class="accented">b</span>). In the conception of Wisdom here presented to us in the text we have the germ of an idea which, on the principles of expansion, developed subsequently in the consciousness of the Christian Church into a definite identification of Wisdom with the Second Person of the blessed Trinity. There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, where Christ speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "the Wisdom of God," that shall send prophets and apostles into the world, and thereby identifies himself with Wisdom (cf. this with vers. 20, 21; ch. 7.). Again, a striking similarity is observable between the teaching of Divine Wisdom and that of the Incarnate Word, as much in their promises as in their threats and warnings. But it is difficult to determine with accuracy to what extent the Messianic import of the personification was present to the <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of the sacred writers, and whether Wisdom as here presented to us is simply a poetic and abstract personification or a distinct by-postatizing of the Word. Dorner ('Pers. of Christ,' Introd., p. 16), with reference to ch. 8:22, etc., says that though Wisdom is introduced speaking as a personality distinct from God, still the passage does not lead clearly to an hypostatizing of the Khochmah. Dollinger ('Heidenthum und Judenthum,' bk. 10. pt. 3. sec. 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc.) maintains that Wisdom is "the personified idea of the mind of God in creation," rather than the presence of "a distinct hypostasis." Lucke (see references in Liddon, 'Bampton Lects.') holds that in Proverbs Wisdom is merely a personification It is clear that whatever is predicated  of Wisdom in ch. 8. must be also predicated of her in the passage before us, in reference either to the hypostatic or opposite view. On the other hand, a large number of expositors, dating from the earliest periods of the Christian Church down to the present time, see in Wisdom a distinct hypostasis, or person - the Lord Jesus Christ. A fuller investigation of this subject will be seen in our remarks on ch. 8. For the present we observe that Wisdom is essentially Divine. Her authority, her utterances, whether of promise, threat, scorn, or vengeance, are the authority, the utterances, of God. <span class="accented">Crieth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">crieth loudly</span>, or <span class="accented">aloud.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">ranan</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) is "to vibrate the voice," and conveys the idea of the clear loud ringing tones with which proclamations were made; cf. the Vulgate <span class="accented">praedicare</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">clamitate</span>, "to cry with a loud voice." Fleischer remarks that the Arabic <span class="accented">rannan</span>, which is allied to the Hebrew verb, is used of a speaker who has a clear piercing voice. In such a way does Wisdom cry without when making her address. She elevates her voice that all may hear. The verb in the original is <span class="accented">tazonnah</span>, the feminine singular of <span class="accented">ranan</span>, and predicate to "Wisdom," according to the rule that verbs in the singular are construed with plural nouns having a singular signification, especially the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 146. 2). <span class="accented">Without.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">bakhuts</span>) is here used adverbially, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>, and signifies "in the open places," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> abroad, without, as opposed to the space within the walls. The writer here begins his enumeration of the five places wherein Wisdom preaches, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> without, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the streets, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in chief places of concourse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in the opening of the gates, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> in the city, all of which are public, and thus indicate the publicity of her announcements (with those comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">She uttereth her voice;</span> or, <span class="accented">causeth her voice to be beard</span>; represented in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">dat vocem suam.</span> and in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (equivalent to "she observes free-spokenness"). The instrumentality which Wisdom uses in her public preaching are the prophets and teachers (Ecclus. 24:33; Zockler, Vatablus, Mercerus). <span class="cmt_word">In the streets;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the wide spares</span>; the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), being, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, "wide spaces," and corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the LXX.; <span class="accented">plateae</span>, Vulgate.

The Syriac reading, in <span class="accented">compitis</span>, gives a different sense, as <span class="accented">compitum</span>, equivalent to "crossroads."

In place of the expression, "in the openings of the gates," the LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "And at the gates of the mighty she sits" - an interpolation which only partially represents the sense of the original, and which is adopted in the Arabic.

The Vulgate combines the separate clauses of the original in one - in <span class="accented">foribus portarum urbis</span>, "in the entrances and openings of the gates of the city." <span class="cmt_word">In the city</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">bair</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the city itself (so Aben Ezra, ap. Gejerus), as opposed to the entrance by  the gates, and so used antithetically (as Umbreit, Bertheau, Hitzig). The publicity of the teaching of Wisdom, observable in the places she selects for that purpose, also marked the public ministry of our Lord and his disciples, and finds an illustration in his command, "What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> give it all the publicity possible. The spirit of Wisdom, like that of Christianity, is aggressive (see Wardlaw, 'Lectures on <a href="../../par/proverbs/4.htm">Proverbs 4</a>,' vol. 1. pp. 40, 41). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a></div><div class="verse">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?</span> etc. From this verse to the end of the chapter the sacred writer puts before us the words of Wisdom herself. The discourse begins in the same way as in <a href="../../par/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a> (Zockler), and the classification of the persons addressed - the simple, the scorners, and the sinners - closely resembles that of <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. In the order there is a progression from the least to the most culpable. <span class="accented">The simple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">p'thayim</span>)<span class="accented">, as</span> in ver. 4, those who are indifferent through thoughtlessness and inconsiderateness, and are thereby open to evil. <span class="cmt_word">The scorners</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">letsim</span>); or, <span class="accented">mockers</span>, the same as the (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">latson</span>) "scornful men" of <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-8.htm">Proverbs 29:8</a>, derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">luts</span>), "to deride, mock," probably by imitating the voice in derision. The mockers are those who hold all things in derision, both human and Divine, who contemn God's admonitions, and treat with ridicule both threatenings and promises alike. <span class="cmt_word">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ch'silim</span>), a different word from the <span class="accented">evilim</span> of ver. 7, but signifying much the same, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the obdurate, the hardened, <span class="accented">stolidi</span>, those who walk after the sight of their eyes and the imagination of their hearts - a class not ignorant of knowledge, but hating it because of the restraint it puts them under. The word occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>, in the sense of the incorrigible; in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3, 4</a> as a term of the greatest contempt. The <span class="accented">enallage</span>, or interchange of tenses in the original - the verbs "love" and "hate" being future, and "delight" being perfect - is not reproducible in English. The perfect is used interchangeably with the future where the action or state is represented as first coming to pass or in progress, and, as Zockler remarks, may be inchoative, and so be rendered "become fond of," instead of "be fond of." But it appears to represent not so much a state or action first coming to pass as in progress (see Geseuius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 126, 3). Bottcher (&sect; 948, 2) translates it by <span class="accented">concupiverint, i.e.</span> "How long shall ye have delighted in scorning?" The futures express "love" and "hate" as habitual sentiments (Delitzsch). It is to be noted that the language of Wisdom, in vers. 22 and 23, is expressive of the most tender and earnest solicitude.

The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> conveys the argumentative conviction which will be present in the reproof.

The outflow of the Spirit of Wisdom will be like the abundant and continuous gushing forth of water from the spring or fountain. The verb unites in it the figures of abundant fulness and refreshing invigoration (Umbreit, Elster); comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-171.htm">Psalm 119:171</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>. We have here striking anticipation of the prophecy of Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). The Spirit is that of Wisdom "and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and godly strength, the Spirit of knowledge and true godliness" (see Confirmation Office). The explanation of Beda, that it signifies her anger, is clearly inadmissible. <span class="cmt_word">I will make known my words unto you;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the LXX., "I will teach you my word" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>), or as the Vulgate "show" (<span class="accented">ostendam</span>), "expound, or make clear." <span class="accented">My words</span> (<span class="accented">d'vari</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> precepts, or doctrine, or secrets. An intimate relation subsists between the "Spirit" of Wisdom and her "words," with which it is parallel. The former is the illuminating, invigorating principle which infuses life and power into the "words" of Wisdom, which she has already given, and which are already in our possession. Wisdom stands in the same relation to her words as the Divine Logos does to his utterances, into which he infuses himself. "It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>.

The terrific nature of the punishment of the wicked is marked by a succession of terms all of terrible import - calamity, fear, desolation, destruction, distress, and anguish (vers. 26, 27). When these come upon them, then Wisdom will laugh and have them in derision. The verbs "laugh" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">sakhak</span>) and "mock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>) are the same as in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where they are rendered "to mock" and "have in derision." <span class="cmt_word">When your fear cometh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has actually arrived. <span class="accented">Fear</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">pakhad</span>); here used metonymically for that which causes the fear or terror (<span class="accented">id, quod timebatis</span>, Vulgate).

The declaration is the embodiment of the laughter and scorn of ver. 26. The three verbs, "they shall call," "they shall seek," "they shall find," occur in uncommon and emphatic forms in the original. They are some out of the few instances where the future terminations are inserted fully before the pronominal suffix. <span class="cmt_word">I will not answer</span>. The distress and anguish consequent upon their calamity and fear lead them to pray, but there will be no answer nor heed given to their cry. They are not heard, because they do not cry rightly nor in the time of grace (Lapide). See the striking parallel to the tenor of this passage in <a href="../../par/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24-28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall seek me early;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> diligently. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakhar</span>) is the denominative from the substantive <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakar</span>), "the dawn, morning," and signifies to go out and seek something in the obscurity of the morning twilight (Delitzsch, Zockler), and hence indicates diligence and earnestness in the search. Gesenius gives the same derivation, but connects it with the dawn in the sense of the light breaking forth, and thus, as it were, seeking (see also Proverbs 2:27; 7:15; 8:17; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>).

They recapitulate the charges already made against the sinners in vers. 22 and 25, and now set them forth as the ground or reason why Wisdom, on her part, turns a deaf ear to their entreatries. Wisdom will disregard the n because they have previously disregatded her. The connection is denoted in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, for the Hebrew <span class="accented">takbath ki</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">because</span>," and in the Authorized Version by the punctuation. <span class="cmt_word">Did not choose the fear of the Lord.</span> The verb "to choose" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">bakhar</span>) combines in itself the meanings of <span class="accented">eligere</span> and <span class="accented">diligere</span> (Fleischer), and therefore signifies here not only choice of, but also the fuller sense of love for, the fear of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">They despised</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rejected the reproof with scorn or derision, sneered or turned up their noses at it (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.), disparaged it (<span class="accented">detrahere</span>, Vulgate), or, more strongly, as Gejerus says, execrated it.

This sentiment of retributive punishment also found expression in Terence, "Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est edendum" ('Phorm.,' 2. 1. 4). When we are punished, the blameworthiness lies not with God, but with us sinners (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be filled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, or <span class="accented">surfeited</span>; <span class="accented">saturabuntur</span> (Vulgate). The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">shava</span>) means not only "to fill," but "to be satiated or cloyed" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-16.htm">Proverbs 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>). Michaelis remarks on this word, "Ad nauseam implebuntur et comedent, ita ut consiliorum suorum vehementer tandem, sed nimis sero, ipsos poeniteat" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores in Prov.'), "They shall be filled and eat <span class="accented">ad nauseam</span>, so that at length, but too late, they shall vehemently repent them of their own counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Counsels</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">moetsoth</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ungodly counsels, or evil devices.

Abea Ezra understands it to signify "ease," as in the marginal reading; but there seems no warrant for taking the word in that sense. The LXX. renders the passage quite differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "For because they wronged the young, they shall be slain;" so also the Arabic. The turning away is from the warnings and invitations of Wisdom, and implies <span class="accented">rebelliousness</span> against God. <span class="cmt_word">The prosperity</span>. The word in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shal'vah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> here used in a bad sense, and means "carelessness, indolence," that carnal security which is induced by prosperity and worldly success, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>, "I spoke to thee in thy prosperity (security), but thou saidst, I will not hear" (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, where it is translated "idleness." So Dathe translates, "Incuria ignavorum eos perdit." The Chaldee Paraphrase and Syriac Versions read "error." It occurs in a good sense as "tranquillity," "security," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>. The derivation of the word is  from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shalah</span>). "to be tranquil, to be safe, secure." Marines remarks that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity, because we endure adversity, we are corrupted by prosperity, and prosperity or ease makes fools mad. The false security of the prosperous is illustrated by our Lord in his parable of the rich fool (<a href="../../par/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>). The LXX. differs again from the Hebrew in the second clause of this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carefully considered judgment of God concerning them shall destroy them.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a></div><div class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearkeneth unto me.</span> Wisdom, in closing her address, draws a beautiful picture of the real security and peace of the righteous, as contrasted with the false security of the wicked. As on the one side rejection of her counsels, her warnings, and invitations, carries with it punishment and irretrievable ruin; so, on the other, the hearkening to her words, and loving obedience, are rewarded by her with the choicest blessings. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell safely</span>; that is, with confidence, without danger (<span class="accented">absque terrore</span>, Vulgate). The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">shachan betakh</span>)<span class="accented">, is</span> used in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12-18</a> of the safety with which the covenant people should dwell in the land that God had given them; but it is capable of a further extension of meaning beyond mere temporal security, viz. to the spiritual peace of the righteous. The psalmist also employs it to describe the confidence with which he awaits the resurrection, when he says, "My flesh also shall rest in hope [or, 'dwell confidently']" (<a href="../../par/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>). So here Wisdom promises that he who hearkens to her shall dwell calmly and undisturbed amidst the distractions of the world. The promise agrees with the description of Wisdom elsewhere that "her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." <span class="cmt_word">And shall be quiet;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">shaanan</span>, perfect pilel). Wisdom regards her assurance as already accomplished, and hence the perfect in the original is used for the future. The hearers and doers of her will shall live in tranquillity; nay, they are already doing so. It is a thing not only in prospect, but in possession. <span class="cmt_word">From fear of evil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either without any fear of evil, fear being removed (<span class="accented">timore sublato</span>, Vulgate), or, as the Authorized Version expresses it, connecting the phrase more intimately with the verb - "quiet from fear of evil." It is not only evil, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">raah</span>), in its substantial form, as calamity, they are to be free from, but even the fear of it.

But <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">choreph</span>) denotes the time of gathering - the autumn; so we would translate, "At the time of harvest the sluggard ploughs not" - just when the ground is most easily and profitably worked. "The weakness of the coulter and other parts of the plough requires that advantage be taken, in all but the most friable soils, of the softening of the surface by the winter or spring rains; so that the peasant, if industrious, has to plough in the winter, though sluggards still shrink from its cold, and have to beg in the harvest" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:491). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mendicabit ergo aestate, et non dabitur illi.</span> But this does not accurately represent the meaning of the clause. If ever the prosperous are disposed to relieve the needy, it would be at the time when they have safely garnered their produce; an appeal to their charity at such a moment would not be made in vain. Rather the sentence signifies that the lazy man, having neglected to have his land ploughed at the proper time, "when he asks (for his fruits) at harvest time, there is nothing." He puts off tilling his fields day after day, or never looks to see if his labourers do their duty, and so his land is not cultivated, and he has no crop to reap when autumn comes. "By the street of By-and-by one arrives at the house of Never" (Spanish proverb). Taking a different interpretation of the word <span class="accented">choreph</span>, the LXX. renders, "Being reproached, the sluggard is not ashamed, no more than he who borrows corn in harvest."

So Ewald and others, Hitzig and Kamphausen translate, "Many a man one names his dear friend;" Delitzsch and Nowack prefer, "Most men meet a man who is gracious to them;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is common enough to meet a man who seems benevolent and well disposed. Vulgate, "Many men are called merciful;" Septuagint, "Man is a great thing, and a merciful man is a precious thing." The renderings of most modern commentators imply the statement that love and mercy are common enough, at least in outward expression. The Authorized Version pronounces that men are ready enough to parade and boast of their liberality, like the hypocrites who were said proverbially to sound a trumpet when they performed their almsdeeds (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>). Commenting on the Greek rendering of the clause given above, St. Chrysostom observes, "This is the true character of man to be merciful; yea, rather the character of God to show mercy... Those who answer not to this description, though they partake of mind, and are never so capable of knowledge, the Scripture refuses to acknowledge them as men, but calls them dogs, and horses, and serpents, and foxes, and wolves, and if there be any animals more contemptible" ('Hom. 4 in Phil.' and 'Hom. 13 in 1 Tim.,' Oxford transl.). The contrast between show, or promise, and performance is developed in the second clause. <span class="cmt_word">But a faithful man who can find?</span> The faithfulness intended is fidelity to promises, the practical execution of the vaunted benevolence; this is rare indeed, so that a psalmist could cry, "I said in my haste, All men are liars" (<a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). Lesetre refers to Massillon's sermon, 'Sur la Gloire Humaine,' where we read (the preacher, of course, rests on the Latin Version), "Ces hommes vertueux dont le monde se fait tant d'honneur, n'ont au fond souvent pour eux que l'erreur publique. Amis fideles, je le veux; mais c'est le gout, la vanite ou Pin teret, qui les lie; et dans leur amis, ils n'amient qu' eux-memes En un mot, dit l'Ecriture, on les appelle misericordieux, ils ont toutes les vertus pour le public; mais n'etant pas fideles a Dieu, ils n'en ont pas une seule pour eux-memes."

So the Septuagint and Vulgate. The man of pure life, who religiously performs his duty towards God and man, shall bring a blessing on his children who follow his good example, both during his life and after his death. The temporal promise is seen in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, etc. Some see here an instance of utilitarianism; but it cannot be supposed that the writer inculcates virtue for the sake of the worldly advantages connected with it; rather he speaks from experience, and from a faithful dependence on Providence, of the happy results of a holy life.

Nothing unrighteous can abide in his presence (comp. ver. 26; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10</a>, etc.). See here an adumbration of the characteristic of the Messiah, the great King whose "eyes behold, whose eyelids try, the children of men" (<a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>): who is "of purer eyes than to behold evil" (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>); who "with righteousness shall judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).

This is expressed in <a href="../../par/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one." At the dedication of the temple, Solomon enunciates this fact of man's corruption, "There is no man that sinneth not" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a>). The prophet testifies, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is desperately sick: who can know it?" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). And St. John warns, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). The heart is cleansed by self-examination and repentance; but it is so easy to deceive one's self in this matter, sins may lurk undetected, motives may be overlooked, so that no one can rightly be self-righteous, or conceited, or proud of his spiritual state. The "my sin" at the end of the clause is rather possible than actual sin; and the  expression means that no one can pride himself on being secure from yielding to temptation, however clean for a time his conscience may be. The verse, therefore, offers a stern corrective of two grievous spiritual errors - presumption and apathy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-10.htm">Proverbs 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures, both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Divers weights,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">divers measures;</span> literally, <span class="accented">stone and stone, ephah and ephah.</span> The stones were used for weighing: dishonest traders kept them of different weights, and also measures of different capacities, substituting one for the other in order to defraud unwary customers. The Septuagint makes this plain by rendering, "A weight great and small, and measures double" (see on Proverbs 11:1 and Proverbs 16:11; and comp. ver. 23). The ephah was a dry measure, being one-tenth of the homer, and occupying the same position in solids as the bath did in liquids. It equalled about three pecks of our measure. <span class="cmt_word">Both of them are alike abomination to the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>, etc.); Septuagint, "Are impure before the Lord, even both of them, and he who doeth them." Pseudo-Bernard ('De Pass. Dom.,' 17.), applying the passage mystically, teaches that a man may be said to keep a double measure, who, being conscious of his own evil character, endeavours to appear righteous to others; who, as he puts it, "Suo judicio terrae proximus est, et aliis cupit elevatus videri." Others, connecting this verse in thought with the preceding, see in it a warning against judging a neighbour by a standard which we do not apply to ourselves. The Septuagint Version arranges the matter from ver. 10 onwards differently from the Hebrew, omitting vers. 14-19, and placing vers. 10-13 after ver. 22. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <i>be</i> pure, and whether <i>it be</i> right.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even a child is known</span> (<span class="accented">maketh himself known</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by his doings</span>. (For "even" (<span class="accented">gam</span>), see on Proverbs 17:26.) A child is open, simple, and straightforward in his actions; he has not the reserves and concealments which men practise, so you see by his conduct what his real character and disposition are. Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in the sense of "play," "games;" but it seems never to have this meaning, and there is no need to change the usual signification. The habits of a life are learned in early age. The boy is father of the man. Delitzsch quotes the German proverbs, "What means to become a hook bends itself early," and "What means to become a thorn sharpens itself early;" and the Aramaean, "That which will become a gourd shows itself in the bud:" <span class="cmt_word">Whether his work be pure</span> ("clean," as ver. 9 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and whether it be right.</span> His conduct will show thus much, end will help one to prognosticate the future. Septuagint (according to the Vatican), "In his pursuits (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) a young man will be fettered in company with a holy man, and his way will be straight," which seems to mean that a good man will restrain the reckless doings of a giddy youth, and will lead him into better courses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</span> This apothegm, which seems to be nothing but a trite truism, brings to notice many important consequences. First, there is the result noted in <a href="../../par/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?" Hence we learn the sleepless providence of God. So 'Pirke Aboth,' "Know that which is above thee, an eye that seeth all, an ear that heareth all." We learn also that all things are directed and overruled by God (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>). Then there is the thought that these powers of ours, being the gift of God, should be used piously and in God's service. "Mine ears hast thou opened...  Lo, I come...  I delight to do thy will, O my God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.). The eye should be blind, the ear deaf, to all that might defile or excite to evil (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). But it is the Lord alone that enables the spiritual organs to receive the wondrous things of God's Law; they must be educated by grace to enable them to perform their proper functions. "God hath given us eyes," says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 22 in 1 Corinthians'), "not that we may look wantonly, but that, admiring his handiwork, we may worship the Creator. And that this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an immeasurable distances, but a woman's beauty one cannot discern so far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly given? Again, he made the ear, that we should entertain not blasphemous words, but saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives anything dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also. And if we hear anything cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if anything decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice." "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Septuagint, "The ear heareth and the eye sooth, and both are the works of the Lord."

But the Khetib has, "for strangers," which seems to be the original reading; and the first words ought to be translated, "hold him in pledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seize his person for the sake of the strangers for whom he has stood security, so as not to suffer loss from them. The Law endeavoured to secure lending to needy brethren without interest (see <a href="../../par/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8, 13</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 22:12): but it allowed the creditor to secure himself by taking pledges of his debtor, while it regulated this system so as to obviate most of its severity and oppressiveness (see the restrictions in <a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6, 12</a>, etc.). "Where the debtor possessed nothing which he could pledge, he gave the personal security of a friend. This was a very formal proceeding. The surety gave his hand both to the debtor and to the creditor before an assembly legally convened, he deposited a pledge, and, in accordance with this twofold promise, was regarded by the creditor in just the same light as the debtor himself, and treated accordingly. If the debtor, or in his place the surety, was unable to pay the debt when it fell due, he was entirely at the mercy of the creditor. The authorities troubled themselves but little about these relations, and the law, so far as it is preserved to us, gave no directions in the matter. We see, however, from many allusions and narratives, what harsh forms these relations actually took, especially in later times, when the ancient national brotherly love which the Law presupposed was more and more dying out. The creditor could not only forcibly appropriate all the movable, but also the fixed property, including the hereditary estate (this at least till its redemption in the year of jubilee), nay, he could even (if he could find nothing else of value) carry off as a prisoner the body of his debtor, or of his wife and child, to employ them in his service, though this could only he done for a definite period" (Ewald, 'Antiquities,' p. 184, etc., transl.).

The legal penalty may be seen (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>); but this was probably seldom or never carried into execution (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His lamp shall be put out in obscure</span> (<span class="accented">the blackest</span>) <span class="cmt_word">darkness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>).

"Lamp" is a metaphor applied to the bodily and the spiritual life, to happiness and prosperity, to a man's fame and reputation, to a man's posterity; and all these senses may be involved in the denunciation of the disobedient and stubborn child. He shall suffer in body and soul, in character, in fortune, in his children. His fate is the exact counterpart of the blessing promised in the Law. Septuagint, "The lamp of him that revileth father and mother shall be extinguished, and the pupils of his eyes shall behold darkness."

The maxim, taken in connection with the preceding verse, may apply to a bad son who thinks his parents live too long, and by violence robs them of their possessions; or to one who, like the prodigal in the parable, demands prematurely his portion of the paternal goods. But it may also be taken generally as denouncing the fate of those who make haste to be rich, being unscrupulous as to the means by which they gain wealth (see on Proverbs 23:11; 28:20, 22).

The <span class="accented">jus talonis</span> is the natural feeling of man, to do to others as they have done unto you, to requite evil with evil. But the moralist teaches a better lesson, urging men not to study revenge, and approaching nearer to Christ's injunction, which gives the law of charity, "Whatsoever <span class="accented">ye would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>). The Christian rule is expounded fully by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14, 17</a>, etc). It was not unknown to the Jews; for we read in Tobit 4:15, "Do that to no man which thou hatest;" and Hillel enjoins, "Do not thou that to thy neighbour which thou hatest when it is done to thee." Even the heathens had excogitated this great principle. There is a saying of Aristotle, preserved by Diogenes Laertius, "Act towards your friends as you would wish them to act towards you." The Chinese have a proverb, "Water does not remain on the mountain, or vengeance in a great mind." <span class="cmt_word">Wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.</span> The pious writer urges the injured person to commit his cause to the Lord, not in the hope of seeing vengeance taken on his enemy, but in the certainty that God will help him to bear the wrong and deliver him in his own good time and way. The Christian takes St. Peter's view, "Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-13.htm">1 Peter 3:13</a>), knowing that "all things work together for good to them that love God" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; comp. Ecclus. 2:2, 6). Septuagint, "Say not, I will avenge myself on my enemy, but wait on the Lord, that (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) he may help thee." The last clause may be grammatically rendered thus, but it is more in accordance with the spirit st' the proverb, as Delitzsch observes, to regard it as a promise. Vulgate, <span class="accented">et liberabit te.</span>

The proverb says that the steps of a great and powerful man depend, as their final cause, upon the Lord; he conditions and controls results. Man has free will, and is responsible for his actions, but God foreknows them, and holds the thread that connects them together; he gives preventing grace; he gives efficient grace: and man blindly works out the designs of Omnipotence according as he obeys or resists. A similar maxim is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, "A man's goings are established of the Lord," but the meaning there is that it is God's aid which enables a man to do certain actions. Here we have very much the same intimation that is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> and Proverbs 19:21; and see note on Proverbs 16:9. Hence arises the old prayer used formerly at prime, and inserted now (with some omissions) at the end of the Anglican Communion Service: "O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, our thoughts, words, and actions, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection we may be preserved both here and forever." If man cannot see all sides, as God does, cannot comprehend the beginning, middle, and end in one view, how then can a man (a weak mortal) understand his own ways. How can he find out of himself whither he should go, or what will be the issue of his doings (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>)? St. Gregory, "It is well said by Solomon [<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>], 'There are righteous and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God; and yet no man knoweth whether he is deserving of love or of hatred; but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come.' Hence it is said again by the same Solomon, 'What man will be able to understand his own way?' And any one doing good or evil is doubtless known by the testimony of his own conscience. But it is said that their own way is not known to men, for this reason, because, even if a man understands that he is acting rightly, yet he knows not, under the strict inquiry, whither he is going" ('Moral.,' 29:34).

The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ruina est homini devorare sanctos</span>, which is explained to mean that it is destruction for a man to persecute the saints of God. But the word <span class="accented">devorare</span> is not certain, as the manuscripts vary between this and four other readings, viz. <span class="accented">devotares, denotare, devovere</span>, and <span class="accented">devocare.</span> The Authorized Version signifies that it is a sin to take for one's own consumption things dedicated to God, as firstfruits, the priests' portions, etc.: or a man's snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his covetousness (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), leads him to commit sacrilege.

The clause will then run, "It is a snare to a man rashly to cry, Holiness!" equivalent to "It is holy!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to use the formula for consecrating something to holy purposes. Septuagint, "It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate something of his own" (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And after vows to make inquiry;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after he has made his vow, to begin to consider whether he can fulfil it or not.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a></div><div class="verse">A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise king scattereth the wicked</span> (ver. 8). The verb is <span class="accented">zarah</span>, which means "to winnow, or sift." The king separates the wicked and the good, as the winnowing fan or shovel divides the chaff from the wheat. The same metaphor is used of Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>). Septuagint, "A winnower (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) of the ungodly is a wise king." <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth the wheel over them.</span> The threshing wheel is meant (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). This was a wooden frame with three or four rollers under it armed with iron teeth. It was drawn by two oxen, and, aided by the weight of the driver, who had his seat upon it, it crushed out the grain, and cut up the straw into fodder. Another machine much used in Palestine was made of two thick planks fastened together side by side, and having sharp stones fixed in rows on the lower surface. It is not implied that the king employed the corn drag as an instrument of punishment, which was sometimes so used in war, as possibly may be inferred from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>; and <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. The idea of threshing is carried on, and the notion is rather of separation than of punishment, though the latter is not wholly excluded. The wise ruler will not only distinguish between the godless and the good, but will show his discrimination by visiting the evil with condign puuishment. Septuagint, "He will bring the wheel upon them;" the Vulgate has curiously, <span class="accented">Incurvat super eos fornicem</span>, "He bends an arch over them," which Latin commentators explain as a triumphal arch, meaning that the king conquers and subdues the wicked, and celebrates his victory over them. A patent anachronism which needs no comment!

We may consider it as equivalent to what we Christians call conscience, with its twofold character of receiving light and illumination from God, and sitting as judge and arbiter of actions. It is named "the Lord's lamp," because this moral sense is a direct gift of God, and enables a man to see his real condition. Our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-23.htm">Matthew 6:23</a>) speaks of the light that is in man, and gives a solemn warning against the danger of letting it be darkened by neglect and sin; and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>) argues, "Who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man, which is in him?" As Elihu says (<a href="../../par/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>), "There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding." And Aristotle speaks of practical wisdom (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) combined with virtue as "the eye of the soul (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Searching all the inward parts of the belly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the very depths of the soul, probing thoughts, desires, affections, will, and approving or reproving, according as they are in conformity with or opposition to God's Law. We must remember that Eastern houses, before the introduction of glass, had very scanty openings to admit light, and lamps were necessary if for any purpose the interior had to be thoroughly illuminated. Hence the metaphor used above would strike an Oriental more forcibly than it strikes us. Septuagint, "The breath (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span>, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>) of man is a light of the Lord, who searches the chambers of the belly." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 12:64), "We ought to bear in mind that in holy Writ by the title of the 'belly,' or the 'womb,' the mind is used to be understood. For the light of grace, which comes from above, affords a 'breathway' to man unto life, which same light is said to 'search all the inward parts of the belly,' in that it penetrates all the secrets of the heart, that the things which were hidden in the soul touching itself it may bring back before the eyes thereof" (Oxford transl.).

Chaburoth</span> means "stripes," and the proverb says that deep-cutting stripes are the only effectual cure of evil; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> severe punishment is the best healing process in cases of moral delinquency (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>). Painful remedies, incisions, cauteries, amputations, are often necessary in the successful treatment of bodily ailments; spiritual sickness needs sterner, more piercing, remedies. <span class="cmt_word">So do stripes the inward parts of the belly;</span> or better, <span class="accented">and strokes that reach</span>, etc. The stings of conscience, warnings and reproofs which penetrate to the inmost recesses of the heart, chastisement which affects the whole spiritual being. - these are needful to the correction and purification of inveterate evil. Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding thus: as strength gives a glory to young men, and hoar hairs adorn an old man, so wounds and bruises, so to speak, ornament the sinner, mark him out, and at the same time heal and amend him. It may also be connected with ver. 27. If a man will not use the lamp which God has given him for illumination and correction, he must expect severe chastisement and sternest discipline. Septuagint, "Bruises (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) and contusions befall bad men, and plagues that reach to the chambers of the belly." St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 23:40, "By the blueness of a wound he implies the discipline of blows on the body. But blows in the secret parts of the belly are the wounds of the mind within, which are inflicted by compunction. For as the belly is distended when filled with food, so is the mind puffed up when swollen with wicked thoughts. The blueness, then, of a wound, and blows in the secret parts of the belly, cleanse away evil, because both outward discipline does away with faults, and compunction pierces the distended mind with the punishment of penance. But they differ from each other in this respect, that the wounds of blows give us pain, the sorrows of compunction have good savour. The one afflict and torture, the others restore when they afflict us. Through the one there is sorrow in affliction, through the other there is joy in grief" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/21.htm"><title>Proverbs 21 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/21.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/21.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/21-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/20.htm" title="Proverbs 20">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 21 <a href="../proverbs/22.htm" title="Proverbs 22">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a></div><div class="verse">The king's heart <i>is</i> in the hand of the LORD, <i>as</i> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water.</span> We are to think of the little channels used for irrigation.

"Flower beds and gardens of herbs are always made at a little lower level than the surrounding ground, and are divided into small squares, a slight edging of earth banking the whole round on each side. Water is then let in, and floods the entire surface till the soil is thoroughly saturated; after which the moisture is turned off to another bed, by simply closing the opening in the one under water, by a turn of the bare foot of the gardener, and making another in the same way with the foot, in the next bed, and thus the whole garden is in due course watered ....

But it is best to make the whole verse one idea, as in the Authorized Version. The lifting of the eyes is a term implying pride, as shown in supercilious looks, as if other people were of inferior clay and not worthy of notice. So we have "haughty eyes" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a> (where see note); and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> we read, "There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up." "The enlargement of the heart" is the cause of the proud look, for it signifies the evil affections and concupiscence of the will, wholly filled up with self, and controlling the actions and expression of the body. Septuagint, "A high-minded man (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is stout-hearted in his pride." <span class="cmt_word">And the ploughing of the wicked is sin.</span> The Authorized Version takes the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nir</span>), which means "tillage' (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>), or, as Delitzsch supposes, "land ploughed for the first time" (<span class="accented">novale</span>). The proverb, taken thus, will mean, "high look, proud heart, even all the field which the godless cultivate, all that they do, is sin." "Pride," says the Talmud, "is worse than sin." But another pointing gives a different and very appropriate (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>) meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ner</span>) signifies "a lamp."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue</span> - the acquisition of wealth by fraud and falsehood - <span class="cmt_word">is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death</span>. The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">a fleeting breath, those seeking death.</span> The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, "They that seek them seek death." But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, "of seekers of death." Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, "The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day." Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>. The Talmud enjoins, "Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook." The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), and render thus: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis</span>, "He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;" Septuagint, "pursues vain things unto the snares of death (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). So St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of man is froward and strange;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Perversa via viri, aliens est</span>. Both this and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, translated "and strange" (which seems to mean "alien from what is right"), the <span class="accented">vav</span> is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying "laden with guilt;" so that the clause ought to be rendered, "Crooked is the way of a guilty man" (see note on Proverbs 2:15, where, however, the word is different, though the idea is analogous). An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him. Septuagint, "To the crooked (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) God sendeth crooked ways;" which recalls <a href="../../par/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, "With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward." God allows the wicked to punish themselves by falling into mischief. <span class="cmt_word">As for the pure, his work is right;</span> or, <span class="accented">straight</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>). The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God's law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation. The LXX. refers the clause to God: "for pure and right are his ways." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop.</span> One is to think of the flat roof of an Eastern house, which was used as an apartment for many purposes: <span class="accented">e,g</span>. for sleeping and conference (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</a>), for exercise (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>), for domestic matters (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>), for retirement and prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>). This, though exposed to the inclemency of the weather, would be not an uncomfortable situation during a great part of the year. But the proverb implies a position abnormally inconvenient as an alternative preferable to a residence inside. Hence, perhaps, it is advisable to render, with Delitzsch, "Better to sit on the pinhole of a house roof." Septuagint, "It is better to dwell in a corner of a place open to the sky (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Than with a brawling</span> (<span class="accented">contentious</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>woman in a</span> <span class="cmt_word">wide</span> <span class="cmt_word">house;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a house of society</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a house in common (comp. ver. 19 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-24.htm">Proverbs 25:24</a>). A solitary corner, replete with inconveniences, is to be preferred to house shared with woman, wife or other female relation, of a quarrelsome and vexatious temper. The LXX. puts the matter forcibly, "than in cieled rooms with unrighteousness  and in a common house." So the Latin proverb, "Non quam late, sed quam laete habites, refert." The Scotch have a proverb to the same effect: "A house wi' a reek and a wife wi' a reerd (scold) will sune mak' a man run to the door." "I had rather dwell," says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 25:16), "with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman."

He does not look with pity on friend or neighbour, if they stand in the way of the gratification of his desires; he will sacrifice any one, however closely connected, so that he may work his will. Nothing makes a man more atrociously selfish and hard-hearted than vice (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, and the note there). The LXX. takes the sentence in a passive sense, "The soul of the ungodly shall not be pitied by any one." They who have no pity for others shall meet with no pity themselves; while, on the other hand, the Lord says, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>).

The simple (<span class="accented">parvulus</span>, Vulgate) profit by the punishment of the incorrigibly evil But the wise need not chastisement for their improvement. When the wise is instructed (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>), he (the wise) receiveth knowledge. The wise man uses every opportunity, takes advantage of every circumstance and event, to increase his knowledge and experience. The Vulgate carries on the subject, "And if he (the simple) follow the wise man, he shall attain knowledge." Septuagint, "When the intemperate man is punished, the simple is made cleverer; and a wise man understanding will receive knowledge." "For it often happens," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:38). "that the mind of the weak is the more unsteadied from the hearing of the truth, as it sees the despisers of the truth flourishing; but when just vengeance takes away the unjust, it keeps others away from wickedness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-12.htm">Proverbs 21:12</a></div><div class="verse">The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:</span> <span class="cmt_word">but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.</span> The Authorized Version introduces the words "but God" in order to eke out the sense desired; the Revised Version, for the same reason, has, "how the wicked are overthrown;" and both versions signify that the good man contemplates the fortunes and seeming prosperity of the wicked, and, looking to the end of these men, sees how hollow is their success and what a fatal issue awaits them. The Vulgate refers the passage to the zeal of the righteous for the salvation of sinners - a thought quite foreign to the present subject - thus: <span class="accented">Excogitat justus de domo impii, ut detrahat impios a malo</span>, "The righteous man reflects concerning the house of the wicked how he may deliver them from <span class="accented">evil."</span> The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">A righteous one looketh on the house of the wicked</span>: <span class="accented">he precipitates the wicked to destruction.</span> There is no change of subject in the two clauses, and "a righteous One" (<span class="accented">tsaddik</span>) is God, put indeterminately to excite the greater awe (comp. <a href="../../par/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>). The Lord keeps the sinners under his eye, that he may punish them at the fit moment (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>). The notion of God's moral government of the universe prevails most strongly in every pronouncement of the writer. The LXX. interprets "the house" as heart and conscience, and renders, "A righteous man understands the hearts of the godless, and despises the impious in their wickednesses;" he sees through their outward felicity, knows well its unreality, and despises them for the low aims and pursuits which satisfy them.

It is a joy to the former, "but destruction [or, 'terror'] to them that work iniquity." <span class="accented">Et pavor operantibus iniquitatem</span>, Vulgate. They cannot trust themselves to do rightly without fear; they cannot commit the result to God, as the righteous do; if ever they do act uprightly, it is against their inclination, and such action will, as they fear, bring them to ruin. Septuagint, "It is the joy of the righteous to do judgment; but a holy man is abominable (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) among evil doers."

The denunciation means primarily that the sinner shall soon be with the shades of the dead, shall meet with a speedy death. Wordsworth considers that the writer is saying in bitter irony that the evil man shall rest as a guest at a banquet, shall lie down and be regaled, but it will be in the company of the dead. The contrast seems to lie between the wandering and the rest, and this rest is regarded as penal; so that one must needs see here an intimation of retribution after death; and setup, <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-14.htm">Proverbs 24:14, 20</a>. The Fathers regarded the <span class="accented">Rephaim</span>, "the giants," as the descendants of the rebel angels, in accordance with their interpretation of <a href="../../par/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>.

Some translate the last words, "in abundance," as if the meaning was that the poor endeavours to mitigate the severity of his lot by getting all the pleasure he can from creature comforts however procured.

And the transgressor for the upright. The faithless takes the place of the upright; the stroke passes over the latter, to fall on the former, as in Egypt the destroying angel spared the houses of the Israelites, and poured his wrath on the Egyptians.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a></div><div class="verse">The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination: how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - The first hemistich occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a> (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind!</span> rather, <span class="accented">for evil</span>, equivalent to "in order to atone for wickedness." The sacrifice of the sinner is abominable, as offered formally without repentance and faith; much more abominable, when he brings his offering to win, as it were, God's connivance in the sin which he commits and has no intention of renouncing, - brings it as a kited of bribe and recompense to compensate or his transgression. Such an outrage on God's purity and justice may well be called an abomination. Septuagint, "The sacrifices of the ungodly are abomination unto the Lord, for they. offer them wickedly (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The notion of propitiating the Deity by sharing with him the proceeds of sin is expressed in proverbial language. We have the homely saw, "Steal the goose, and give the giblets in alms;" and the Spaniards say, "Huerto el puerco, y dar los pies por Dios," "Steal the pig, and give away the pettitoes for God's sake" (Kelly). (See Ecclus. 31:18, etc.)

"The man that heareth" is one who is attentive, who listens before he speaks, and reports only what he has heard.

But St. Jerome's rendering has been much used by the Fathers, who have drawn therefrom lessons of obedience. Thus St. Augustine, 'In Psalm.,' 70, "Sola obedientia tenet palmam, sola inobedientia invenit poenam.' St. Gregory, ' Moral,' 35:28, "An obedient man in truth speaketh of victories, because, when we humbly submit ourselves to the voice of another, we overcome ourselves in our heart" (Oxford transl.). See a long dissertation on obedience in the note of Corn. a Lapide on this passage of Proverbs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/21-29.htm">Proverbs 21:29</a></div><div class="verse">A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <i>as for</i> the upright, he directeth his way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wicked man hardeneth his face;</span> is shameless (as <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13</a>), and is insensible to rebuke or any soft feeling.

Hence modern commentators prefer the reading of the Keri, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "he considereth, proveth," his way; he acts only after due thought, giving proper weight to all circumstance. Septuagint, "But the upright man himself understands (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) his ways." The contrast lies in the audacious self-confidence of the unprincipled man, and the calm circumspection and prudence of the saint.

To the earlier Jews, who were unaccustomed to its use, and indeed forbidden to employ it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), the horse and horse-drawn chariots were objects of extreme terror (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>), and though Solomon had largely imported them from Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, etc.), these animals were used exclusively for war, and, at this time, their services were never applied to agricultural purposes.

The great truth here taught may be applied to spiritual matters. The only safety against spiritual enemies is the grace of God; we can cry, with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>), "Thanks be  to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." "By the name 'horse,'" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 31:43), "is understood the preparation of right intention, as it is written, 'The horse is prepared,' etc.; because the mind prepares itself indeed against temptation, but contends not healthfully unless it be assisted from above." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 20"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 22"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm"><title>Proverbs 22 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/22.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/22.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/22-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/21.htm" title="Proverbs 21">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 22 <a href="../proverbs/23.htm" title="Proverbs 23">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a></div><div class="verse">A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches, <i>and</i> loving favour rather than silver and gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches</span>.

Publ. Syr., "Bona opinio hominum tutier pecunia est." The French have a proverb, "Bonne renommee vaut mieux que ceinture doree."

God has ordained that there shall be rich and poor in the world, and that they should meet in the intercourse of life. These social inequalities are ordered for wise purposes; the one helps the other. The labour of the poor makes the wealth of the rich; the wealth of the rich enables him to employ and aid the poor. Their common humanity, their fatherhood in God, should make them regard one another as brethren, without distinction of rank or position: the rich should not despise the poor (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>), the poor should not envy the rich (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>), but all should live in love and harmony as one great family of God.

St. Jerome has <span class="accented">callidus</span>, and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">arum</span>); but it must be taken in a good sense, as cautions, farseeing, prudent (see note on Proverbs 1:4) Such a man looks around, takes warning from little circumstances which might escape the observation of careless persons, and provides for his safety in good time. Thus the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem, believing Christ's warnings, retired to Pella, and wine saved. A Spanish proverb runs, "That which the fool does in the end, the wise man does at the beginning." <span class="cmt_word">The simple pass on, and are punished.</span> The subject of the former hemistich is in the singular number, for a really prudent man is a comparatively rare bring; the second clause is plural, teaching us, as Hitzig observes, that many simple ones are found for one prudent. These silly persons, blundering blindly on their way, without circumspection or forethought, meet with immediate punishment, incur dangers, suffer less. A Cornish proverb runs, "He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock." Septuagint, "An intelligent man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) seeing a wicked man punished is himself forcibly instructed; but fools pass by, and are punished" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>).

The word rendered "by" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> <span class="accented">ekeb</span>), "in reward of," is also taken as the subject of the sentence: "The reward of humility ['and,' or, 'which is'] the fear of God, is riches," etc. There is no copulative in the clause, and a similar asyndeton occurs in ver. 5; so there is no reason why we should not regard the clause in this way. Thus Revised Version, Nowack,  and others. But Delitzsch makes the first hemistich a concluded sentence, which the second member carries on thus: "The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord; it [the reward of humility] is at the same time riches," etc. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Finis modestiae timor Domini, divitiae et gloria et vita</span>; Septuagint, "The generation (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f70;</span>) of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and wealth," etc. It is preferable to translate as above, taking the two expressed virtues as appositional, thus: "The reward of humility, the fear of the Lord." Humility brings with it true religion, which is expressed by "the fear of the Lord." The feeling of dependence, the lowly opinion of self, the surrender of the will, the conviction of sin, all effects which are connected with humility, may well be represented by this term, "the fear of God," which, in another aspect, is itself the source of every virtue and every blessing; <span class="cmt_word">it is riches, and honour, and life.</span> These are God's gifts, the guerdon of faithful service (see notes on Proverbs 3:16 and Proverbs 21:21; and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-18.htm">Proverbs 8:18</a>). The Easterns have a pretty maxim, "The bending of the humble is the graceful droop of the branches laden with fruit." And again, "Fruitful trees bend down; the wise stoop; a dry stick and a fool can be broken, not bent" (Lane). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward.</span> The words are in the Hebrew without the conjunction (see note, ver. 4), though the versions generally add it. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">arma et gladiii</span> but the Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. It is a question whether the thorns are what the perverse prepare for others, or what they themselves suffer. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a> the hedge of thorns represented the difficulties in the sluggard's path; but here, viewed in connection with the following hemistich, the thorns and snares refer to the hindrances proceeding from the froward, which injuriously affect others; "thorns" being a figure of the pains and troubles, "snares" of the unexpected dangers and impediments which evil men cause as they go on their crooked way. The word for "thorns" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>. The plant is supposed to be the <span class="accented">Rhamnus paliurus</span>, but it has not been accurately identified. <span class="cmt_word">He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Train up a child in the way he should go.</span> The verb translated "train" (<span class="accented">chanak</span>) means, first, "to put something into the mouth," "to give to be tasted," as nurses give to infants food which they have masticated in order to prepare it for their nurslings; thence it comes to signify "to give elementary instruction," "to imbue," "to train." The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">Initiate a child in accordance with his way.</span> The Authorized Version, with which Ewald agrees, takes the maxim to mean that the child should be trained from the first in the right path - the path of obedience and religion. This is a very true and valuable rule, but it is not what the author intends. "His way" must mean one of two things - either his future calling and station, or his character and natural inclination and capacity. Delitzsch and Plumptre take the latter interpretation; Nowack and Bertheau the former, on the ground that <span class="accented">derek</span> is not used in the other sense suggested. But, as far as use is concerned, both explanations stand on much the same ground; and it seems more in conformity with the moralist's age and nation to see in the maxim an injunction to consider the child's nature, faculties, and temperament, in the education which is given to him. If, from his early years, a child is thus trained, <span class="cmt_word">when he is old, he will not depart from it.</span> This way, this education in accordance with his idiosyncrasy, will bear fruit all his life long; it will become a second nature, and will never be obliterated. The Vulgate commences the verse with <span class="accented">Proverbium est</span>, taking the first word substantively, as if the author here cited a trite saying; but the rendering is a mistake. There are similar maxims, common at all times and in all countries. Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:272 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est."</span> Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:2, 67 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nunc adbibe puro<br />Pectore verba, puer."</span> For, as he proceeds - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem<br />Testa diu."</span> Thus we have two mediaeval jingles - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Cui puer assuescit, major dimittere nescit."<br />"Quod nova testa capit, inveterata sapit."</span> Then there is the German saw, "Jung gewohnt, alt gethan." "What youth learns, age does not forget," says the Danish proverb. In another and a sad sense the French exclaim, "St jeunesse savait! si vieillesse pouvait!" All the early manuscripts of the Septuagint omit this verse; m some of the later it has been supplied from Theodotion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rich ruleth over the poor.</span> "The rich man (singular) will rule over the poor" (plural); for there are many poor for one rich (see on ver. 3). This is the way  of the world (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-23.htm">Proverbs 18:23</a>). Aben Ezra explains the gnome as showing the advantage of wealth and the inconvenience of poverty; the former bringing power and pre-eminence, the latter trouble and servitude; and hence the moralist implies that every one should strive and labour to obtain a competency, and thus avoid the evils of impecuniosity. The borrower is servant to the lender. (For the relation between borrower and louder, or debtor and creditor, see on Proverbs 20:16; and comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25, 34</a>.) Delitzsch cites the German saying, "Borghart (borrower) is Lehnhart's (leader's) servant." We have the proverb, "He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing." The Septuagint departs from the other versions and our Hebrew text, translating, "The rich will role over the poor, and household servants will lend to their own masters" - a reading on which some of the Fathers have commented. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity;</span> shall gain nothing substantial, shall have nothing to show for his pains. But <span class="accented">aven</span> also means "calamity," "trouble," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>; so the gnome expresses the truth that they who do evil shall meet with punishment in their very sins - the exact contrast to the promise to the righteous (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>). "To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward." Thus we have in <a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>, "They that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same;" and the apostle asserts (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, etc), "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." Eastern proverbs run, "As the sin, so the atonement:" "Those who sow thorns can only reap prickles" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the rod of his anger shall fail.</span> The writer is thinking especially of cruelty and injustice practised on a neighbour, as Delitzsch has pointed out, and he means that the rod which he has raised, the violence intended against the innocent victim, shall vanish away or fall harmlessly. Ewald and others think that the rod is the Divine anger, and translate the verb (<span class="accented">kalah</span>) "is prepared," a sense which here it will not well bear, though the LXX. has lent some countenance to it by rendering, "And shall fully accomplish the plague (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>,? 'punishment') of his deeds." The rendering, "shall fail." "shall be consumed, or annihilated," is confirmed by <a href="../../par/genesis/21-15.htm">Genesis 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, etc. The Septuagint adds a distich here, of which the first member is a variant of ver. 9<span class="accented">a</span>. and the second another rendering of the latter hemistich of the present verse: "A cheerful man and a giver God blesseth (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>): but he shall bring to an end (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) the vanity of his works."

The "good of eye" is the kindly looking, the benevolent man, in contrast to him of the evil eye, the envious, the unfriendly and niggardly man (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>). St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Qui pronus est ad misericordiam.</span> Such a one is blessed by God in this world and the next, in time and in eternity, according to the sentiment of <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. Thus in the temporal sense (Ecclus. 34 (31):23). "Him that is liberal in food lips shall bless, and the testimony of his liberality will be believed." Septuagint, "He that hath pity upon the poor shall himself be continually sustained (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The reason is added, For he giveth of his brans to the poor. The blessing is the consequence of his charity and liberality. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Vulgate and Septuagint add a distich not in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Victoriam et honorem acquiret qui dat munera</span>; <span class="accented">animam autem aufert accipientium</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "Victory and honour he obtaineth who giveth gifts; but he takes away the life of the possessors." The first hemistich appears to be a variant of <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a><span class="accented">b</span>, the second to be derived from <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a><span class="accented">b</span>. The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "Cast out of the company a pestilent fellow" Chase away the scorner (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>), the man who has no respect for things human or Divine, and the disputes and ill feeling which he caused will be ended; for "where no wood is, the fire goeth out" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/26-20.htm">Proverbs 26:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</span> The reproach and ignominy (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">kalon</span>) are those which the presence and words of the scorner bring with them; to have such a one in  the company is a disgrace to all good men. Thus Ishmael and his mother were driven from Abraham's dwelling (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, etc.), and the apostle quotes (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>), "Cast out (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) the bondwoman and her son." Septuagint, "For when he sits in the company he dishonours all." The next verse gives a happy contrast. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-11.htm">Proverbs 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth pureness of heart, <i>for</i> the grace of his lips the king <i>shall be</i> his friend.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth pureness of heart</span>; he who strives to be pure m heart (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), free from guile, lust, cupidity, vice of every kind. The next clause carries on the description of the perfect character, and is best translated. <span class="cmt_word">And hath grace of lips, the king is his friend.</span> He who is not only virtuous and upright, but has the gift of graciousness of speech, winning manner in conversation, such a man wilt attach the king to him by the closest bonds of friendship. We have had something very similar at ch. 16:13. Some of the versions consider that by the king God is meant. Thus the Septuagint, "The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all blameless persons are acceptable with him." The rest of the clause is connected by the LXX. with the following verse, "A king guides his flock (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) with his lips; but the eyes of the Lord," etc.

The expression, "preserve knowledge," is found at Proverbs 5:2 (where see note) in the sense of "keep," "retain," and, taken by itself, it might here signify that the Lord alone possesses knowledge, and alone imparts it to his servants (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>); but as in the following clause a person, the transgressor, is spoken of, it is natural to expect a similar expression in the former. The Revised Version is correct in rendering the abstract "knowledge" by the concrete "him that hath knowledge;" so that the clause says that God watches over and protects the man who knows him and walks in his ways, and uses his means and abilities for the good of others (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-9.htm">Proverbs 11:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he</span> (the Lord) <span class="cmt_word">overthroweth</span> <span class="cmt_word">the words of the transgressor</span>. The transgressor here is the false, treacherous, perfidious man; and the gnome asserts that God frustrates by turning in another direction the outspoken intentions of this man, which he had planned against the righteous (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-12.htm">Proverbs 21:12</a>). Septuagint, "But the eves of the Lord preserve knowledge, but the transgressor despiseth words," <span class="accented">i e.</span> commands, or words of wisdom and warning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-13.htm">Proverbs 22:13</a></div><div class="verse">The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The slothful man saith, There is a lion without</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/26-13.htm">Proverbs 26:13</a>). The absurd nature of the sluggard's excuse is hardly understood by the casual reader. The supposed lion is without, in the open country, and yet he professes to be in danger in the midst of the town. <span class="cmt_word">I shall be slain in the streets.</span> Others consider that the sluggard makes two excuses for his inactivity. If work calls him abroad, he may meet the lion which report says is prowling in the neighbourhood; if he has to go into the streets, he may be attacked and murdered by ruffians for motives of plunder or revenge. "Sluggards are prophets," says the Hebrew proverb. Septuagint, "The sluggard maketh excuses, and saith, A lion is in the ways, there are murderers in the streets." Lions, though now extinct in Palestine, seem to have lingered till the time of the Crusades, and such of them as became man eaters, the old or feeble, were a real danger in the vicinity of villages (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a></div><div class="verse">The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mouth of strange women is a deep pit.</span> The hemistich reappears in a slightly altered form at <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>. (For "strange woman" as equivalent to "a harlot" or "adulteress," see note on Proverbs 2:16.) By her "mouth" is meant her wanton, seductive words, which entice a man to destruction of body and soul. It may be that theology rather than morals is signified here - rather false doctrines than evil practice. In this case the mention of the strange or foreign woman is very appropriate, seeing that perversions of belief and worship were always introduced into Israel from external sources. <span class="cmt_word">He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</span> He who has incurred the width of God by previous unfaithfulness and sin is left to himself to fall a prey to the allurements of the wicked woman (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>). Septuagint, "The mouth of a transgressor (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is a deep ditch; and he that is hated of the Lord shall fall therein." Then are added three lines not in the Hebrew, which, however, seem to be reminiscences of other passages: "There are evil ways before a man, and be loveth not to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn away item a perverse and evil way." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a></div><div class="verse">Foolishness <i>is</i> bound in the heart of a child; <i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child.</span> Foolishness (<span class="accented">ivveleth</span>) here implies the love of mischief, the waywardness and self-will, belonging to children, bound up in their very nature. Septuagint, "Folly is attached (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) to the heart of the young," in which version Cornelius a Lapide sees an allusion to the ornament hung by fond parents round the neck of a child whom they were inclined to spoil rather than to train in self-denying ways. To such a child folly adheres as closely as the <span class="accented">bulla</span> with which he is decorated. But <span class="cmt_word">the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</span> Judicious education overcomes this natural tendency, by punishing it when  exhibited, and imparting wisdom and piety (see on Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 19:18; and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>; Ecclus. 30:1, etc).

The Authorized Version says that he who oppresseth the poor to enrich himself, and he who wastes his means by giving to those who do not need it, will come to poverty. But the antithesis of this distich is thus lost. The Hebrew literally rendered brings out the contrast, <span class="accented">Whosoever oppresseth the poor, it is for his gain</span>; <span class="accented">whosoever giveth to the rich, it is for his loss.</span> Delitzsch explains the sentence thus: "He who enriches himself by extortion from the poor, at any rate gains what he desires; but he who gives to the rich impoverishes himself in vain, has no thanks, reaps only disappointment." One cannot but feel that the maxim thus interpreted is poor and unsatisfactory. The interpretation in the 'Speaker's Commentary' is more plausible: The oppressor of the poor will himself suffer in a similar mode, and will have to surrender his ill-gotten gains to some equally unscrupulous rich man. But the terse antithesis of the original is wholly obscured by this view of the distich. It is far better, with Hitzig, Ewald, and others, to take the gain in the first hemistich as that of the poor man, equivalent to "doth but bring him gain;" though the sentence is not necessarily to be explained as suggesting that the injustice which the poor man suffers at the hand of his wealthy neighbour is a stimulus to him to exert himself in order to better his position, and thus indirectly tends to his enrichment. The maxim is really conceived in the religious style of so many of these apparently worldly pronouncements, and states a truth in the moral government of God intimated elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; and that truth is that the riches extorted from the poor man will in the end redound to his benefit, that by God's providential control the oppression and injustice from which he has suffered shall work to his good. In the second hemistich the loss is that of the rich man. By adding to the wealth of the rich the donor increases his indolence, encourages his luxury, vice, and extravagance, and thus leads to his ruin - "bringeth only to want. Septuagint, "He that calumniates (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) the poor increaseth his own substance, but giveth to the rich at a loss (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>)" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so as to lessen his substance.

All the instruction herein afforded is meant to teach that entire confidence in the Lord which, as soon as his will is known and understood, leads a man to do it at any cost or pains, leaving the result in God's hands. <span class="cmt_word">I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</span> The repetition of the personal pronoun brings home the teaching to the disciple, and shows that it is addressed, not merely to the mass of men, but to each individual among them, who thus becomes responsible for the use which he makes of it (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>). The expression, "this day," further emphasizes the exhortation. The learner is not to remember vaguely that some time or other he received this instruction, but that on this particular  day the warning was given. So in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7, 13</a> we read, "As the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.... Exhort one another daily, so long as it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." Septuagint, "That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known unto thee." Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') quotes Biekell's correction of this verse, "That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, to make known unto thee thy ways;" but the alteration seems arbitrary and unnecessary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a></div><div class="verse">Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge?</span> There is a difficulty about the word tendered "excellent things." The Khetib has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis.</span> Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shalishim</span>), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus we come back to the rendering of the Authorized Version as meet correct and intelligible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a></div><div class="verse">That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth.</span> The object intended is to teach the disciple the fixed rule (<span class="accented">firmitatem</span>, Vulgate) by which truthful words are guided (see <a href="../../par/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>). Septuagint, "I therefore teach thee a true word and knowledge good to learn." <span class="cmt_word">That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee.</span> This implies that the pupil will be enabled to teach others who apply to him for instruction; "will be ready." as St. Peter says, "always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). But the last expression is better translated, "them that send thee;" <span class="accented">illis qui miserunt te</span>, Vulgate (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>); and we must conceive of these as being parents or tutors who send a youth to a school or wise man to be educated. The moralist expresses his desire that the disciple will carry home such wholesome, truthful doctrines as will prove that the pains expended upon him have not been useless. Septuagint, "That thou mayest answer words of truth to those who put questions to thee (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" The Syriac adds, "That I may make known unto thee counsel and wisdom." Bickell's version (quoted by Cheyne) is, "That thou mayest know the rightness of these words, that thou mayest answer in true words to them that ask thee."

And this gives a very appropriate sense. The guest is enjoined to fix his attention, not on the delicate food, but on the host, who is his superior, and able to exalt and to destroy him (compare the cautious maxims in Ecclus. 13:2, 6, 7, 11, etc.).

This is like the warning of Siracides, in the chapter quoted above, where the disciple is admonished not to attend the banquets of rich men, lest he should be tempted to vie with them, and thus ruin himself by attempting to return their civilities in the same lavish manner. The earlier commentators have used the above verses as a lesson concerning the due and reverent partaking of the Holy Communion, thus: "When you approach the table of Christ, consider diligently what is represented by the elements before you, and have discernment and faith, lest you eat and drink unworthily; and after communicating walk warily, mortify all evil desires, live as in the presence of the Lord Jesus, the Giver of the feast."

We have too the Indian saying, "An epicure digs his grave with his teeth," which is true in more senses than one.

In the Authorized Version the word "heart" occurs twice in this verse, but the Hebrew words are different. The first is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "breath," equivalent to "mind;" the second is <span class="accented">leb</span>, "heart." The Vulgate paraphrases the clause, <span class="accented">Quoniam in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris, aestimat quod ignorat</span>, "For like a soothsayer or diviner he conjectures that of which he is ignorant." <span class="cmt_word">Eat and drink, saith he to thee.</span> He professes to make you welcome, and with seeming cordiality invites you to partake of the food upon his table. <span class="cmt_word">But his heart is not with thee.</span> He is not glad to see you enjoy yourself, and his pressing invitation is empty verbiage with no heart in it. The Septuagint, pointing differently, translates, "For as if one should swallow a hair, so he eats and drinks." The Greek translators take the gnome to apply to one who invites an envious man to his table, and finds him eating his food as if it disgusted him. They go on, "Bring him not in to thee, nor eat thy morsel with him; for (ver. 8) he will vomit it up, and outrage thy fair words." In agreement with the gnome above, we find in the Talmud, "My son, eat not the bread of the covetous, nor sit thou at his table. The bread of the covetous is only pain and anguish; the bread of the generous man is a source of health and joy."

But the parallelism with the wine drinker shows plainly that the flesh which they eat is meant, and the idea is that they eat for the gratification of their own appetites, caring nothing for anything else. The combination of glutton and wine bibber was used as a reproach against our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>). The versions of Jerome and the LXX. point to the contributed entertainments, where each guest brought some article to the meal, like our picnics. Thus Vulgate, "Be not among parties of drinkers, nor at the banquets of those who contribute flesh to eat;" Septuagint. "Be not a wine bibber, and strain not after contributed feasts (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and purchases of meats."

Tunc siquidem cor hominum Deo datur, quando omnia cogitatio terminatur in eum, gyrat et circumflectitur super eum, et nihil vult possidere praeter eum. Sicque colligato sibi animo, eum diligit, ut sine ipso amarus sit omnis amor.

A narrow pit is one with a narrow month, from which, if one falls into it, it is difficult to extricate one's self. The verse indicates the seductive nature of the vice of unchastity: how easy it is to be led into it! how difficult to rise from it! Thus St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 11, in 1 Corinthians'), "When by unclean desire the soul is made captive, even as a cloud and mist darken the eyes of the body, so that desire intercepts the foresight of the mind, and suffers no one to see any distance before him, either precipice, or hell, or fear; but thenceforth, having that deceit as a tyrant over him, he comes to be easily vanquished by sin; and there is raised up before his eyes as it were a partition wall, and no windows in it, which suffers not the ray of righteousness to shine in upon the mind, the absurd conceits of lust enclosing it as with a rampart on all sides. And then, and from that time forward, the unchaste woman is everywhere meeting him - before his eyes, before his mind, before his thoughts, in station and presence. And as the blind, although they stand at high noon beneath the very central point of the heaven, receive not the light, their eyes being fast closed up; just so these also, though ten thousand doctrines of salvation sound in their ears from all quarters, having their soul preoccupied with this passion, stop their ears against all discourses of that kind. And they know it well who have made the trial. But God forbid that you should know it from actual experience!" The LXX. has changed the allusion: "For a strange house is a pierced wine jar (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and a strange well is narrow," where the idea seems to be that the private well, which is dug for the convenience of one family only, is not to be relied upon, and will yield not enough to supply others' wants. Hence would arise a warning against coveting a neighbour's wife. There is a Greek proverb about drawing wine into pierced jars (Xen., 'OEcon.,' 7:40).

In this case the writer intends to denote the fantastic, often dreadful, images produced on the brain by the feverish condition of the inebriated. But the often denounced connection between drunkenness and incontinence, the constant reference to "strange women" in this book, and the general consensus of the versions, lead one to uphold the rendering of the Authorized Version. It seems, too, somewhat meagre to note these illusions as one of the terrible effects of intemperance, omitting all mention of the unbridling of lust, when the eyes look out for and rove after unchaste women. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart shall utter perverse things</span> (comp <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The drunkard's notions are distorted, and his words partake of the same character; he confuses right and wrong; he says things which he would never speak if he were in full possession of his senses.

Many understand the idea to be that the drunkard is compared to a man asleep in a frail boat, or to one slumbering on board a ship sunk in the trough of the sea. But the "lying" here does not imply sleep, but rather immersion. The inebriated person is assimilated to one who is drowned or drowning, who is cut off from all his former pursuits and interests in life, and has become unconscious of surrounding circumstances. This much more exactly represents the case than any notion of sloping amid danger. Septuagint, "Thou shalt lie as in the heart of the sea." <span class="cmt_word">Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast;</span> the extreme point of the sailyard, where no one could lie without the greatest peril of falling off. The drunkard is exposed to dangers of all kinds from being unable to take care of himself, and yet is all the time unconscious of his critical situation. Corn. a Lapide, followed by Plumptre, considers that the cradle, or look out, on the top of the mast is meant, where, if the watchman slept, he would be certain to endanger his life. Vulgate, "like a pilot fallen asleep, who has dropped the tiller," and is therefore on the way to shipwreck. Septuagint, "as a pilot in a great storm."

It is as though the drunkard has to yield to the effects of his excess and sleep off his intoxication, but he is. as it were, all the time longing to be able to rouse himself and recommence his orgies. We have had words put into the mouth of the sluggard (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>). The whole verse is rendered by the LXX thus: "Thou shalt say, They smote me, and I was not pained, and they mocked me, and I knew it not. When will it be morning, that I may go and seek those with whom I may consort?" The author of the 'Tractutus de Conscientia' appended to St. Bernard's works, applies this paragraph to the cuss of an evil conscience indurated by wicked habits and insensible to correction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/24.htm"><title>Proverbs 24 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/24.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/24.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/24-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/23.htm" title="Proverbs 23">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 24 <a href="../proverbs/25.htm" title="Proverbs 25">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a></div><div class="verse">Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - We return here to the more usual form, the tetrastich. <span class="cmt_word">Be not thou envious against evil men</span> (see on Proverbs 23:17, where a similar warning is given, and comp.

"Wisdom" (<span class="accented">chochmoth</span>) is in the plural number, intimating the various attributes connoted by it, or the different aspects in which it may be regarded (see note on Proverbs 1:20). "Too high" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ramoth</span>) is also plural; and Delitzsch and Nowack take it to mean, not so much "high things" as "precious things," such as pearls or precious stones, in accordance with <a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, "No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; yea,. the price of wisdom is above rubies." In this sense Delitzsch translates, "Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity," a costly and unnecessary appendage, which is not worth the sacrifices entailed by its pursuit. Whichever way we take it, the point is the rarity and inaccessibility of wisdom, and the repugnance of fools to make any exertion in order to obtain it. St. Augustine thus sums up the steps by which wisdom is reached: fear of God, piety, knowledge, fortitude, mercifulness, sincerity ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 2:7). <span class="cmt_word">He openeth not him month in the gate.</span> When men gather in the usual place of assembly (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>), to take counsel on public matters, he has nothing to say; he listens fatuously, and is silent. Septuagint, "Wisdom and good thought are in the gates of the wise; the wise turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, but reason in assemblies."

The stoner is the real fool, m that he does not pursue his proper end, prepares misery for himself, is blind to his best interests. The connection between sin and folly, as between wisdom and righteousness, is continually enforced throughout the book. <span class="cmt_word">The scorner is an abomination</span> <span class="cmt_word">to men.</span> The man who scoffs at religion and every high aim is an object of abomination to the pious, and is also a cause of evil to others, leading them to thoughts and acts which are hateful in the eyes of God.

So we may say in English, "If thou faint in time of straitness, straitened is thy strength." If you fail, and succumb to anxiety or danger, instead of rising to meet the emergency, then you are but a weakling or a coward, and the strength which you seemed to possess and of which you boasted, perhaps, is nothing worth. Such a man hearkens not to the Sibyl's counsel (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 6:95) ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito,<br />Quam tua te fortuna sinet."</span> The LXX. again varies from the received text, "He shall be polluted in an evil day, and in a day of affliction, until he fail," or "die" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>).

"would that!" So the first hemistich should be rendered, "Deliver them that are haled to death," and the second, "And those that are tottering to slaughter, oh, hold them back!" The sentence is somewhat obscure, but Cheyne well explains it thus: "Some victims of a miscarriage of justice are about to be dragged away to execution, and the disciple of wisdom is exhorted to use his endeavours to deliver them" ('Job and Solomon'). In the case supposed a moral obligation lies on the pious and well-informed to save a human life unjustly imperilled. At the same time, there is nothing in the passage which absolutely, shows that the punishment of the guiltless is here deprecated; it looks rather as if Wisdom had no pleasure in the death of men, innocent or not, and that the victims of an extreme sentence claimed pity at her hands, whatever might be the circumstances of the verdict. Septuagint, "Deliver those that are being led away to death, and redeem (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) those that are appointed to be slain; spare not (to help them)" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3, 4</a>).

The LXX. makes it a personal matter, ignoring the plural form of the previous paragraph. "I know him not, he is no friend of mine; why should I trouble myself about him?" Such a selfish person, like the priest and Levite in the parable, would "pass by on the other side." <span class="cmt_word">Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?</span> God knows the truth - knows that the excuse is vain; for he is the Weigher and Searcher of hearts (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).

But the verb <span class="accented">naphal</span> seems not to be used in the sense of "falling" morally; and the meaning here is that the just man frequently falls into trouble, - he is not secure against worldly cares and losses, or the insidious attacks of the man mentioned in Ver. 15; but he never loses his trust in God or offends by fretfulness and impatience, and always God's providence watches over him and delivers him out of all his afflictions. "Seven times" means merely often, that number being used to express plurality or completeness (see on Proverbs 6:31; 26:16; and comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> (which is like our passage); and <a href="../../par/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>). The expectation which the sinner conceived when he saw the good man distressed, that he might seize the opportunity and use it to his own benefit, is woefully disappointed. In contrast with the recovery and reestablishment of the righteous, when the wicked suffer calamity there is no recuperation for them. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked shall fall into mischief;</span> Revised Version better, <span class="accented">are overthrown by calamity</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and note there). Septuagint," But the ungodly shall be weak in evils." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a></div><div class="verse">Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - A warning against vindictiveness, nearly approaching the great Christian maxim, "Love your enemies" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth.</span> "Thou shalt love thy neighbour" was a Mosaic precept (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>); the addition, "and hate thine enemy," was a Pharisaic gloss, arising from a misconception concerning the extermination of the Canaanites, which, indeed, had a special cause and purpose, and was not a precedent for the treatment of all aliens (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When he stumbleth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when he is overthrown</span>. The maxim refers to private enemies. The overthrow of public enemies was often celebrated with festal rejoicing. Thus we have the triumph of Moses at the defeat of the Amalekites, and over Pharaoh's host at the Red Sea; of Deborah and Barak over Sisera (<a href="../../par/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>); and the psalmist, exulting over the destruction of his country's foes, could say, "The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). But private revenge and vindictiveness are warmly censured and repudiated. So Cato, 'Distich.' 4:46 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum;<br />Felicesobeunt quorum sine crimine vita est."</span> Of very different tone is the Italian proverb, "Revenge is a morsel for God;" and "Wait time and place to act thy revenge, for it is never well done in a hurry" (Trench). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-18.htm">Proverbs 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him.</span> This malignant pleasure at others' misfortunes (which Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 2:7. 15, calls <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is a sin in the eyes of God, and calls for punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And he turn away his wrath from him;</span> and, as is implied, direct it upon thee. But it seems a mean motive to adduce, if the maxim is taken baldly to mean, "Do not rejoice at your enemy's calamity, lest God relieve him from the evil:" for true charity would wish for such a result. Bode considers "his wrath" to be the enemy's ill will against thee, which God by his grace changes to love, and thou art thus covered with confusion and shame for thy former vindictiveness. But the point is not so much the removal of God's  displeasure from the enemy as the punishment of the malignant man, either mentally or materially. To a malignant mind no severer blow could be given than to see a foe recover God's favor and rise from his fall. The moralist then warns the disciple against giving way to this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> lest he prepare for himself bitter mortification by having to witness the restoration of the hated one, or by being himself made to suffer that evil which he had rejoiced to see his neighbour experience (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>, and note there). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19</a></div><div class="verse">Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - A warning against envying the prosperity of the wicked. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Fret not thyself because of evil men (comp. Ver. 1 and <a href="../../par/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>). The verb (<span class="accented">charah</span>) means "to burn," "to be angry;" so here we may render, "Be not enraged on account of evil doers." The anger would arise on account of the apparent inequitable distribution of blessings. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ne contendas cum pessimis</span>; Septuagint, "Rejoice not over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) evildoers." <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious at the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not fancy that their prosperity is to be desired, nor be led to imitate their doings in order to secure like success.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies transitively "to repeat," and intransitively "to be changed;" so it may be most accurately translated here, with Delitzsch, "those who are otherwise disposed," who have not the proper sentiments of fear and honour for God and the king. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Et cum detractoribus non commiscearis</span>, by which word he probably means what we call revolutionists, persons who disparage and despise all authority. Septuagint, "Fear God and the king, and disobey neither of them." The verse has been largely used as a text by preachers who desired to recommend loyalty and to censure disaffection and rebellion. It has been a favourite motto for discourses on the Gunpowder Treason and the execution of Charles I. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For their calamity shall rise suddenly.</span> Though these dissidents seem to succeed for a time, yet retribution shall fall suddenly upon them. <span class="cmt_word">And who knoweth the ruin of them both?</span> This seems to mean the two classes, those who dishonour God and those who dishonour the king; but no such distinction is made in the previous verse; the rebels are classed under one category. Wordsworth renders, "the stroke of vengeance from them both," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from God and the king. Otherwise, we must give another signification to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of "years," which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> will bear, as <a href="../../par/job/36-11.htm">Job 36:11</a>, and translate, "The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, "For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)?" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: "A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles." The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1-14</a>) called in the Hebrew, "The words of Agur." The second part of "the words of Agur," and "the words of Lemuel" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-31:9</a>) follow in the Greek after <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a> of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30-31:9</a>) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after "the words of the wise" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17-24:22</a>), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23-34</a>).  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-34.</span> - Part V.

The following proverbs, as well as the preceding, are derived from wise men. Mistaking this superscription, the LXX. makes it a personal address: "This I say to you who are wise, so that ye may learn." The first line is not a proverb, but the introduction to the ensuing collection. <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>, and note there; and <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>, where the expression is the same as here). To regard one person before another is to be partial and unjust. To say this error is "not good" is a meiosis, the meaning being that it is very evil and sinful (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>). The statement is developed and confirmed in the next two verses, which show the results of partiality and its opposite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a></div><div class="verse">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous.</span> The judge is supposed to be acquitting a guilty person. <span class="cmt_word">Him shall the people curse.</span> The Hebrew is "peoples," as Septuagint and Vulgate, <span class="accented">maledicient eis populi</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Nations shall abhor him.</span> Not individuals, nor families only, but the whole community, wherever such an iniquitous ruler is found, shall execrate and hate him. The voice of the people is universally against him; no one is so blind and degraded as openly to applaud his nets. The verb <span class="accented">nakab</span>, "to curse," means primarily "to bore or pierce;" hence some have translated it here, "him shall the peoples stab." But the word is used in the sense of distinguishing by a mark or brand, and thence passes into the sense of cursing, as at <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a> the unjust judge is called an abomination to the Lord.

An answer that is fair and suitable to the circumstances is as pleasant and assuring to the bearers as a kiss on the lips. Such a salutation would be a natural sign of sympathy and affection. Thus Absalom won the hearts of the people by kissing those who came to court with their suits (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5</a>). In <a href="../../par/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>, where the Authorized Version has, "According to thy word shall all my people be ruled," the Hebrew runs, "Thy mouth shall all my people kiss," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they shall do homage to thee, which is another signification of this action. This, however, would not be suitable here, as the kiss is supposed to be given by the speaker, though the LXX. mistakenly translates, "But men will kiss lips that answer good words."

That is, in short, steadily and with due foresight cultivate your land; provide abundant means of subsistence before you attempt to build up your house. A suitor had, as it were, to purchase his bride from her relations by making considerable presents; it was therefore necessary to provide a certain amount of wealth before contemplating matrimony. <span class="cmt_word">And afterwards build thy house.</span> This is, indeed, the meaning of the passage; but the Hebrew makes a difficulty, as it is literally, "afterwards and thou shalt build."

The two verses are thus rendered, or morally applied, in the Septuagint: "A foolish man is as a farm. and a man wanting in sense is as a vineyard; if you leave him, he will be barren, and will be altogether covered with weeds, and he will become deserted, and his fences of stone are broken down."

There are numberless proverbs dedicated to this subject in all languages; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "No sweat, no sweet;" "No pains, no gains; .... He that wad eat the kernel maun crack the nut;" "A punadas entran las buenas hadas," "Good luck enters by dint of cuffs" (Spanish); "Nihil agendo male agere discimus; .... The dog in the kennel," say the Chinese. "barks at his fleas; the dog that hunts does not feel them" (Kelly). "Sloth and much sleep," say the Arabs, "remove from God and bring on poverty." The LXX. is somewhat dramatic in its rendering: "Afterwards I repented (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), I looked that I might receive instruction.

But if thou do this, thy poverty will come advancing, and thy want like a good runner (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>, but nowhere else in the Septuagint. It is used by St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/9-36.htm">Mark 9:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>). It has been thought that the original <span class="accented">mashal</span> ended with Ver. 32, the following passage being added by a scribe as illustrative in a marginal note, which afterwards crept into the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

SECOND GREAT COLLECTION OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS, gathered by "the men of Hezekiah," in which wisdom is set forth as the greatest blessing to the king and his subjects. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription: <span class="cmt_word"></span>These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out.</span> The word "also" implies that a previous collection was known to the compiler of the present book - probably the one which we have in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10-22:16</a>, of which nine proverbs are inserted here. But there was still a large number of proverbial sayings attributed to Solomon, and preserved partly by oral tradition and partly in writing, which it was advisable to collect and secure before they were lost. The zeal of Hezekiah took this in hand. He was not, as far as we know, an author himself, but he evidently felt a warm interest in literature, and "the men of Hezekiah," not mentioned elsewhere, must have been his counsellors and scholars, to whom was entrusted the duty of gathering together into a volume the scattered sayings of the wise king. Among those contemporaries, doubtless, Isaiah was eminent, and it is not improbable that Shebna the scribe and Josh the chronicler were members of the learned fraternity (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>). The verb rightly translated "copied out" (<span class="accented">athak</span>) means, properly, "to remove," "to transfer" from one place to another (<span class="accented">transtulerunt</span>, Vulgate); hence it signifies here to copy into a book words taken from other writings or people's mouths. The sayings thus collected, whether truly Solomon's or not, were extant under his name, and were regarded as worthy of his reputation for wisdom. The title is given in the Septuagint, thus: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is uncertain. It has been translated "impossible to distinguish," equivalent to "miscellaneous;" "beyond doubt," equivalent to "genuine," "hard to interpret," as in Polyb., 15:12, 9. St. James (<a href="../../par/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>) applies the term to wisdom, but the interpreters there are not agreed as to the meaning, it being rendered "without partiality," "without variance," "without doubtfulness," etc. It seems best to take the word as used by the LXX. to signify "mixed," or "miscellaneous." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-7.</span> - Proverbs concerning kings. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.</span> That which is the chief glory of God is his mysteriousness, the unfathomable character of his nature and attributes and doings. The more we search into these matters, the more complete we find our ignorance to be; finite faculties are utterly unable to comprehend the infinite; they can embrace merely what God chooses to reveal. "Secret things belong unto the Lord our God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>), and the great prophet, favoured with Divine revelations, can only confess, "Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself" <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>; comp <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</span> The same word is used for "glory" and "honour" in both clauses, and ought to have been rendered similarly. It is the king's glory to execute justice and to defend the rights and safety of his people. To do this effectually he must investigate matters brought before him, look keenly into political difficulties, get to the bottom of all  complications, and watch against possible dangers. The contrast between the glory of God and that of the king lies in this - that whereas both God and the king desire man's welfare, the former promotes this by making him feel his ignorance and littleness and entire dependence upon this mysterious Being whose nature and designs mortals cannot understand; the latter advances the good of his subjects by giving them confidence in his zeal and power to discover truth, and using his knowledge for their benefit. Septuagint, "The glory of God concealeth a word (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>): but the glory of a king honoureth matters (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3</a></div><div class="verse">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - This proverb is connected with the preceding by the idea of "searching" (<span class="accented">chakar</span>) common to both. Such emblematic proverbs are common in this second collection (see Ver. 11). Three subjects are stated, of which is predicated the term unsearchable, viz. <span class="cmt_word">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings.</span> As you can never rise to the illimitable height of the heavens, as you can never penetrate to the immeasurable depth of the earth, so you can never fathom the heart of a king, can never find out what he really thinks and intends (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>). It may be that tacitly a warning is intended against flattering one's sell that one knows and can reckon on the favour of a king; his good disposition towards you may be only seeming, or may any moment become changed. The Septuagint has for "unsearchable" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "unquestionable." The commentators refer to a passage in Tacitus ('Ann.' 6:8), where M. Terentius defends himself for being a friend of Sejanus by the fact of the impossibility of investigating a great man's real sentiments. "To us," he says to Tiberius, "it appertains not to judge whom you exalt above all others and for what reason you do so. Facts which are obvious we all notice. We see who is the man upon whom you heap wealth and honours, who it is that has the chief power of dispensing rewards and punishments; that these were possessed by Sejanus no one can deny. But to pry into the hidden thoughts of a prince, and the designs which he meditates in secret, is unlawful and hazardous; nor would the attempt succeed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - A tetrastich in an emblematical form. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the dross from the silver</span>. Silver was most extensively used by the Hebrews (see 'Dictionary of the Bible,' <span class="accented">sub voc</span>.), whether obtained from native mines or imported from foreign countries, and the process of separating the ore from the extraneous matters mixed with it was well known (<a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, etc.; see on Proverbs 17:3). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there shall come forth a</span> <span class="cmt_word">vessel for the finer</span> (<span class="accented">tsaraph</span>); the goldsmith. The pure silver is ready for the artist s work, who from this material can make a beautiful vessel. Septuagint, "Beat untested silver, and all shall be made entirely pure," where the allusion is to the process of reducing minerals by lamination. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the wicked from before the king.</span> Let the wicked be removed from the presence of the king, as dross is separated from the pure silver (see the same metaphor, <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And his throne shall be established in righteousness</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>: 29:14). The king detects the evil and punishes them; and this confirms his rule and secures the continuance of his dynasty. Thus righteousness triumphs, and wickedness is properly dealt with. Septuagint, "Slay the ungodly from the face of the king, and his throne shall prosper in righteousness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Another proverb (a pentastich) connected with kings and great men. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king.</span> Do not make display of yourself as though vying with the king in outward circumstances. Septuagint, "Boast not thyself (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the presence of a king." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in the place of great men.</span> Do not pretend to be the equal of those who occupy high places in the kingdom (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>). Septuagint, "And take not your stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;</span>) in the places of chieftains." Says a Latin gnome, "Qui cum fortuna convenit, dives est;" and Ovid wrote well ('Trist.,' 3:4. 25, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crede mihi; bene qui latuit, bene vixit; et intra<br />Fortunam debet quisque manere suam...<br />Tu quoque formida nimium sublimia semper;<br />Propositique memor contrahe vela tui."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-7.htm">Proverbs 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither.</span> It is better for the prince to select you for elevation to a high post; to call you up near his throne. The reference is not necessarily to position at a royal banquet, though the maxim lends itself readily to such application. This warbling against arrogance and presumption was used by our blessed Lord in enforcing a lesson of humility and self-discipline (<a href="../../par/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>, etc ). Septuagint, "For it is better for thee that it should be said, Come up unto me (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>)" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span> The last words have been variously interpreted:  "to whom thou hast come with a request for preferment;" "into whose august presence thou hast been admitted, so as to see his face" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>); "who knows all about thee, and will thus make thee feel thy humiliation all the more." But <span class="accented">nadib</span>, rendered "prince," is not the king, but any noble or great man; and what the maxim means is this - that it is wise to save yourself from the mortification of being turned out of a place which you have knowingly usurped. Your own eyes see that he is in the company; you are aware of what is his proper position; you have occupied a post which belongs to another; justly you are removed, and all present witness your humiliation. The moralist knew that the bad spirit of pride was fostered and encouraged by every act of self-assertion; hence the importance of his warning. The Septuagint makes a separate sentence of these last words, "Speak thou of what thine eyes saw," or, perhaps, like St. Jerome, the Syriac, and Symmachus, attach them to the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-8.htm">Proverbs 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A tristich with no parallelism. <span class="cmt_word">Go not forth hastily to strive.</span> The idea is either of one entering into litigation with undue haste, or of one hurrying to meet an adversary. St. Jerome, taking in the final words of the previous verse, renders, <span class="accented">Quae viderunt oculi tui</span>, <span class="accented">ne proferas in jurgio cito</span>, "What thine eyes have seen reveal not hastily in a quarrel." This is like Ver. 9 below, and Christ's injunction, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone" (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof.</span> The Hebrew is elliptical, "Lest by chance (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) thou do something (bad, humiliating) in the end thereof." But Delitzsch, Nowack, and others consider the sentence as interrogative (as <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>), and translate, "That it may not be said in the end thereof, What wilt thou do?" Either way, the warning comes to this - Do not enter hastily upon strife of any kind, lest thou be utterly at a loss what to do. When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame, by putting thee in the wrong, gaining his cause, or getting the victory over thee in some way. Septuagint, "Fall not quickly into a contest, lest thou repent at the last." There is an English proverb, "Anger begins with folly and ends with repentance;" and "Haste is the beginning of wrath, its end is repentance." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-9.htm">Proverbs 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - A tetrastich without parallelism, connected with the preceding maxim. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>; see on ver. 8). If you have any quarrel with a neighbour, or are drawn into a controversy with him, deal with him privately in a friendly manner. <span class="cmt_word">And discover not a secret to another;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the secret of another</span>. Do not bring in a third party, or make use of anything entrusted to you by another person, or of which you have become privately informed, in order to support your cause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-10.htm">Proverbs 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest he that heareth it</span> <span class="cmt_word">put thee to shame;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. lest any one, not the offended neighbour only, who hears how treacherous you have been, makes your proceeding known and cries shame upon you. <span class="cmt_word">And thine infamy turn not away.</span> The stigma attached to you be never obliterated. Thus Siracides: "Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbour" (Ecclus. 27:16, etc.; comp. also 22:22). The motive presented in our text is not the highest, being grounded on the fear of shame and disgrace in men's eyes; but it is a very potent incentive to right action, and the moralist has good reason for employing it. That it does not reach to the height of Christian morality is obvious. The gnome is thus given in the Greek: "When thy friend shall reproach thee, retreat backward, despise him not, lest thy friend reproach thee still; and so thy quarrel and enmity shall not pass away, but shall be to thee like death." Then the LXX. adds a paragraph, reproduced partly by St. Jerome, "Kindness and friendship set a man free (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); preserve thou these, that thou become not liable to reproach (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">exprobabilis</span>); but guard thy ways in a conciliating spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)."

In the latter case the phrase may mean a word quickly formed, or moving easily, spoken <span class="accented">ore rotundo</span>, or a speedy answer. But the metaphor is unusual and inappropriate; and it is best to understand a word spoken under due consideration of time and place. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui loquitur verbum in tempore suo</span>; Aquila and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in circumstances that suit it;" the Septuagint has simply <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Is like <span class="cmt_word">apples of gold in pictures of silver.</span> In these emblematical distichs the words, "is like," in the Authorized Version, are an insertion. The Hebrew places the two ideas merely in sequence; the object with which some, thing is compared usually coming before, that which is compared with it, as here, "Apples of gold - a word fitly spoken" (so  in vers. 14, 18, 19, 26, 28). There is a doubt about the meaning of the word rendered "pictures," <span class="accented">maskith</span> (see on Proverbs 18:11). It seems to be used generally in the sense of "image," "sculpture," being derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to see;" from this it comes to signify "ornament," and here most appropriately is "basket," and, as some understand, of filagree work. St. Jerome mistakes the word, rendering, <span class="accented">in lectis argenteis</span>. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "on a necklace of sardius." "Apples of gold" are apples or other fruits of a golden colour, not made of gold, which would be very costly and heavy; nor would the comparison with artificial fruits be as suitable as that with natural. The "word" is the fruit set off by its circumstances, as the latter's beauty is enhanced by the grace of the vessel which contains it. The "apple" has been supposed to be the orange (called in late Latin <span class="accented">pomum aurantium</span>) or the citron. We may cite here the opinion of a competent traveller: "For my own part," says Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 605), "I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that the <span class="accented">apricot</span> alone is the 'apple' of Scripture Everywhere the apricot is common; perhaps it is, with the single exception of the fig, the most abundant fruit of the country. In highlands and lowlands alike, by the shores of the Mediterranean and on the banks of the Jordan, in the nooks of Judea, under the heights of Lebanon, in the recesses of Galilee, and in the glades of Gilead, the apricot flourishes, and yields a crop of prodiscus abundance. Its characteristics meet every condition of the 'tappuach' of Scripture. 'I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste' (<a href="../../par/songs/2-3.htm">Song of Solomon 2:3</a>). Near Damascus, and on the banks of the Barada, we have pitched our tents under its shade, and spread our carpets secure from the rays of the sun. 'The smell of thy nose (shall be) like tappuach' (<a href="../../par/songs/7-8.htm">Song of Solomon 7:8</a>). There can scarcely be a more deliciously perfumed fruit than the apricot; and what fruit can better fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of <span class="accented">gold</span> in pictures of silver,' than this golden fruit, as its branches bend under the weight in their setting of bright yet pale foliage?" Imagery similar to that found in this verse occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inauris aurea et margaritum fulgens</span>, "A golden earring and a brilliant pearl." Septuagint, "A golden earring a precious sardius also is set." So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. The obedient ear receives the precepts of the wise reprover, and wears them as a valued ornament.

This luxury was not unknown in the time of Solomon, who had a summer palace on Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>), though it could have been enjoyed by very few, and would not speak to the personal experience of the burgher class, to whom the proverbs seem to have been addressed. Xenophon writes of the use of snow to cool wine ('Memorab.,' 2:1. 30). Hitzig quotes a passage from the old history of the Crusades, called 'Gesta Dei per Francos,' which runs thus: "Nix frigidissima a monte Libano defertur, ut vino commixta, tanquam glaciem ipsum frigidum reddat." So in the present day snow is sold in Damascus bazaars. The LXX., not realizing what harm such an untimely storm might effect, translates, "As a fall (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of snow in harvest is of use against heat, so a faithful messenger benefits those who sent him." So is a faithful messenger to them that send him. (For "faithful messenger," see on Proverbs 13:17; and for "them that send," see on Proverbs 22:21.) The comparison is explained. <span class="cmt_word">For he refresheth the soul of his masters.</span> He brings as great refreshment to his masters' mind as would a drink of snow-cooled water in the burning harvest field.

The proverb is concerned with promises disappointed. Clouds and wind are generally in the East the precursors of heavy rain, as we read in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>, "In a little while the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain." After  such phenomena, which, according to current meteorological observation, gave every hope of a refreshing shower in the time of summer drought, to see the clouds pass away without affording a single drop of rain is a grievous disappointment. The metaphor is found in the New Testament. St. Jude (Ver. 12) calls false teachers "clouds without water, carried along by winds." "A gift of falsehood," equivalent to "a false gift," one that deceives, because it is only promised and never given. A man makes a great parade of going to bestow a handsome present, and then sneaks out of it, and gives nothing. Such a one is, as St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Vir gloriosus</span>, <span class="accented">et promissa non complens</span>.

The Septuagint is incorrect, "As winds, and clouds, and rains are most evident (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), so is he who boasts of a false gift."

"Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo." Similar proverbs are found elsewhere, though probably in a different sense. Thus in modern Greek, "The tongue has no bones, yet it breaks bones;" in Turkish, "The tongue has no bone, yet it crushes;" again, "One drop of honey," says the Turk, "catches more bees than a ton of vinegar."

The mind may be overloaded as well as the body: only such instruction as can be digested and assimilated is serviceable to the spiritual nature; injudicious cramming produces satiety and disgust. Again, "To 'find honey,'" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 16:8), "is to taste the sweetness of holy intelligence, which is eaten enough of then when our perception, according to the measure of our faculty, is held tight under control. For he is 'filled with honey, and vomits it' who, in seeking to dive deeper than he has capacity for, loses that too from whence he might have derived nourishment." And in another place (ibid., 20:18), "The sweetness of spiritual meaning he who seeks to eat beyond what he contains, even what he had eaten he 'vomiteth;' because, whilst he seeks to make out things above, beyond his powers, even the things that he had made out aright, he forfeits" (Oxford transl.).

Do not pay too frequent visits  to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, "Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.

But them is some doubt about the rendering of the first clause. The Authorized Version has the authority of the Syriac, Aquila, and others, and gives an appropriate sense, the unreasonable proceeding being the laying aside of some of one's own clothes in cold weather. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">adah</span>), may also mean "to adorn," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, with fine garments; hence some expositors understand the incongruity to be the dressing one's self in gay apparel in winter. But, as Delitzsch remarks, there is no reason why fine clothes should not be warm; and if they are so, there is nothing unreasonable in wearing them. The rendering of our version is probably correct. St. Jerome annexes this line to the preceding verse, as if it confirmed the previous instances of misplaced confidence, <span class="accented">Et amittit pallium in die frigoris</span>. "Such a one loses his cloak in a day of frost." <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar upon nitre.</span> Our nitre, or saltpetre, is nitrate of potash, which is not the substance intended by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nether</span>). The substance signified by this term is a natural alkali, known to the ancients as natron, and composed of carbonate of soda with some other admixture. It was used extensively for washing purposes, and in cookery and bread making. It effervesces with an acid, such as vinegar, and changes its character, becoming a salt, and being rendered useless for all the purposes to which it was applied in its alkaline condition. So he who pours vinegar on natron does a foolish thing, for he spoils a highly useful article, and produces one which is of no service to him. Septuagint, "As vinegar is inexpedient for a wound (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), so suffering falling on the body pains the heart." Schulteus, Ewald, and others, by referring <span class="accented">nether</span> to an Arabic source, obtain the meaning "wound," or "sore," titus: "As vinegar on a sore." This gives a most appropriate sense, and might well be adopted if it had sufficient authority. But this is doubtful. Cornelius a Lapide translates the Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sicut acetum trahit inutile;" and explains that vinegar draws from the soil the nitre which is prejudicial to vegetation, and thus renders ground fertile - a fact in agricultural chemistry not generally known, though Columella vouches for it. A somewhat similar fact, however, is of common experience. Land occasionally becomes what farmers term "sour," and is thus sterile; if it is then dressed with salt. its fertillity is restored. So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. The inconsistency lies in thinking to cheer a sorrowful heart by singing merry songs. "A tale out of season," says Siracides, "is as music in mourning" (Ecclus. 22:6). The Greeks denoted cruel incongruity by the proverb, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; "Ludere inter maerentes." As the old hymn says -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Strains of gladness<br />Suit not souls with anguish torn."</span> The true Christian sympathy teaches to "rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them that weep" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). Plumptre, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' suggests that the effervescence caused by the mixture of acid and alkali is taken as a type of the irritation produced by the inopportune songs. But this is importing a modern view into a paragraph, such as would never have occurred to the writer. The Septuagint, followed partially by Jerome, the Syriac, and the Targum, introduces another proverb not found in the Hebrew, "As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man hurts his heart."

Thus Elisha treated the Syrians, introduced blindly into the midst of Samaria, ordering the King of Israel to set bread and water before them, and to send them away unharmed (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a>). "Punish your enemy by benefiting him," say the Arabs, though they are far from practising the injunction; "Sweet words break the bones;" "Bread and salt humble even a robber," say the Russians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a></div><div class="verse">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</span> This expression has been taken in various senses. It has been thought to mean that the forgiveness of the injured person brings to the cheek of the offender the burning blush of shame. But heaping coals on the head cannot naturally be taken to express such an idea. St. Chrysostom and other Fathers consider that Divine vengeance is implied, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, "Upon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be their portion;" and <a href="../../par/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>, "Let burning coals fall upon them." Of course, in one view, kindness to an evil man only gives him occasion for fresh ingratitude and hatred, and therefore increases God's wrath against him. But it would be a wicked motive to act this beneficent part only to have the satisfaction of seeing your injurer humbled or punished. And the gnome implies that the sinner is benefited by the clemency shown to him, that the requital of evil by good brings the offender to a better mind, and aids his spiritual life. "Coals of fire" are a metaphor for the penetrating pain of remorse and repentance. The unmerited kindness which he receives forces upon him the consciousness of his ill doing, which is accompanied by the sharp rain of regret. St. Augustine, "Ne dubitaveris figurate dictum...ut intelligas carbones ignis esse urentes poenitentiae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur ejus, qui dolit se inimicum fuisse hominis, a quo ejus miseriae subvenitur" ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 3:16). Lesetre quotes St. Francis de Sales, who gives again a different view, "You are not obliged to seek reconciliation with one who has offended you; it may be rather his part to seek you; yet nevertheless go and follow the Saviour's counsel, prevent him with good, render him good for evil: heap coals of fire on his head and on his heart, which may burn up all ill will and constrain him to love you" ('De l'Am. de Dieu,' 8:9). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord shall reward thee.</span> This consideration can scarcely be regarded as the chief motive for the liberality enjoined, though it would be present to the kind person's mind, and be a support and comfort to him in a course of conduct repugnant to the natural man. He would remember the glorious reward promised to godliness by the prophet (<a href="../../par/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, etc.), and how Saul had expressed his consciousness of David's magnanimity in sparing his life. "Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil...  wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17, 19</a> and 1 Sam 26:21). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a></div><div class="verse">The north wind driveth away rain: so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The north wind driveth away rain.</span> So St. Jerome (<span class="accented">Ventus</span> <span class="accented">Aquilo dissipat pluvias</span>), Symmachus, Aben Ezra, and others. The north wind is called by the natives of Palestine "the heavenly," from the bright effect which it produces in the sky. "By means of the north wind cometh he (the sun) forth as gold" (<a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>). But the verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means "to bring forth, produce" (<a href="../../par/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>); hence the Revised Version rightly renders, "The north wind bringeth forth rain." This is quite true if "north wind" be taken as equivalent to "wind from the dark quarter" (Umbreit), like <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek; and, in fact, the northwest wind in Palestine does bring rain. Septuagint, "The north wind arouseth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) clouds." <span class="cmt_word">So doth an angry countenance a backbiting, tongue.</span> Carrying on the interpretation intended by the Authorized Version, this clause means that an angry leer will check a slanderer and incline him to hold his peace from prudential motives. But with the rendering given above, "bringeth forth," another explanation is involved, viz. "So does a secret, slandering tongue cause a troubled countenance." When a man discovers that a secret slanderer is working against him, he shows it by his gloomy and angry look, as the sky is dark  with clouds when a storm is threatened. "Countenance" is plural in the Hebrew, denoting, as Hitzig points out, that the calumniator does not affect one person only, but occasions trouble far and wide, destroys friendly relations between many, excites suspicion and enmity in various quarters Septuagint, "An impudent countenance provokes the tongue."

The relief to the latter, when they receive good news of the wanderer, is as refreshing as a draught of cool water to a fainting, weary man. We do not know that the Hebrews were great travellers in those days; but any communication from a distant country would be very uncertain in arriving at its destination, and would at any rate take a long time in transmission, in most cases there would be nothing to rest upon but vague report, or a message carried by some travelling merchant. There is a somewhat similar proverb found at Ver. 13 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>. The ancient commentators have seen in this news from a distant country the announcement of Christ's birth by the angels at Bethlehem, or the preaching of the gospel that tells of the joys of heaven, the land that is very far off (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-26.htm">Proverbs 25:26</a></div><div class="verse">A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Hebrew (see on Ver. 11), <span class="cmt_word">A troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring - a righteous man giving way to the wicked.</span> A good man neglecting to assert himself and to hold his own m the face of sinners, is as useless to society and as harmful to the good cause as a spring that has been defiled by mud stirred up or extraneous matter introduced is unserviceable for drinking and prejudicial to those who use it. The mouth of the righteous should be "a well of life" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>), wholesome, refreshing, helpful; his conduct should be consistent and straightforward, fearless in upholding the right (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, etc.), uncompromising in opposing sin. When such a man, for fear, or favour, or weakness, or weariness, yields to the wicked, compromises principle, no longer makes a stand for truth and purity and virtue, he loses his high character, brings a scandal on religion, and lowers his own spiritual nature. It is this moral cowardice which Christ so sternly rebukes (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>), "Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." Some have assumed that the gnome is concerned with a good man's fall into misfortune owing to the machinations of sinners; but in this case the comparison loses its force; such persecution would not disturb the purity or lower the character of the righteous man; it would rather enhance his good qualities, give occasion for their exercise and development, and therefore could not be described as fouling a pure spring. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to eat much honey</span>. The ill effects of a surfeit of honey have been already mentioned (Ver. 16); but here the application is different, and occasions some difficulty. The Authorized Version, in order to clear up the obscurity of the text, inserts a negative, <span class="cmt_word">So for men to search their own glory is not glory,</span> which seems to be a warning against conceit and self-adulation. This is hardly warranted by the present Hebrew text, which is literally, as Venetian renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, "The search of their glory [is] glory." But who are meant by "their"? No persons are mentioned in the verse to whom the suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> can be referred, and it is not improbable that some words have dropped out of the text. At the same time, we might naturally in thought supply "for men" after "it is not good," such omissions being not uncommon in proverbial sayings; the suffix then would refer to them. Commentators have endeavoured to amend the text by alterations which do not commend themselves. Schultens supposes that the suffix had reference to the Divine law and revelations, and, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> may mean both "glory" and "weight," translates, "Vestigatio gravitatis eorum, gravitas." Bertheau takes <span class="accented">kabod</span> in two different senses, "The searching out of their glory is a burden." So Delitzsch, by little manipulation of the pointing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) obtains the rendering, "But to search out hard things is an honour." Taken thus, the maxim says that bodily pleasures sicken and cloy, but diligent study brings honour. This, however, is not satisfactory; it gives a word two different senses in the same clause, and it affords a very feeble contrast. One would naturally expect the proverb to say that the excess, which was deprecated in the first hemistich as regards one department, must be equally rejected in another sphere. This is somewhat the idea given by Jerome, <span class="accented">Sic qui scrutator est majestatis opprimetur a gloria</span>. The truth here stated will be explained by translating our text, "The investigation of weighty matters is a weight." Thus the clauses are shown to be well poised. Honey is good, study is good; but both may be used so as to be prejudicial. Eating may be carried to excess; study may attempt to investigate things too hard or too high. That this is a real danger we know well from the controversies about  predestination and elation in time past, and those concerning spiritualism and theurgy in our own day (see Jeremy Taylor, 'Certainty of Salvation,' 3:176, edit. Hebrews; and 'Holy Living,' ch. 3, &sect; 5). This is the view taken of the passage by St. Gregory ('Moral,' 14:32), 'If the sweetness of honey be taken in greater measure than there is occasion for, from the same source whence the palate is gratified, the life of the eater is destroyed.' The "searching into majesty" is also sweet; but he that seeks to dive into it deeper than the cognizance of human nature admits, finds the mere gloriousness thereof by itself oppresses him, in that, like honey taken in excess, it bursts the sense of the searcher which is not capable of holding it." And again (ibid., 20:18), "For the glory of the invisible Creator, which when searched into with moderation lifts us up, being dived into beyond our powers bears us down" (Oxford transl.). (Comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; Ecclus. 3:21, etc.) Septuagint, "To eat much honey is not good, but it behoves us to honor glorious sayings."

St. Jerome, by the addition of the words, <span class="accented">in loquendo</span>, applies the proverb to intemperance in language, "So is he who is not able to restrain his spirit in speaking." Commenting on this, St. Gregory ('Moral,' 7:59) says, "Because it is without the wall of silence, the city of the mind lies open to the darts of the enemy, and when it casts itself forth in words, it exhibits itself exposed to the adversary, and he gets the mastery of it without trouble, in proportion as the soul that he has to overcome combats against its own self by much talking" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/26.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 26"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 26" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm"><title>Proverbs 26 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/26.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/26.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/26-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/25.htm" title="Proverbs 25">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 26 <a href="../proverbs/27.htm" title="Proverbs 27">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a></div><div class="verse">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - Certain proverbs concerning the fool (<span class="accented">kesil</span>), with the exception, perhaps, of ver. 2 (see on Proverbs 1:22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest.</span> Snow in summer would be quite unnatural and unheard of (see on Proverbs 25:13). Rain falls in the usual course of things only at stated times; whence arose the phrase of "the early and of latter rains" (see on Proverbs 16:15). From spring to October or November was the dry season, and a storm at harvest time was regarded, not merely as destructive or inconvenient, but as portentous and even supernatural (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>, etc.). The two cases are types of all that is incongruous and unsuitable. The LXX., apparently regarding their experience in Egypt rather than the actual text, translate, "As dew in harvest, and as rain in summer." <span class="cmt_word">So honour is not seemly for a fool</span> (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>). It is quite out of place to show respect to a stupid and ungodly man, or to raise him to a post of dignity; such conduct will only confirm him in his folly, give others a wrong impression concerning him, and afford him increased power of mischief. The Greeks had a proverb about giving honour to unsuitable objects: they called it washing an ass's head with nitre.

The Authorized Version hardly gives the sense. The line should be rendered, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the sparrow in</span> (in respect of) <span class="accented">its wandering</span>, <span class="accented">as the swallow in its flying</span>. The point of comparison is the vagueness and aimlessness of the birds' flight, or the uselessness of trying to catch them in their course. <span class="cmt_word">So the curse causeless shall not come.</span> It shall, as it were, spend its force in the air, and fall not on the head on which it was invoked. A causeless curse is that which is uttered against one who has done nothing to deserve such denunciation. Septuagint, "As birds and sparrows fly, so a causeless (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) curse shall come upon no one" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-2.htm">Nehemiah 13:2</a>.) Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blessings star forth forever; but a curse<br />Is like a cloud - it passes."</span> Closely connected with the superstition that dreads a curse is that which is alarmed by omens. Against this irrational fear we find some Eastern proverbs directed; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "The jackal howls: will my old buffalo die?" "The dog barks - still the caravan passes: will the barking of the dog reach the skies?" (Lane). Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "not," the Keri reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "to him." This makes the proverb say that the unprovoked curse shall return upon him who uttered it. But this reading is not to be accepted, as it does not suit the terms of comparison, though it seems to have been used by St. Jerome, who translates, <span class="accented">Sic maledictum frustra prolatum in quempiam superveniet</span>. This retributive justice is often alluded to elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 27 (where see note). So we find in various languages proverbs to the same effect. Thus in English, "Harm watch, harm catch;" Spanish, "Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot;" Turkish, "Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost;" Yoruba, "Ashes always fly back in the face of him that throws them" (Trench).

The animals used in riding were the ass and mule, and sometimes the camel. The Eastern ass is really a fine animal, larger, more spirited, and more active than the poor creature which we are wont to see. Or the whip and bridle may be intended to apply to both animals, though divided between the two for rhythmical or antithetical reasons (see on Proverbs 10:1). <span class="cmt_word">A rod for the fool's back.</span> Sharp correction is beth useful and necessary for the fool (so <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>).

A man who is so silly as to employ such an unfit messenger, as it were, cuts off the feet which should bear him on his errand, and, instead of enjoying the satisfaction of seeing the business well performed, he will be mortified and damaged by the blunder and stupidity of his emissary. Septuagint, "He maketh for himself reproach from his own ways (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) who sendeth a word by a foulish messenger." The Vulgate reads the first participle in a passive sense, <span class="accented">claudus pedibus</span>; but this is uneccessary. We have similar phrases to "drinketh damage" elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a> "drinketh in iniquity;" 34:7, "drinketh up scorn;" and with a different word, <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>, "devoureth iniquity." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-7.htm">Proverbs 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">The legs of the lame are not equal: so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The legs of a lame man are not equal</span>. The first word of this verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, has occasioned some difficulty. It is considered as an imperative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, "draw off," "take away." Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But the verb seems never to have this meaning; nor, if it had, would the sense be very satisfactory, for. as Delitzsch points out, lame legs are better than none, and there is a great difference between the perfectly crippled or paralytic who has to be carried, and the lame man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>) who can limp or get along on crutches., And when we explain the proverb in this sense (as Plumptre), "Take away the legs of the lame man and the parable from the mouth of fools," for both alike ere useless to their possessors, and their loss would not be felt - we must recognize that the conclusion is not true. No one would think of amputating s man's legs simply because he was lame, and such a one's legs cannot be considered absolutely useless. Others regard the word as third plural kal, "the legs hang loose;" though the form is not sufficiently accounted for. All explanations of the word as a verbal form have such difficulties, that some take it as a noun, meaning "dancing," which is Luther's interpretation, "as dancing to a cripple, so it becometh a fool to talk of wisdom." But the word could never sightly anything but "limping," and could not express the elegant motion of dancing. The Authorized Version considers the Hebrew to mean, "are lifted up," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unequal, one being longer or stronger than the other; but this loses the force of the comparison. There seems to be no better interpretation than that mentioned above," The legs of the lame hang loose," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unserviceable, however sound in appearance. St. Jerome has expressed this, though in a strange fashion, "As it is vain for a lame man to have seemly legs." <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable in the mouth of a fool.</span> "Parable" (<span class="accented">mashal</span>), sententious saying, the enunciation of which, as well as the recital of stories, was always a great feature in Eastern companies, and afforded a test of a man's ability. A fool fails in the exhibition; he misses the point of the wise saying which he produces; it falls lame from his mouth, affords no instruction to others, and makes no way with its hearers. Siracides gives another reason for the incongruity, "A parable shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in its season" (Ecclus. 20:20). Septuagint, "Take away the motion of legs, and transgression (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Lag.) from the mouth of fools." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-8.htm">Proverbs 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <i>is</i> he that giveth honour to a fool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that bindeth a stone in a sling.</span> So Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. This gives a very good sense the point being either that the stone, after being firmly fitted in its place, quickly passes away from the sling, or, if more stress is laid on the word "bindeth," that the stone is so firmly fixed that it cannot be slung, and therefore never reaches the mark. The alternative rendering adopted by the Revised Version is this, "As a bag of gems in a heap of stones;" where the incongruity would consist either in exposing jewels on a cairn, or sepulchral monument, whence they could easily be filched, or in attracting undesirable attention. But there are grammatical and etymological reasons against this interpretation; and the Authorized Version is to be considered correct. The Vulgate is curious: <span class="accented">Sieur qui mittit lapidem in acervum Mercurii</span>. This rendering points to the custom, with which Jerome must have been familiar, of erecting statues of Mercury on the highways, which were thus placed under his protection. Round these statues were ranged heaps of stones, to which every wayfarer contributed by throwing a pebble as he passed. The absence of the critical faculty which discerned no absurdity in this anachronism is sufficiently remarkable. The Latin saying  seems intended to denote useless labour, as we speak of "carrying coals to Newcastle." <span class="cmt_word">So is he that giveth honour to a fool.</span> You pay respect to a fool, or place him in an honourable position, but your labour is wasted; he cannot act up to his dignity, he cannot maintain the honour; it passes away like the stone from the sling, or, if it remains, it is useless to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard.</span> There is here no idea of the drunkard's hand being pierced with a thorn while he is insensible to the pain, but rather of his being armed with it, and ripe for mischief. So it is best to render, "A thornbush cometh into the hand of a drunkard;" he somehow gets possession of it, and in his stupid excitement is liable to become dangerous. Some understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> of the growth of the thorn; thus the Septuagint, "Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard;" Vulgate, "As if a thorn grew in the hand of a drunkard." But one does not see the bearing of such an expression; and the translation given above is more appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable,</span> etc. (as ver. 7). In that passage the wise saying in a fool's mouth was compared with something useless, here it is compared with something injurious. He employs it purposely to wound others; or by the ignorant use of some sharp-edged word he does much mischief. In this hemistich the LXX. has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;</span> with a different vocalization, and renders, "servitude (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in the hand of fools." This seems to mean that it comes natural to fools to be manacled and restrained by force. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/26-10.htm">Proverbs 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">The great <i>God</i> that formed all <i>things</i> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Few passages have given greater difficulty than this verse; almost every word has been differently explained. The Authorized Version is, <span class="cmt_word">The great God that formed all things</span> <span class="cmt_word">both rewardeth the fool, and</span> re-<span class="cmt_word">wardeth</span> transgressors; Revised Version, <span class="accented">As an archer</span> (<a href="../../par/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>) <span class="accented">that woundeth all</span>, <span class="accented">so is he that hireth the fool and he that hireth thorn that pass by</span>. At first sight one would hardly suppose that these could be versions of the same passage. To show the diversity that obtained in early times we quote the Greek and Latin versions. Septuagint, "All the flesh of fools is much distressed (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), for their distraction (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is brought to nought;" Vulgate, "Judgment decides causes, and he who imposes silence on a fool appeases wrath." From the various interpretations of which this proverb is capable, it may be surmised that it was originally one of those hard sayings which were intended to exercise the ingenuity of auditors. It has certainly had that effect in modern times. We may at once eliminate the rendering of the Authorized Version, though the sense is good and scriptural, denoting that the great Creator recompenses the good and punishes sinners. So the medieval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ante Dei vultum nihil unquam restat inultum."</span> God is not in the Hebrew, and <span class="accented">rab</span>, "great," is never used absolutely as equivalent to "God." Nor is the word used elsewhere to mean "head workman;" so the Revised Version margin, "a master worker formeth all things," is suspicious. Some translate, "A great man woundeth [equivalent to 'punisheth'] all; he renders their due to fools and to transgressors." One does not see why this should be attributed to the great man; it certainly is not generally true. Rosenmuller, "The mighty man causes terror; so does he who hires the fool and the transgressor;" but it is not clear why the hiring of a fool should occasion terror. The rendering in the Revised Version, or something very similar, has found favour with many modern commentators, though quite unknown to the mere ancient versions. According to this interpretation, the proverb says that a careless, random way of doing business, taking into one's service fools, or entrusting matters of importance to any chance loiterer, is as dangerous as shooting arrows about recklessly without caring whither they flew or whom they wounded. To this view Nowack objects that it is unparalleled to present an archer as a picture of what is unusual and profitless; that it does not explain why "hireth" is twice repeated; that the connection between shooter and the hire of fool and loiterer is net obvious; and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> does not mean "vagabonds" or "passers by." None of these objections are of much importance; and this interpretation still holds its ground. There is also much to be said for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, which is virtually that of Gesenius, Fleischer, Wordsworth, Nutt, and others: A skilful man, a master workman, produces, makes, everything by his own care and superintendence; but he that hires a fool to do his work hires, as it were, any casual vagabond who may know nothing of the business. One objection to this interpretation is that the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, does not elsewhere have the meaning here attributed to it. Considering all the above interpretations unsatisfactory, Hitzig, after Umbreit, followed herein by Delitzsch and Nowack, translates, "Much bringeth forth all," which means that he who possesses much can do anything, or, as St. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>). But the second hemistich comes in rather lamely, "But he who hires a fool is as one who hires a vagabond." Hence Delitzsch reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> for the first <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, and renders, "But the hire and the hirer of the fool pass away," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. what the fool gets as wages is soon squandered, and the person who took him into his service is ruined by his incapacity. In this case the connection of the two clauses would be this: A rich man, in the nature of things, grows richer; but there are exceptions to this rule; for he who employs stupid and incapable people to do his business suffers for it in property, reputation, and probably in person also; and the incompetent person derives no benefit from the connection. It is impossible to give a decided preference to any of these expositions; and the passage must be left as a crux. It is most probable that the Hebrew text is defective. This would account for the great variations in the versions.

The fool never frees himself from the trammels of his foolishness; his deeds and words always bear the same character to the end. The same truth holds good of the sinner, especially the drunkard and the sensualist. If they feel temporary compunction, and reject their sin by partial repentance, they do not really shake it off wholly; it has become a second nature to them, and they soon relapse into it. Septuagint, "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes hateful, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin." The LXX. adds a distich which is found in Ecclus. 4:21, "There is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace."

Nothing so shuts the door against improvement as self-conceit. "Woe unto them," says Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), "that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight." Such persons, professing themselves wise, become fools (<a href="../../par/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>). Touching conceit, <span class="accented">Qui sibi sapit</span>, <span class="accented">summe desipit</span>. The Oriental speaks of the fox finding his shadow very large, and of the wolf when alone thinking himself a lion. <span class="cmt_word">There is more hope of a fool than of him</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-20.htm">Proverbs 29:20</a>). A fool who is conscious of unwisdom may be set right; but one who fancies himself perfect, and needing no improvement, is beyond cure; his case is hopeless. So the sinner who feels and acknowledges his iniquity may be converted; but the self-righteous Pharisee, who considers himself to have no need of repentance, will never be reformed (see Matthew <a href="../../par/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>). St. Chrysostom (Hom. in Phil.,' 7), "Haughtiness is a great evil; it is better to be a fool than haughty; for in the one case the folly is only a perversion of intellect, but in the other ease it is still worse; for it is folly joined with madness. The fool is an evil to himself; but the haughty man is a plague to others too. One cannot be haughty-minded without being a fool...  The soul which is puffed up has a worse disease than dropsy, while that which is under restraint is treed from all evil" (Oxford transl.).

Other analogies have been found in this proverb. Thus: The door opens to let the diligent go forth to his daily business, while the sluggard is rolling upon his bed; the door creaks when it is moved, so the lazy man groans when he is aroused; the door now is opened, now is shut, so the sluggard at one time intends to rise, and then falls back in his bed, and returns to his sleep (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>).

The idle fool sets more value by his own judgment than by the sense of any number of wise men. Revised Version margin, "that can answer discreetly," is perhaps nearer the Hebrew, which implies the being able to return a wise and proper answer to anything asked of them. The LXX. reading a little differently, renders, "Wiser seems a  sluggard to himself than one who in satiety (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>) brings back a message." This is explained to mean that a sluggard thinks himself wise in not helping a neighbour with an errand or a message, though he would have probably been repaid with a good dinner for his kindness.

Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears, and thus needlessly provokes him to bark and bite. Regarding the position of the two participles in this verse, without any connecting link, Delitzsch takes "passing by" as attributed to the dog, thus: "He seizes by the ears a dog passing by, who is excited by a strife that concerns him not." The stray dog corresponds to the quarrel with which one has nothing to do. The present accentuation does not support this view; otherwise it is suitable and probable. Septuagint, "As he who lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he who sets himself forth as champion in another's cause." Ecclus. 11:9, "Strive not in a matter that concerns thee not."

Figure to yourself the fierceness and cruelty of a sudden excitement of anger, or the bursting forth of passion which, like a flood, carries all before it; these may be violent for a time, yet they will subside when they have spent themselves. <span class="cmt_word">But who is able to stand before envy?</span> or rather, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>. The reference is not so much to the general feeling of envy as to the outraged love in the relation of husband and wife (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-34.htm">Proverbs 6:34</a>, and note there). <a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>, "Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very vehement flame." Such jealousy does not blaze forth in some sudden outbreak, and then die away; it lives and broods and feeds itself hourly with fresh aliment, and is ready to act at any moment, hesitating at no means to gratify itself, and sacrificing without mercy its victim. Septuagint, "Pitiless is wrath, and sharp is anger; but jealousy (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) submits to nothing." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a></div><div class="verse">Open rebuke <i>is</i> better than secret love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Open rebuke is better than secret love.</span> Love that is hidden and never discloses itself in acts of self-denial or generosity, especially that which from fear of offending does not rebuke a friend, nor speak the truth in love (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>), when there is good reason for such openness - such disguised love is worse, more objectionable, less beneficial, than the plain speaking which bravely censures a fault, and dares to correct what is wrong by well-timed blame. To hold back blame, it has been said, is to hold back love. "I love not my friend," wrote Seneca ('Ep.,' 25), "if I do not offend him." Plautus, 'Trinum.,' 1:2, 57 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Sed tu ex amicis certis mi es certissimus.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">Si quid scis me fecisse inscite aut improbe,<br />Si id non me accusas, tu ipse objurgandus."</span> Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 16, "Amici vitia si feras, facis tua," which Erasmus expounds by adding, "If you take no notice of your friend's faults, they will be imputed to you." Cicero ('De Amicit.,' 24, 25) has some sensible remarks on this subject: "When a man's ears are shut against the truth, so that he cannot hear the truth from a friend, the welfare of such a one is hopeless. Shrewd is the observation of Cato, that some are better served by bitter enemies than by friends who seem to be agreeable; for the former often speak the truth, the latter never.... As therefore both to give and receive advice is the characteristic of true friendship, and that the one should act with freedom, but not harshly, and that the other should accept remonstrance patiently and without resistance, so it should be considered that there is no deadlier bane to friendship than adulation, fawning, and flattery." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a></div><div class="verse">Faithful <i>are</i> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy <i>are</i> deceitful.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Faithful are the wounds of friend</span>. This and the next verse afford examples of the antithetic form of proverb, where the second line gives, as it were, the reverse side of the picture presented by the first. The wounds which a real friend inflicts by his just rebukes are directed by truth and discriminating affection (see <a href="../../par/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</span> So St. Jerome, <span class="accented">Fraudulenta oscula odientis</span>. But the verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;</span>) has the meaning, among others, "to be abundant or frequent;" hence it is better to take it in this sense here, as "plentiful, profuse." An enemy is lavish with his Judas kisses to hide his perfidy and hatred. Septuagint, "More to be trusted are the wounds of a friend than the spontaneous (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) kisses of an enemy." "Non omnis qui parcia," wrote St. Augustine ('Ep.,' 48, 'ad Vincent.'), "amicus est, neque omnis qui verberat, inimicus." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a></div><div class="verse">The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The full soul loatheth an honeycomb</span>. For "loathes" the Hebrew is literally "treads upon," "tramples underfoot," which is the expression of the greatest disgust and contempt; or it may mean that the well-fed man will not stoop to pick up the comb which may have dropped in his path from some tree or rock. But whichever way we take it, the same truth is told - Self-restraint increases enjoyment; over-iudulgence produces satiety, fatigue, and indolence. Horace, 'Sat.,' 2:2, 38 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Jejunus raro stomachus vulgaria temnit."</span> But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. So the prodigal in the parable would fain fill himself with the husks which the swine did eat. So we say, "Hunger is the best sauce;" the Germans, "Hunger makes raw beans sweet;" and the Portuguese. "Brackish water is sweet in a dry land." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8</a></div><div class="verse">As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <i>is</i> a man that wandereth from his place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a bird that wandereth from her nest.</span> Jerome's <span class="accented">avis transmigrans</span> conveys to us a notion of a migratory bird taking its annual journey. But the idea here is of a bird which leaves its own nest either wantonly or from some external reason, and thereby exposes itself to d so comfort and danger (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So is a man that wandereth from his place</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his own home (comp. Ecclus. 29:21, etc., and 36:28 in Vet. Lat., "Quis credit ei qui non habet nidum, et deflectens  ubicumque obscuraverit, quasi succinctus latro exsil ins de civitate in civitatem?"). The proverb indirectly inculcates love of one's home and one's native land. To be "a fugitive and a vagabond" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>) was a terrible punishment, as the Jews have learned by the experience of many centuries. Language and religion placed a barrier against residence in any country but their own (see <a href="../../par/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a>.); and though at the time when this book was probably written they knew little of foreign travel, yet they regarded sojourn in a strange land as an evil, and centred all their ideas of happiness and comfort in a home life surrounded by friends and countrymen. The word "wander" may have the notion of going into exile. Septuagint, "As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so is a man brought into bondage when he is banished (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>) from his own place." Some have reasoned from this expression that the idea of exile had become familiar to the writer, and hence that this portion of the Proverbs is of very late origin (Cheyne) - surely a very uncertain foundation for such a conclusion. The love of Orientals for their native soil is a passion which no sordid and miserable surroundings can extinguish, and a man would consider even a change of home an unmixed evil, though such change was not the result of exile. Our view of the fortunes of one who is always shitting his abode is expressed in the adage, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a></div><div class="verse">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <i>doth</i> the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart.</span> (For the use of unguents in the honourable treatment of guests, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, etc.; Proverbs 21:17.) Similarly, perfumes prepared from spices, roses, and aromatic plants were employed; rooms were fumigated, persons were sprinkled with rose water, and incense was applied to the face and beard, as we read (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar ordered that to Daniel, in recognition of his wisdom, should be offered an oblation and sweet odours (see 'Dick of Bible,' and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' <span class="accented">voc</span>. "Perfumes"). The heat of the climate, the insalubrious character of the houses, the profuse perspiration of the assembled guests, rendered this attention peculiarly acceptable (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>). The LXX., probably with a tacit reference to <a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, renders, "The heart delighteth in ointments, and wines, and perfumes." <span class="cmt_word">So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</span> This is rather clumsy; the Revised Version improves it by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">that cometh from hearty counsel</span>. The meaning is that as ointment, etc., gladden the heart, so do the sweet and loving words of one who speaks from the depths of his soul. The idea is primarily of a friend who gives wise counsel, speaking the truth in love, or shows his approval by discreet commendation. The LXX. has pointed differently, and translates, "But the soul is broken by calamities (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "The soul is sweetened by the good counsels of a friend."

It seems to be a combination of two maxims. <span class="cmt_word">Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</span> A father's friend is one who is connected with a family by hereditary and ancestral bonds; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Septuagint. Such a one is to be cherished and regarded with the utmost affection. <span class="cmt_word">Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity.</span> The tried friend is more likely to help and sympathize with you than even your own brother, for a friend is born for adversity, and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, where see notes). The mere blood relationship, which is the result of circumstances over which one has had no control, is inferior to the affectionate connection which arises from moral considerations and is the effect of deliberate choice. We must remember, too, that the practice of polygamy, with the separate establishments of the various wives, greatly weakened the tie of brotherhood. There was little love between David's sons; and Jonathan was far dearer to David himself than any of his numerous brothers were. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. "Near" and "far off" may be taken as referring to feeling or to local position. In the former case the maxim says that a neighbour who is really attached to one by the bonds of affection is better than the closest relation who has no love or sympathy. In the latter view, the proverb enunciates the truth that a friend on the spot in time of calamity is more useful than a brother living at a distance (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint); one is sure of help at once from the former, while application to the latter must occasion delay, and may not be successful.

If the pupil did not show wisdom and morality in his conduct, the teacher would incur blame for the apparent failure of his education; whereas the high tone of the disciple might be appealed to as a proof of the merit and efficacy of the tutor's discipline. On the other hand, the evil doings of Hebrews often made the Name of God to be blasphemed among the Gentiles; just as nowadays the inconsistent lives of Christians are the greatest impediment to the success of missionary efforts in heathen countries.

He might as well try to hide the ointment which signifies its presence by its odour. But there is no "which" in the original, which runs literally, "his right hand calls oil," or, "oil meets his right hand." The former is supposed to mean that he is hurt in the struggle to coerce the vixen, and needs ointment to heal his wound; but the latter seems the correct rendering, and the meaning then is that, if he tries to hold or stop his wife, she escapes him like the oil which you try in vain to keep in your hand. An old adage says that there are three things which cannot be hidden, but always betray themselves, viz. a woman, the wind, and ointment.

Some have taken the proverb in a bad sense, as if it meant that one angry word leads to another, one man's passion excites another's rage. Thus Aben Ezra.

Horace uses the same figure of speech, 'Ars Poet.,' 304 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Fungar vice cotis, acutum<br />Reddere quae ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secaudi."</span> On the subject of mutual intercourse Euripides says, 'Androm.,' 683 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Companionship<br />Is that which teaches mortals everything."</span>

The abundance of the produce of this tree makes it a good figure of the reward of faithful service. Septuagint, "He that planteth a fig tree shall eat the fruits thereof" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-6.htm">2 Timothy 2:6</a>). So he that waiteth on his maser shall be honoured. He who pays attention, has loving regard to his master, shall meet with honour as his reward at his master's hands, and also from all who become acquainted with his merits. The gnome may well be applied to the case of those who do true and laudable service to their heavenly Master, and she shall one day hear from his lips the gracious word, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-19.htm">Proverbs 27:19</a></div><div class="verse">As in water face <i>answereth</i> to face, so the heart of man to man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo in aquis resplendent vultus prospicientium</span>, <span class="accented">sic corda hominum manifesta sunt prudentibus</span>. As in clear water the face of the gazer is reflected, so man finds in his fellow man the same feelings, sentiments, passions, which he has himself. He sees in others the likeness of himself; whatever he knows himself to be, he will see others presenting the same character. Self-knowledge, too, leads to insight into others' minds; "for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>). There is a solidarity in human nature which enables us to judge of others by ourselves. The difficulties in the construction and wording of the sentence do not affect the interpretation. They are, however, best met by rendering, with Delitzsch, "As it is with water, face corresponds to face, so also the heart of man to man." Septuagint, "As faces are not like faces, so neither are the thoughts of men;" which is like the saying of Persius, 'Sat.,' 5:52 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Mille hominum species, et rerum discolor usus;<br />Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a></div><div class="verse">Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell and destruction are never full.</span> "Hell" is sheol, the under-world, Hades, the place of the departed; "destruction" is the great depth, the second death, personified (see on Proverbs 15:11, where the terms also occur). These "are never satisfied," they are insatiable, all-devouring (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So the eyes of man are never satisfied.</span> The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The eye is taken as the representative of concupiscence in general. What is true of "the lust of the eyes" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>) is true of all the senses; the craving for their gratification grows as it is fed. Therefore the senses should be carefully guarded, lest they lead to excess and transgression. "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity," said the psalmist, "and quicken me in thy way" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>). The LXX. here introduces a paragraph not in the Hebrew or the Latin Versions: "He that fixes (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) his eye [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. staring impudently] is an abomination to the Lord, and the uninstructed restrain not their tongue." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <i>is</i> a man to his praise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fining pot</span>, etc. (see on Proverbs 17:3; comp. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>). So is a man to his praise. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">The crucible for silver</span>, <span class="accented">and the furnace for gold</span>, <span class="accented">and a man according</span>, <span class="accented">to his praise; i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as the processes of metallurgy test the precious metals, so a man's public reputation shows what he is really worth, as is stated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>. As the crucible brings all impurities to the surface, so public opinion drags forth all that is bad in a man, and he who stands this test is generally esteemed. Certainly praise is a stimulus to exertion, an incentive to try to make one's self worthy of the estimation in which one is held, especially if he purifies it from the dross and earthliness mixed with it, and takes to himself only what is genuine and just. But public opinion is very commonly false end is always a very unsafe criterion  of moral excellence. Hence other interpretations have been proposed. Ewald renders, "and a man according to his boasting," that is, according to that which he most praises in himself and others. So virtually Hitzig, Bottcher, Zockler, and others. In this view the gnome denotes that a man's real character is best examined by the light cast upon it by his usual line of thought, what he most prides himself upon, what he admires most in other men. Plumptre, after Gesenius and Fleischer, has, "So let a man be to his praise," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the mouth which praises him; let him test this commendation, to see what it is worth, before he accepts it as his due. The explanation first given seems on the whole most suitable, when we reflect that the highest morality is not always enunciated, and that secondary motives are widely recognized as factors in action and judgment. There are not wanting men in modern days who uphold the maxim, <span class="accented">Vox populi</span>, <span class="accented">vox Dei</span>. Septuagint, "The action of fire is a test for silver and gold, so a man is tested by the mouth of them that praise him." No surer test of a man's true character can be found than his behaviour under praise; many men arc spoiled by it. If a man comes forth from it without injury, not rendered vain, or blind to his defects, or disdainful of others, his disposition is good, and the commendation lavished upon him may be morally and spiritually beneficial. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sic probatur homo ore laudantis</span>, "So is a man proved by the mouth of him that praises him." The following passage from St. Gregory, commenting on this, is worth quoting, "Praise of one's self tortures the just, but elates the wicked. But while it tortures, it purifies the just; and while it pleases the wicked, it proves them to be reprobate. For these revel in their own praise, because they seek not the glory of their Maker. But they who seek the glory of their Maker are tortured with their own praise, lest that which is spoken of without should not exist within them; lest, if that which is said really exists, it should be made void in the sight of God by these very honours; lest the praise of men should soften the firmness of their heart, and should lay it low in self-satisfaction; and lest that which ought to aid them to increase their exertions, should be even now the recompense of their labour. But when they see that their own praises tend to the glory of God, they even long for and welcome them. For it is written, "That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" ('Moral.,' 26:62, Oxford transl.). The LXX. adds a verse which is not found in the Hebrew, but occurs in some manuscripts of the Latin Version, "The heart of the transgressor seeketh out evils, but an upright heart seeketh knowledge." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a></div><div class="verse">Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <i>yet</i> will not his foolishness depart from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle.</span> "To bray" is to pound or beat small.

Of course, the process of separating the husks from the corn by the use of pestle and mortar is much more delicate and careful than threshing in the usual clumsy way; hence is expressed the idea that the most elaborate pains are wasted on the incorrigible fool (see on Proverbs 1:20). His foolishness will not depart from him. An obstinate, self-willed, unprincipled man cannot be reformed by any means; his folly has become a second nature, and is not to be eliminated by any teaching, discipline, or severity. There is, too, a judicial blindness, when, after repeated warnings wilfully rejected and scorned, the sinner is left to himself, given over to a reprobate mind "Whoso teacheth a fool," Siracides pronounces, "is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep" (Ecclus. 22:7). Again, "The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth" (Ecclus. 21:14). In Turkey, we are told, great criminals were beaten to pieces in huge mortars of iron, in which they usually pounded rice. "You cannot straighten a dog's tail, try as you may," says a Telugu maxim (Lane). There is a saying of Schiller's which is quite proverbial, "Heaven and earth fight in vain against a dunce."

He hath that within which drives him on, an accuser in his own conscience, and this he carries about everywhere; and just as it would be impossible to flee from himself, so neither can he escape the persecutor within, but wherever he goeth he is scourged, and hath an incurable wound" ('Hom. in Stat.,' 8:3, Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous are hold as a lion.</span> They are undismayed in the presence of danger, because their conscience is at rest, they know that God is on their side, and, whatever happens, they are safe in the everlasting arms (see <a href="../../par/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>.).

Whence the fearlessness of a righteous man is rightly compared to a lion, because, when he beholds any rising against him, he returns to the confidence of his mind, and knows that he overcomes all his adversaries because he loves him alone whom he cannot in any way lose against his will. For whoever seeks after outward things, which are taken from him even against his will, subjects himself of his own accord to outward fear. But unbroken virtue is the contempt of earthly desire, because the mind is both placed on high when it is raised above the meanest objects by the judgment of its hopes, and is the less affected by all adversities, the more safely it is fortified by being placed on things above" (Oxford transl.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">For the transgression of a land many <i>are</i> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <i>and</i> knowledge the state <i>thereof</i> shall be prolonged.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof.</span> This implies that the wickedness of a nation is punished by frequent changes of rulers, who impose new laws, taxes, and other burdens, which greatly oppress the people; but regarding the antithesis in the second hemistich, we take the meaning to be that when iniquity, injustice, apostasy, and other evils abound, a country becomes the prey of pretenders and partisans striving for the supremacy. The history of the northern kingdom of Israel, especially in the disastrous period succeeding the death of Jeroboam II, affords proof of the truth of the statement (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>). Septuagint, "Owing to the sins of ungodly men, quarrels (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, lawsuits) arise." <span class="cmt_word">But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged</span>. "The state" is the stability, the settled condition of the country. The word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>), here a substantive, equivalent to "station," "base." Umbreit, Nowack, and others translate it, "justice," "authority," "order." When a wise and religious man is at the helm of state, justice continues, lives, and works; such a man introduces an clement of enduring good into a land (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-22.htm">Proverbs 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15</a>). The good kings Ass, Jehoshaphat, Uzziah, and Hezekiah had long and prosperous reigns. Septuagint, "But a clever man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) will quench them (quarrels)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3</a></div><div class="verse">A poor man that oppresseth the poor <i>is like</i> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A poor man that oppresseth the poor.</span> The words rendered "poor" are different. The former is rash, "needy," the latter <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on Proverbs 10:15). Delitzsch notes that, in accordance with the accents in the Masoretic text, we should translate, "A poor man and an oppressor of the lowly - a sweeping rain without bringing bread," which would mean that a tyrant who oppresses the lowly bears the same relation to the poor that a devastating rain does to those whom it deprives of their food. But it is pretty certain that "the poor" and "the oppressor" designate the same person (though the vocalization is against it); hence the gnome refers to a usurper who, rising to power from poor estate, makes the very worst and most tyrannical ruler. Such a one has learned nothing from his former condition but callous indifference, and now seeks to exercise on others that power which once galled him. Thus among schoolboys it is found that the greatest bully is one who has himself been bullied; and needy revolutionists make the most rapacious and iniquitous demagogues. Of such tyrants the prophets complain (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). Wordsworth refers, as an illustration, to Catiline and his fellow conspirators, who were moved by selfish interests to overthrow the commonwealth.  Many modern commentators (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Nowack), in view of the present text, regarding the combination <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and noting that elsewhere the oppressor and the poor are always introduced in opposition (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-13.htm">Proverbs 29:13</a>), read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, or consider <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> as equivalent to it - <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "the head," in the signification of "master," "ruler." The gnome thus becomes concinnous, the ruler who ought to benefit his dependents, but injures them, corresponding to the rain which, instead of fertilizing, devastates the crops. The LXX. had a different reading, as it readers, "A bold man in his impieties (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) calumniates the poor." <span class="cmt_word">Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">bread</span>.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Similis est imbri vehementi</span>, <span class="accented">in quo paratur fames</span>. Ewald supposes that such proverbs as these and the following belong to the time of Jeroboam II, when the prosperity of the people induced luxury and arrogance, and was accompanied with much moral evil, oppression, and perversion of justice ('Hist. of Israel,' 3:126, Eng. transl.). The Bengalee compares the relation of the rich oppressor to the poor, not with the rainstorm, but with that of the carving knife to the pumpkin.

"A double-minded man," says St James (<a href="../../par/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>), "is unstable in all his ways."

Such a man's prayer, if he does pray, is not hearty and sincere, and therefore, lacks the element which alone can make it acceptable. He will not resolve to forsake his favourite sin, even while paying outward worship to the God whoso Law he breaks: what wonder that the prophet so sternly denounces such offenders (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. etc.), and the psalmist cries with terrible rigour, "When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin" (<a href="../../par/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>)? St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 10:27), "Our heart blames us in offering up our prayers, when it calls to mind that it is set in opposition to the precepts of him whom it implores, and the prayer becomes abomination, when there is a 'turning away' from the control of the Law; in that wrily it is meet that a man should be a stranger to the favours of him to whose bidding he will not be subject." And again (ibid., 18:9, 10), "If that which he bids we do, that which we ask we shall obtain.

Taking the proverb in a moral sense, we find this truth: If the good man does ever yield to the temptations of the sinner, the latter does not reap the enjoyment which he expected from the other's lapse, rather he is made twofold more the child of hell, he himself sinks the deeper and more hopelessly for playing the devil's pert, while the just rises from hi. temporary fall morn humble, watchful, and guarded for the future. <span class="cmt_word">But the upright shall have good things in possession;</span> or, <span class="accented">shall inherit good</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). He shall be abundantly rewarded by God's grace and protection, by the comfort of a conscience at rest, and by prosperity in his worldly concerns - an adumbration of the eternal recompense awaiting him in the life to come. St. Jerome has changed the incidence of the gnome by inserting <span class="accented">ejus</span>, thus: <span class="accented">Et simplices possidebunt bona ejus</span>, which makes the meaning to be that the righteous shall be the instruments of retribution on the deceiver, whose riches shall pass over into their possession.

Septuagint, "The transgressors shall pass by good things, and shall not enter into them," where the translator has misunderstood the original.

"Rejoice," rather <span class="accented">triumph</span>, as conquerors, right prevailing and wickedness being overcome.

If we take this verse in connection with ver. 2, we may see in it the triumph of order after a period of confusion and anarchy. Septuagint, "Through the help of righteous men great glory arises." But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden (comp. ver. 28, where, however, the verb is different). The Authorized Version m, one that when the wicked rise to power, people have to hide themselves in order to escape danger to life and property. The verb is more literally rendered, "are searched for," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they have betaken themselves to hiding places, and have to be looked for; they fear oppression and injury, and venture no  longer into the streets and open places.

Other interpretations of the proverb have been suggested, though none is so satisfactory as that given above. Thus some take the searching out to mean testing, in the sense that evil times try men's characters, and bring out their true nature (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>).

A man hardens his heart who attends not to the voice of conscience, the restraints of religion, the counsel of friends, the warnings of experience (comp. ver. 26; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>).

To such a powerful tyrant is as fatal as a roaring lion or a hungry bear prowling in quest of food. The prophets compare evil rulers to ravenous lions (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-6.htm">Ezekiel 19:6</a>). They are like lions in strength and cruelty, like bears in craft and ferocity. Septuagint, "A hungry lion and a thirsty wolf is he, who, being poor, rules over an indigent nation." The poverty of the subjects embitters the conduct of the ruler. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">The prince that wanteth understanding <i>is</i> also a great oppressor: <i>but</i> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <i>his</i> days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and rich in oppression</span>. Ewald, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others take the verse, not as a statement, but as a warning addressed to the ruler, as we have so many addressed to a son, and as the author of the Book of Wisdom calls upon the judges of the earth  to listen to his admonitions. They therefore render thus: "O prince, void of understanding, but rich in oppression!" The wording and accentuation of the passage confirm this view. Caher renders, "A prince that wants understanding increases his exactions." The want of intelligence makes a prince cruel and tyrannical and callous to suffering: not possessing the wisdom and prudence necessary for right government, he defrauds his subjects, treats them unjustly, and causes great misery. See the prophet's denunciation of Shallum and Jehoiakim for these very crimes (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>). Septuagint, "A king wanting revenues is a great oppresser (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>). The prince addressed is thus warned that his oppressive acts will be visited upon him judicially; that only a ruler who deals with his subjects liberally and equitably can attain to old age, and that his conduct will shorten his life. An early death is reckoned as a token of God's indignation. The second hemistich Caher translates, "But he who hates lucre shall reign long." Septuagint, "He who hateth iniquity shall live a long time." (For "covetousness" (<span class="accented">betsa</span>), see on Proverbs 1:19.)

The wilful murderer, with his guilt upon his soul, flies in vain from remorse; his crime pursues him even to the grave. For inadvertent manslaughter the cities of refuge offered an asylum, but for deliberate murder there was no safe refuge, either from the stings of conscience or from the avenger of blood, but death. The homicide, like Cain (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), must be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. "Pit" (<span class="accented">bor</span>), some take to mean any hiding place, "a cave, or well;" but it is very commonly found in the sense of sepulchre (<a href="../../par/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>, etc.), and is so explained here by most commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Let no man stay him.</span> We had in <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>, etc., an injunction to save human life; but the case was quite different from this of wilful murder. Here it is directed that no one attempt to save him from the punishment which he has incurred, or to comfort him under the remorse which he suffers. Let him be left alone to meet the fate which he has merited. The LXX. gives a different idea to the gnome, "He who becomes bail for a man charged with murder shall be banished and shall not be in safety." They add a verse which we shall meet again, almost in the same words (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-17.htm">Proverbs 29:17, 18</a>), "Chasten thy son, and he will love thee, and will give honour to thy soul; he shall not obey a sinful nation."

One who is only anxious to become quickly rich, and is unscrupulous as to means, cannot be "a faithful man," and therefore cannot be blessed. Instead of "innocent," many expositors render "unpunished" (as <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>), which better contrasts with the blessings mentioned in the first hemistich, though the two ideas are coordinate. On this haste of covetousness, Juvenal writes ('Sat.,' 14:173) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Inde fere scelerum causae; nec plura venena<br />Miscuit aut ferro grassatur saepius ullum<br />Humanae mentis vitium, quam saeva cupido<br />Immodici census; nam dives qui fieri vult,<br />Et cito vult fieri.

But to bribe a judge with a morsel of bread seems an unlikely idea; and the gnome is of general application, "And for a morsel of bread a man [not 'that man'] will transgress." As some men in responsible positions are often swayed by low and unworthy considerations, so in social life a very insignificant cause is sufficient to warp the judgment of some persons, or draw them aside from the line of rectitude. (For "a piece of bread," as denoting abject poverty or a thing of no value, see on Proverbs 6:26) The commentators cite Aul. Gell., 'Noct. Att.,' 1:15, "Frusto panis conduci potest vel uti taceat vel uti loquatur." Septuagint, "He that regards not the persons of the just is not good; such a cue will sell a man for a morsel of bread."

The man of evil eye (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>) is the envious and covetous man; such a one tries to improve his position and raise himself speedily to the height of him whom he envies, and is quite unscrupulous as to the means which he uses to effect his purpose, and keeps all that he gains selfishly to himself. And yet he is really blind to his own best interests (comp <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4, 5</a>). His grasping greed brings no blessing with it (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>), excites others to defraud him, and in the end consigns him to merited poverty. The LXX. here reads somewhat differently, and translates, "An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knows not that the merciful man (<span class="accented">chasid</span> instead of <span class="accented">cheser</span>) will I,ave the mastery over him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will take his wealth, as ver. 8. Proverbs concerning hastily gotten wealth have already been given.

The suffix cannot be that of the first person singular, which would give no sense; hence most interpreters see in it a peculiar adverb attached to the following verb, "shall afterwards find." Delitzsch. Lowenstein, end Nowack take it for a noun with the termination <span class="accented">-ai</span>, and translate, "a man that goeth backward," "a backslider" (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>).

A faithful counsellor, who tells a man his faults, brings them home to his conscience, and checks him in his downward course, will be seen to be a true friend, and will be loved and respected both by the one whom he has warned and advised and by all who are well disposed. <a href="../../par/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19</a>, "If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him. let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and stroll hide a multitude of sins." "Laudat adulator, sed non est verus amator." The flatterer says only what is agreeable to the man whom he flatters, and thus makes him conceited and selfish and unable to see himself as he really is: the true friend says harsh things, but they are wholesome and tend to spiritual profit, and show more real affection than all the soft words of the fawning parasite.

The expression, "hiding the eyes," occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>, "When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you." The unmerciful man meets with the curses of those whom he has neglected to relieve when he had the power, and such curses are ratified and fulfilled because they are deserved, and Divine retribution attends them (see the opposite view, Ver. 20). "Turn not away thine eye from the needy," says the Son of Sirach, "and give him none occasion to curse thee; for if be curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him" (Ecclus 4:4, etc.; comp.

And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto  the present day.

If a man listens to such flattering words, and is influenced by them, he works his own ruin; self-deceived, he knows not his real condition, and accordingly makes grievous disaster of his life. The LXX. gives a different turn to the sentence, "He that prepareth a net before his friend entangles his own feet therein" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>).

The snare is that the sinner is caught and held fast by his sin, and cannot escape, as he knows nothing of repentance, and has no will to cast off evil habits (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). (For "snare," comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-25.htm">Proverbs 22:25</a>.) Septuagint, "For a man sinning there lies a great snare." <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious. It may mean that the good man has a conscience at peace, is free from the snare of sin, and therefore is glad; or that, in spite of a momentary fall, though he has transgressed, he knows that God forgives him on his repentance, and this makes him happy; or, generally that he rejoices in the happy life which his virtue procures for him here and hereafter (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). In the original "sing" represents the sudden outburst of joy, "rejoice" the continued state of happiness.

Septuagint, "A righteous man knows how to judge for the poor." <span class="cmt_word">The wicked regardeth not to know it.</span> This is a clumsy translation; it means, pays no attention so as to become fully acquainted with its details and bearings. But the words signify rather, as in the Revised Version margin, "understandeth not knowledge" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>), has no knowledge which would lead him to enter into the poor man's case, and to sympathize with him in his distress; the claims of the feeble to recognition and relief at his hands are utterly unknown and disregarded. He can daily look on Lazarus at his gate, and find no call for his pity and charity; he can see the wounded traveller in the road, and pass by on the other side. The LXX. offers two translations of the latter clause, reading the second time <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;</span>, and thereby not improving the sense: "But the ungodly understand. eth not knowledge, and the poor man hath not an understanding mind." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-8.htm">Proverbs 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Scornful men bring a airy into a snare.</span> "Men of derision" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>) are those who despise and scoff at all things great and high, whether sacred or profane (see on Proverbs 1:22).

The rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, "bring into a snare," as in the Authorized Version, is supported by some of the Jewish versions and  commentaries; but the more correct rendering is "blow into a blaze, inflame," as the Revised Version (comp. <a href="../../par/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20, 21</a>). These scorners excite the populace to acts of fury, when all respect for piety and virtue is lost; they fan the passions of the fickle people, and lead them to civil discord and dangerous excesses (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>).

St. Jerome makes the former the subject, <span class="accented">Vir sapiens</span>, <span class="accented">si cum stulto contenderit</span>, <span class="accented">sive irascatur</span>, <span class="accented">sive rideat</span>, <span class="accented">non inveniet requiem</span>. It matters not how the wise man treats the fool; he may be stern and angry, he may be gentle and good tempered, yet the fool will be none the better, will not be reformed, will not cease from his folly, will carry on his cavilling contention. Hitzig, Delitzsch, and others, deeming that the rage and the laughter are not becoming to the character of the wise man, take the fool as the subject; so that the sense is, that after all has been said, the fool only falls into a passion or laughs at the matter, argument is wasted upon him, and the controversy is never settled. This seems to be the best interpretation, and is somewhat supported by the Septuagint, "A wise man shall judge the nations, but a worthless man, being angry, laughs and fears not [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which may also mean, 'is derided and terrifies no one']." Wordsworth notes that the irreligious fool is won neither by the austere preaching of John the Baptist nor by the mild teaching of Christ, but rejects both (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16-19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-10.htm">Proverbs 29:10</a></div><div class="verse">The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bloodthirsty hate the upright;</span> <span class="accented">him that is perfect</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint. His life is a tacit reproach to men of blood, robbers, murderers, and such like sinners, as is finely expressed in the Book of Wisdom 2:12, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the just seek his soul.</span> The explanation of this hemistich is doubtful. The following interpretations have been offered: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The just seek the soul of the upright to deliver him from death temporal and spiritual (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-6.htm">Proverbs 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The just seek the murderer's life, take vengeance on him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9, 10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "As for the just, they (the murderers) attempt his life," where the change of subject, though by no means unparalleled, is awkward (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>). The second explanation makes the righteous the executioners of vengeance on the delinquents, which does not seem to be the idea intended, and there is no confirmation of it in our book. The interpretation first given has against it the fact that the phrase, "to seek the soul," is used of attempts against the life, not of preserving it. But this is not fatal; and the above seems to be the most likely explanation offered, and gives a good antithesis. Men of blood hate a virtuous man, and try to destroy him; the righteous love him, and do their utmost to defend and keep him safe. If this interpretation is rejected, the third explanation is allowable, the <span class="accented">casus pendens</span> - "the just, they seek his life" - may be compared with <a href="../../par/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Septuagint, "But the upright will seek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) his life."

The wording of the second hemistich confirms this rendering. A fool pours out his wrath, restrained by no consideration. It is a wise maxim that says, "Command your temper, lest it command you;" and again, "When passion enters in at the foregate, wisdom goes out at the postern." So we have the word attributed to Evenus Parius - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wrath often hath revealed man's hidden mind,<br />Than madness more pernicious."</span> A wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. This clause is capable of more than one explanation. The Authorized Version says that the wise man restrains his own anger till he can give it proper vent. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> occurs nowhere else, and is rendered "at last," "finally," and by Delitzsch, "within," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his heart. The verb rendered "keepeth in" (<span class="accented">shabach</span>) is rather "to calm," "to hush," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, "Which stilleth the noise of the seas." So we have the meaning: The wise man calms the auger within him; according to the proverb, <span class="accented">Irae dilatio</span>, <span class="accented">mentis pacatio</span>. Or the anger calmed may be that of the fool: The wise man appeases it after it has been exhibited; he knows how to apply soothing remedies to the angry man, and in the end renders him calm and amenable to reason. This seems the most suitable explanation. Septuagint, "A wise man husbands it (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in part."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a></div><div class="verse">Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <i>is</i> he.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where there is no vision, the people perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">cast off restraint</span>, become ungovernable, cannot be reined in (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22, 25</a>). "Vision" (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), prophecy in its widest sense, denotes the revelation of God's will made through agents, which directed the course of events,  and was intended to be coordinate with the supreme secular authority. The prophets were the instructors of the people in Divine things, standing witnesses of the truth and power of religion, teaching a higher than mere human morality. The fatal effect of the absence of such revelation of God's will is stated to be confusion, disorder, and rebellion; the people, uncontrolled, fall into grievous excesses, which nothing but high principles can restrain. We note the licence of Eli's time, when there was no open vision (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.); in Asa's days, when Israel had long been without a teaching priest (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>); and when the impious Ahaz "made Judah naked" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>); or when the people were destroyed by reason of lack of knowledge of Divine things (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Thus the importance of prophecy in regulating the life and religion of the people is fully acknowledged by the writer, in whose time, doubtless, the prophetical office was in full exercise: but this seems to be the only passage in the book where such teaching is directly mentioned; the instructors and preceptors elsewhere introduced as disseminating the principles of the <span class="accented">chochmah</span> being parents, or tutors, or professors, not inspired prophets. <span class="cmt_word">But he that keepeth the Law, happy is he!</span> "The Law" (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is not merely the written Mosaic Law, but the announcement of God's will by the mouth of his representatives; and the thought is, not the blessedness of those who in a time of anarchy and irreligion keep to the authorized enactments of the Sinaitic legislation, but a contrast between the lawlessness and ruin of a people uninfluenced by religious guidance, and the happy state of those who obey alike the voice of God, whether conveyed in written statutes or by the teaching of living prophets. (For "happy is he," comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>.)

The next clause gives an explanation of this necessity. <span class="cmt_word">For though he understand he will not answer.</span> The answer is not merely the verbal response to a command, as, "I go, sir;" but it implies obedience in action.

"Every one that speaks," says St. Gregory, "while he waits for his hearer's sentence upon his words, is as it were subjected to the judgment of him by whom he is heard. Accordingly, he that fears to be condemned in respect of his words ought first to put to the test that which he delivers - that there may be a kind of impartial and sober umpire sitting between the hear and tongue, weighing with exactness whether the heart presents right words, which the tongue taking up with advantage may bring forward for the heater's judgment" ('Moral.,' 8:5, Oxford transl.).

It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt  the Jewish interpretation of "progeny:" "he will be as a son." The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). "Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord.

When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another.

It seems clear that it is no longer Wisdom personified who is the speaker, from the fact that the words, "wisdom and understanding" in ver. 2 are used without the possessive pronoun "my," which would have been undoubtedly inserted if this address had been a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter. Some of the ideas of that address, however, are restated, as the crying and lifting up the voice after Wisdom, and the  conclusion, wherein the respective destinies of the pious and wicked are portrayed. The particle "if" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>) is conditional, and serves to introduce the series of clauses (vers. 1-4) which lay down the conditions upon which the promises depend, and which form the protasis to the double apodosis in vers. 5 and 9. De Wette, Meyer, and Delitzsch regard it as voluntative, as expressing a wish on the part of the teacher, and translate, "Oh that thou wouldst!" and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, "if," is used in this way in <a href="../../par/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; but the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) and Vulgate (<span class="accented">si</span>) make it conditional. It is repeated in an emphatic form in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Receive</span>. The verbs "receive" and "hide" show that the endeavour after Wisdom is to be candid and sincere. "To receive" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) seems to be here used, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "to receive graciously," "to admit the words of Wisdom." It is noticeable that there is a gradation in emphasis in the various terms here used by the teacher. Just as "commandments" is stronger than "words," so "hide" is stronger than "receive." The emphasizing is carried on in the following verses in the same way, and at length culminates in ver. 4, which sums up the ardent spirit in which the search after Wisdom is to be prosecuted in presenting it to us in its strongest form. <span class="cmt_word">Hide</span>. The original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">tsaphan</span>) is here used in a different sense to that in which it occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a> and 18. It here refers, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>; and Proverbs 13:22, to the storing or laying up, as of treasure, in some secret repository, and means "to lay up." The Divine commands of the teacher are to be hidden in safe custody in the memory, in the understanding, in the conscience, and in the heart (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>). The psalmist expresses the same idea in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "Thy words have I <span class="accented">hid</span> in my heart, that I might not sin against thee." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse is dependent on the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">So that thou incline.</span> The literal translation is "to incline;" but the inclination of the ear and the application of the heart follow as a consequence upon the precepting ideas (cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut audiat sapientiam auris tua</span>). The root idea of the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> <span class="accented">kashav</span>) is "to sharpen," viz. the ear as expressed, and so to give diligent attention to the precepts of Wisdom. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> it is rendered "to regard." <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">apply thine heart</span> is to turn the heart with the whole scope of its powers, in the spirit of humility and eagerness, to understanding. As the ear represents the outward vehicle of communication, so the <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">lev</span>) represents the inward, the intellectual faculty, the mind, or it may mean the affections as suggested by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">cor</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Understanding</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">t'vunah</span>) is here interchanged with "wisdom," which must determine its meaning to some extent. The LXX. interpreters take it as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the faculty of comprehension." Like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">vinah</span>) in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, the word describes the faculty of distinguishing or separating: but it does not appear to be here used as representing this "as a faculty of the soul, but as a Divine <span class="accented">power</span> which communicates itself as the gift of God" (Delitzsch). A second and perhaps simpler sense may be given to the sentence. It may mean the turning or applying of the heart in an affectionate and loving way, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full purpose, to the discrimination of what is right and what wrong. The ideas of wisdom and understanding seem to some extent to be brought forward as personifications. They are things outside of ourselves, to which we have to give attention. Religion appeals not only to the affections, but also to the intellect, as this satisfies all the yearnings of our nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge.</span> The endeavour after Wisdom is not only to be sincere, it is also to be earnest, as appears from the "yea, if," and the verbs "crying" and "lifting up the voice," both of which frequently occur in Scripture as indicating earnestness. This earnestness is the counterpart of that which Wisdom herself displays (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20, 21</a>). <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> insight. In the original there is practically little difference between "knowledge" and "understanding" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). They carry on the idea expressed in "understanding" in the preceding verse, and thus throw the emphasis on the verbs. The LXX. and Vulgate, however, take "knowledge" as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">sapientia</span>, "wisdom." The reading of the Targum, "If thou tallest understanding thy mother," arises from reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, but is not to be preferred to the Masoretic text, as it destroys the parallelism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou seekest,</span> etc. The climax in the series of conditions is reached in this verse; and the imagery employed in both clauses indicates that the search after Wisdom is to be <span class="accented">persevering</span>, unrelaxing, and diligent, like the unremitting toil and labour with which men carry on mining operations. "To seek" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">bakash</span>) in the original is properly "to seek diligently" (piel), and is kindred to "to search" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphas</span>), which again is equivalent to "to dig" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphar</span>), the Vulgate <span class="accented">effodere</span>, "to dig out." Compare the expression in <a href="../../par/job/3-21.htm">Job 3:21</a>, "And dig for it more than for hid treasures." We trace in these verbs the idea in the mind of the teacher indicated above, which finds expression also in the object of the search, the silver, in its crude state, and the hidden  treasures (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">mat'monim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the treasures of gold, silver, and precious metal concealed in the earth. The comparison here made between the search for Wisdom and the search for the hidden treasures of the earth was not unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind, as it is found worked out with great beauty of detail in the twenty-eighth chapter of Job. Again, the comparison of Wisdom with things most precious in the estimation of man is natural and common, and occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-72.htm">Psalm 119:72</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>. The same ideas and comparisons here used are presented to us in the New Testament teaching, in our Lord's parable of the man who finds the hid treasure in the field, and, in the phraseology of St. Paul, who speaks of "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," and of "the unsearchable riches of Christ." "Divine knowledge is an inexhaustible mine of precious ore" (Wardlaw). The language of the Proverbs would receive additional three from the circumstances of the reign of Solomon, the most splendid and prosperous era in the annals of the Jewish national history, in the means taken to secure the treasures of other and distant countries; the wealth and the riches of that reign (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>) would help to bring out the idea of the superlative value of Wisdom. In no era of the Jewish national history was there such abundance of riches, such splendid prosperity, as in the reign of Solomon, whose ships of Tarshish brought "gold and silver" (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>), and this state of things would give point to the comparisons which the teacher uses in our text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord.</span> <span class="accented">Then</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>), introducing the first apodosis, and answering to the conditional "if" of vers. 1, 3, 4. The earnest endeavour after Wisdom meets with its reward, and those that seek shall find (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>): and thus an inducement is held forth to listen to the admonition of the teacher. <span class="accented">Understand</span> implies the power of discernment, but Zockler gives it the further moaning of taking to one's self as a spiritual possession, just as "find" meaning primarily "to arrive at" conveys the idea of getting possession of (Mercerus). <span class="accented">The fear of the Lord</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">yir'ath y'hovah</span>); "the fear of Jehovah," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>. As it is the beginning, so it is the highest form of knowledge and the greatest good. Elsewhere it is represented as a fountain of life (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>). All true wisdom is summed up in "the fear of the Lord." It here means the reverence due to him, and so comprises the whole range of the religious affections and feelings, which respond to various attributes of the Divine character as they are revealed, and which find their expression in holy worship. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge of God</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">daath Elohim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the knowledge of Elohim.</span> Not merely cognition, but knowledge in its wider sense. The two ideas of "the fear of the Lord" and "the knowledge of God" act reciprocally on each other. Just as without reverence of God there can be no knowledge of him in its true sense, so the knowledge of God will increase and deepen the feeling of reverence. But it is noticeable that the teacher here, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where, however, it is "the knowledge of the holy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">daath k'doshim</span>), gives the chief place to reverence, and thus indicates that it is the basis of knowledge, which is its fruit and result. The relation here suggested is analogous to that which subsists between faith and knowledge, and recalls the celebrated dictum of Anselm: "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam; sed credo, ut intelligam." <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, here interchanged with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, is not of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, as it is only found therein five times, while the predominating word which is used to designate the Deity is <span class="accented">Jehovah.</span> But it is difficult to draw any distinction between them here. <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> may refer more especially to the Personality of the Divine nature, while <span class="accented">Elohim</span> may refer to Christ's glory (Plumptre). Bishop Wordsworth thinks that a distinction is made between the knowledge of Elohim and the knowledge of man which is of little worth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord giveth wisdom.</span> The Lord Jehovah is the only and true Source of wisdom. The truth stated here is also met with in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, "He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding." He "giveth," or more properly, "will give" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">yitten</span>, future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">nathan</span>), wisdom; but the connection requires us to understand that the assurance applies only to those who seek after it earnestly and truly (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-7</a>). The two coefficients to our obtaining wisdom are our efforts and God's assistance. Solomon may be adduced as s striking exemplification of this; he asked for "an understanding heart," and God graciously granted his request (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">mippiv</span>); <span class="accented">ex ore ejus</span>; God is here spoken of anthropologically. He is the true Teacher. The meaning is that God communicates wisdom through the medium of his Word (Delitzsch. Pi.). The law proceeds from his mouth (<a href="../../par/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a>). In the Book of Wisdom (7:25), "Wisdom is the breath of the power of God." His word is conveyed to us through men divinely inspired, and hence St. Peter (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>) says that "holy men of old  spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

The teacher passes to another phase of the Divine character. God is not only the Source of wisdom; he is also the Ensurer of safety, the Source of salvation to those who act uprightly. It will be noted that the use of the word is confined to the Proverbs and Job, with the exception of the two passages in Isaiah and Micah. <span class="cmt_word">Buckler</span>. Besides storing up the treasures of sound wisdom, which the righteous may use and so obtain security in their uprightness, God is himself a <span class="accented">Buckler</span>, or <span class="accented">Shield</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">magen</span>), to those who walk in innocence. This aspect of God's directly protecting power is met with in other parts of Scripture. In <a href="../../par/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a> he encourages Abram with the assurance, "I am thy Shield." In <a href="../../par/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>, Jehovah is called a Shield to his saints. He renders them security against the assaults of their enemies, and especially against the fiery darts of the wicked one. Again, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>, it is said, "God is a Shield (<span class="accented">magen</span>) up to them that walk uprightly." It is incorrect to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">magen</span>) either as an accusative after the verb or in apposition with "sound wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">To them that walk uprightly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to the walkers in innocence</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">l'khol'key thom</span>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">thom</span>) is "integrity of mind," "moral faultlessness," "innocence." "To walk uprightly" is to maintain a course of life regulated by right principles, and directed to right ends. He "walks uprightly who lives with the fear of God as his principle, the Word of God as his rule, and the glory of God as his end" (Wardlaw). The <span class="accented">completeness</span> of the moral and religious character is involved in the expression which is found also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>. The Vulgate translates the latter clause of the verse, <span class="accented">proteget gradientes simpliciter</span>, "he will protect those who walk in simplicity;" cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a> in illustration of the phrase. <span class="cmt_word">He layeth up;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he treasures up (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), or preserves and protects (<span class="accented">custodire</span>, Vulgate), as a person does "treasure or jewel, that it may not be stolen" (Zockler). The majority of commentators read the Keri (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>, "he will treasure up," future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) in preference to the Khetib (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, perfect of same verb, with prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;</span>, "and he treasured up"), and this is the; reading adopted in the Authorized Version. The Keri implies that God does treasure up sound wisdom, while the Khetib, as Delitzsch observes, has the force of the aorist, and so represents the treasuring up as an accomplished fact. The same verb occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>, where it is translated in the Authorized Version by "hide," and also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a> and Proverbs 10:14 by "lay up." The laying up, or treasuring, points to the preciousness of that which is treasured, "sound wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">Sound wisdom</span>. A great variety of opinions exists as to the true meaning of the word in the original, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tvushiyyah</span>), of which "sound wisdom" is an interpretation. Zockler explains it as "wisdom, reflection;" Delitzsch, as "advancement and promotion;" Dathe, as "solid fortune;" Gesenius, as "aid." The proper meaning of the word seems to he "substance," from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be, to exist, to be firm." Professor Lee remarks on the word, "From the places in which it occurs, either wealth, thought, or some such sense it manifestly requires. It occurs in <a href="../../par/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a>, in parallelism with 'help;' in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>, with a 'shield;' in <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, with 'wisdom;' in <a href="../../par/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>, with 'strength;' in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>, with 'discretion;' in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>, with 'counsel' and 'understanding;' in <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>, with 'counsel;' and so in <a href="../../par/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>. In <a href="../../par/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a> and <a href="../../par/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>, 'entirely' or the like seems to suit the context; see also <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>, and generally 'excess,' or 'abundance,' taken either in a good or bad sense, and varied by other considerations, seems to prevail in every case in which this word is used" (see Professor Lee, on <a href="../../par/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>). The parallelism of the passage before us seems to require that it should be understood in the sense of <span class="accented">security</span>; and transferring the idea to wisdom as the means of security. This idea is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">salus</span>, and the Targum <span class="accented">incolumitas.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-8.htm">Proverbs 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He keepeth the paths of judgment.</span> This verse is explanatory of the latter hemistich of ver. 7, and points out more fully in what way God is a Protector of his saints. Some connect the Hebrew infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">lin'tsor</span>), "to watch or keep," with "them that walk uprightly," and translate, "them that walk uprightly by keeping the paths of judgment;" but this is to transfer the idea of protection from God to such persons. The verb signifies specially "to defend, to preserve from danger," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>, "The eyes of the Lind preserve knowledge; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> defend or protect it from danger." It is God who "keepeth the paths of judgment," as he alone has the power to do so. He watches over all that walk therein, guides, superin. tends, and protects them. <span class="accented">The paths of judgment</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">justice</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">at'khoth mishpat</span>). The abstract is here used for the concrete, and the phrase means "the paths of the just," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the paths in which the just walk, or "those who walk justly"  (Mercerus). This expression corresponds with "the way of his saints," just as "keep" and "preserve" are synonymous verbs, both meaning "to guard, keep safe, or protect." <span class="cmt_word">He preserveth the way of his saints.</span> God does this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his preventing grace, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, "He suffereth not our feet to slip." Cf. Hannah's song, "He will keep the feet of his saints" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by angelic agency, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, "He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways." The saints are ever under the watchful care and mighty protection of Jehovah. <span class="accented">His saints</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">khasidav</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the pious towards God, the godly, those in whose hearts the principles of sanctity have been implanted, and who cherish earnest inward love to God, and "walk righteously" and "speak uprightly" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). It is remarkable that the word saints only occurs once (in this passage) in the Proverbs. During the period of the Maccabaean Wars, a party or sect, which aimed at ceremonial purity, claimed for themselves the title of <span class="accented">Chasidim</span> or <span class="accented">Asidaeans</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), as expressive of their piety or devotion. They are those whom Moses called "men of holiness," <a href="../../par/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">v'an'shev-kodesh</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-5.htm">Psalm 89:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18, 22, 22, 25</a>.

As the former referred to God, so this appears to refer more especially to man, and thus we have stated the whole benefit, in its twofold aspect, which Wisdom confers on those who diligently seek her. It is not to be affirmed, however, that righteousness and judgment and equity refer exclusively to man; they must represent some aspects of our relationship to God, both from the meaning of the words themselves, and because the law which regulates our dealings and intercourse with man has its seat in the higher law of our relation to God. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness, and judgment, and equity.</span> These three words occur in the same collocation in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>, which see. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, every good path.</span> "Yea" does not occur in the original. The expression is a summarizing of the three previous conceptions, as if the teacher implied that all good paths are embraced by and included in "righteousness, and judgment, and equity;" but the term is also comprehensive in the widest degree. The literal translation is "every path of good" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">cal-ma'gal-tov</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> every course of action of which goodness is the characteristic, or, as the Authorized Version, "every good path," the sense in which it was understood by St. Jerome, <span class="accented">omnem orbitam bonam.</span> The word here used for "path" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">ma'gal</span>), "the way in which the chariot rolls" (Delitzsch), and metaphorically a course of action, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>.

The conditional force is adopted by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">si.</span> In the previous section of this address, the teacher has shown that the search after Wisdom will result in possession.; now he points out, when Wisdom is secured, certain advantageous consequences follow. The transition is easy and natural. The form of construction is very similar to that adopted previously. There is first the hypothesis, if we give this force to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, though much shorter; and secondly the climax, also shorter and branching off into the statement of two special cases. <span class="accented">Entereth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shall enter</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span> <span class="accented">thavo</span>) in the sense of permanent residence in the heart. Wisdom is not only to come in, but to rest there (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>). The expression is illustrated by <a href="../../par/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>. The imagery of the verse is taken from the reception and entertainment of a guest. As we receive a welcome guest, and find pleasure in his company, so is Wisdom to be dear to the heart and soul. <span class="accented">Into thine heart</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="accented">b'libecha</span>). The heart (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>) "concentrates in it. self the personal life of man in all its relations, the conscious and the unconscious, the voluntary and the involuntary, the physical and the spiritual impulses, the emotions and states" (Cremer, 'Bib. Theol. Lex.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). It is that in which the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>),"soul," manifests itself. It is the centre of the life of will and desire, of the emotions, and of the moral life. Rudloff ('Lehre von Menscher,' p. 59, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, apud Zockler) remarks that everywhere in the Scriptures the heart appears to belong more to the life of desire and feeling than to the intellectual activity of the soul. But at the same time, it is to be noted that intelligent conception is attributed to the heart (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>); <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>. The expression seems to be put  here for the moral side of man's nature; and in the Hellenistic sense, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the proper equivalent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> "heart," involves all that stands for <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it includes, besides other things, the intellectual faculty. The word "soul" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>) is here found in combination with "heart." The other passages where they are mentioned together are <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/13-2.htm">Psalm 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>. The soul is primarily the vital principle, but according to the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> of Holy Scripture, it frequently denotes the entire inward nature of man; it is that part which is the object of the work of redemption. The homo of the soul is the heart, as appears from <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>, "The heart knoweth his own bitterness [or, 'the bitterness of his soul,' Hebrew]." While the "heart" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>) is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, the only Greek equivalent to "soul" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>. The two expressions, "heart," and "soul," in the passage before us may be taken as designating both the moral and spiritual sides of man's nature. Wisdom is to be acceptable and pleasant to man in these respects. It may be remarked that an intellectual colouring is given to the word "heart" by the LXX., who render it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as also in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and other passages, evidently from the idea that prominence is given to the reflective faculty. Classically, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> equivalent to "thought," "faculty of thought," "intellect." <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to know</span>, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a> and Proverbs 14:6; here used synonymously with "wisdom." Knowledge, not merely as cognition, but perception; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not merely knowing a thing with respect to its existence and being, but as to its excellence and truth. Equivalent to the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "perception," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">scientia. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is pleasant</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">yin'am</span>); literally, <span class="accented">shall be pleasant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sweet, lovely, beautiful. The same word is used impersonally in Jacob's blessing of Issachar (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>, "And he saw the land that it was pleasant"), and also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-25.htm">Proverbs 24:25</a>, "To those that punish [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the judges] there shall be delight." And this usage has led Dunn to take knowledge as an accusative of reference, and to translate, "There is pleasure to thy soul in respect of knowledge;" but the Authorized Version may be accepted as correct. "Knowledge" is masculine, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a> and Proverbs 14:6, and agrees with the masculine verb "is pleasant." Knowledge will be pleasant from the enjoyment and rest which it yields. The Arabic presents the idea of this enjoyment under a different aspect: "And prudence shall be in thy soul the most beautiful glory."

Perverseness is the wilful misrepresentation of that which is good and true. The utterances are of a distorted and tortuous character. The word, only found in the plural, is abstract in form, and is of frequent, though not of exclusive, occurrence in the Proverbs. It is attributed to the Israelites in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. It is met with again in such expressions as "the mouth of perverseness," Authorized Version "froward mouth" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>); "the tongue of perverseness," "froward tongue," Authorized Version (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>); "the man of perverseness," "froward man," Authorized Version (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>). What is here said of wicked men is attributed to drunkards in <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>, "Thine heart shall utter perverse things." The expression finds its explanation in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13, 14</a>. The spirit which indulges in this perverseness is stubborn, scornful, self-willed, and rebellious, and it is from such a spirit that discretion is a preservative. In <a href="../../par/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> it is said that "the counsel of the froward is carried headlong" (see also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-27.htm">2 Samuel 22:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/101-4.htm">Psalm 101:4</a>).

The strict meaning of the Hebrew word translated "uprightness" is "straightness," and hence it stands opposed to "perverseness" in the previous verse. Uprightness is integrity, rectitude, honest dealing. The LXX. translators represent the forsaking of the paths of uprightness as a consequence resulting from walking in the ways of darkness, "O ye who have left the right ways by departing [<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">abeundo</span>] into the ways of darkness."

They are ways of darkness, because they endeavour to hide themselves from God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>) and from man (<a href="../../par/job/24-15.htm">Job 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/38-13.htm">Job 38:13, 15</a>). In their tendency and end they lead to the blackness of darkness forever. In Scripture darkness is associated with evil, just as light is with uprightness (see <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19, 20</a>). The same association of ideas is discoverable in the dualism of the Persian system, as formulated by Zoroaster - Ormuzd, the good principle, presides over the kingdom of light, while Ahriman, the principle of evil, is the ruler of the kingdom of darkness.

The wicked not only rejoice to do evil themselves, but they exult when they hear of evil in others (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>). Such may be the interpretation, though the latter part, of the verse is capable of a different and more general rendering as signifying exultation in evil generally, whether it appears in themselves or others. The expression rendered in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">in the frowardness of the wicked,</span> is in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> <span class="accented">b'thah'pucoth ra</span>), <span class="accented">in the perverseness of evil</span>, or in evil perverseness, where the combination of the two nouns serves to give force to the main idea, which is that of perverseness.

It is not perverseness in its simple and common form that these men exult in. but in its worst and most vicious form (for a similar construction, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>; and Proverbs 28:5).

Two terms are employed to designate the source of this evil - "the strange woman" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">ishshah zara</span>), and "the stranger" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">nok'riyah</span>) - and both undoubtedly, in the passage before us, mean a meretricious person, one who indulges in illicit intercourse. The former term is invariably employed in this sense in the Proverbs (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>) of the adulteress (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">zarim</span>), and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>.

But the idea of foreign origin implied in the word is more strongly brought out in the next term, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nok'riyah</span>), on which Delitzsch remarks that it scarcely ever divests itself of a strange, foreign origin. This word is used to designate those "strange women" whom Solomon loved in his old age, and who turned his heart aside to worship false gods (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>), "outlandish women," as they are termed in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>; it designates "the strange wives" of <a href="../../par/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-27.htm">Nehemiah 13:27</a>; and is applied to Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="../../par/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>). Again, it has to be further observed that the laws of the Mosaic code against prostitution were of a most stringent nature (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>), and no doubt served to maintain a higher standard of morality among Israelitish women than that observed among the Midianites, Syrians, and other nations. Strong prohibitions were directed against the intermarriage of Israelites with the women of the surrounding nations; but the example set by Solomon would serve to weaken the force of these prohibitions, and would lead to a large influx of women of a different nationality. The conclusion we arrive at is that the class mentioned in the text, though not Israelitish by birth, were yet so by adoption, as the context clearly indicates (ver. 17) the fact of marriage and the acceptance of certain religious observances. Such women, after a temporary restraint, would eventually set all moral and religious obligations at defiance. and would become the source of temptation to others. The allegorical interpretation given to this passage by the LXX. is to be rejected on the ground that the previous section (vers. 12-15) speaks of perverse men. Which <span class="cmt_word">flattereth with her words;</span> literally, <span class="accented">who has made smooth her words</span>, the hiph. perfect being used of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">khalak</span>), "to make smooth," or "flattering." The preterite shows what her habitual practice is, and is used of an action still continuing, and so may be fitly rendered by the present, as in the Authorized Version: "She has acquired the art of enticing by flattering words, and it is her study to employ them;" cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae mollit sermones suos</span>, "who softens her words;" and the Syriac, <span class="accented">quae subvertit verba sua</span>, "who subverts her words," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "uses deceit."

But the context seems to require that it should be taken as designating her <span class="accented">husband.</span> It will then be the correlative of "the wife of thy youth" of <a href="../../par/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The covenant of her God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the marriage covenant, called "the covenant of her God,"  because entered into in his presence. The forsaking of the guide of her youth is essentially bound up with a forgetfulness of the solemn covenant which she had entered into in the presence of God. No specific mention is made in the Pentateuch of any religious ceremony at marriage; yet we may infer, from <a href="../../par/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14, 15</a>, where God is spoken of as "a Witness" between the husband and "the wife of his youth," "the wife of thy covenant," that the marriage contract was solemnized with sacred rites. The Proverbs thus give a high and sacred character to marriage, and so carry on the original idea of the institution which, under the gospel dispensation, developed late the principle of the indissolubility of the marriage tie. It is no objection to this view that the monogamic principle was infringed, and polygamy countenanced. The reason of this latter departure is given in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a> and <a href="../../par/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16</a>. The morality of the Proverbs always represents monogamy as the rule, it deprecates illicit intercourse, and discountenances divorce. It is in entire accordance with the seventh commandment. The woman who commits adultery offends, not only against her husband, but against her God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For her house inclineth unto death;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she sinks down to death together with her house</span> (Bottcher, Delitzsch). The objection to the Authorized Version is that it does not tbllow the construction of the original, the verb "sinks down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shakhah</span>) being feminine, while "house" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">bayith</span>) is invariably masculine. Aben Ezra translates, "She sinks down to death, (which is to be) her house;" but it seems better to regard "her house" as an adjunct of the strange woman. Her house includes all who belong to her. She and they are involved in the same fate. The Authorized Version is evidently influenced by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inclinata est enim ad mortem domus ejus</span>, "For her house is inclined to death." The LXX. gives a different rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For she hath placed her house beside death." So the Arabic. The "for" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">ki</span>) refers back to ver. 16, and indicates how great is the deliverance effected by wisdom. The meaning of the passage is aptly illustrated by <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>, "Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." <span class="cmt_word">And her paths unto the dead.</span> <span class="accented">The dead</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">r'phaim</span>) are properly the quiet, or the feeble. They are the shadowy inhabitants or shades of Hades, the <span class="accented">inferi</span> of the Vulgate, and are here put for Sheol itself. Compare the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of Homer, and the <span class="accented">umbrae</span>, "shades," of Virgil. The word occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-16.htm">Proverbs 21:16</a>; and in <a href="../../par/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>.

All who visit her shall not return again. The Targum reads, "They shall not return in peace." The difficulty which they who give themselves up to the indulgence of lust and passion encounter in extricating themselves makes the statement of the teacher an almost universal truth. Hence St. Chrysostom says, "It is as difficult to bring back a libidinous person to chastity as a dead man to life." This passage led some of the Fathers to declare that the sin of adultery was unpardonable. Fornication was classed by the scholastic divines among the seven deadly sins, and it has this character given to it in the Litany: "From fornication, and all other deadly sin." St. Paul says, "No whoremonger nor unclean person...hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). The sin which they commit who have dealings with the strange woman is deadly and leads on to death, and from death there is no return, nor laying hold of or regaining the paths of life (see <a href="../../par/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9, 10</a>). Compare the words with which Deiphobe, the Cumaean sibyl, addresses AEneas - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Tros Anchysiade, facilis descensus Averno<br />Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,<br />Hoc opus, hic labor est."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Virgil, 'AEneid,' 6:126-129.</span>) O Trojan, son of Anchyses, easy is the path that leads to hell. But to retrace one's steps, and escape to the upper regions, this is a work, this is a task.

The protecting power of wisdom is developed in a positive direction. Negatively, it delivers from the evil man and from the strange woman, but it does more - "it shall keep thee in order that thou mayest walk in a good way," etc. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'maan</span>) is coordinate with "to deliver thee," but it serves to bring the discourse to a conclusion. Umbreit renders it "therefore," thus making what follows an inference from the preceding discourse. So the Syriac, <span class="accented">ambula igitur</span>, "therefore walk." <span class="cmt_word">In the way of good men</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">b'derek tovim</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the way of the good, in an ethical  sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the upright, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in via bona</span>, "in the good way." "The way of good men" is the way of God's commandments, the way of obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) is here used in the sense of "to observe," "to attend to," but in a different sense from <a href="../../par/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>, "I have observed the ways of the violent man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that I might avoid them. To keep the paths of the righteous is to carefully attend to the life of obedience which they follow. The LXX. closely connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, "For if they had walked in good ways, they would have found the paths of righteousness light." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the upright shall dwell in the land.</span> Much the same language is met with in <a href="../../par/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>, "The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever." It is the secure and peaceful dwelling in the land which is intended (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>). To dwell in the land was always put forward as the reward of obedience to God's commandments (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-18.htm">Leviticus 25:18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>), and the phrase conveyed to the Hebrew mind the idea of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all temporal blessings. The love of country was a predominant characteristic of the race. Elster, quoted by Zockler, remarks, "The Israelite was beyond the power of natural feeling, which makes home dear to every one, more closely bound to the ancestral soil by the whole form of the theocracy; torn kern it, he was in the inmost roots of life strained and broken. Especially from psalms belonging to the period of the exile this patriotic feeling is breathed out in the fullest glow and intensity." <span class="accented">The land</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> <span class="accented">arets</span>) was the promised land, the land of Canaan.

The primary meaning of the verb from which it is derived (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">bagad</span>) is "to cover," "to deal treacherously," and hence the word signifies those who act treacherously or perfidiously, the faithless. They are those who perfidiously depart from God, and break away from the covenant with Jehovah. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>). Shall be rooted out (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">yiss'khu</span>). This word is taken by Davidson as the future kal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nasah</span>), "to pluck up," and hence is equivalent to "they shall pluck up," or, passively, "they stroll be plucked up." Delitzsch remarks that it is as at <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, active, "they shall pluck up," and this with the subject remaining indefinite is equivalent to the passive form, "they shall be plucked up." This indefinite "they" can be used of God, as also in <a href="../../par/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a> (Fleischer). The expression has been understood as referring to being driven into exile (Gesenius), and this view would be amply justified by the fate which overtook the apostate nation when both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah suffered this fate (cf. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "they shall be driven out"). It also derives colour from the language of the preceding verse, but the imagery appears to be derived from the cutting down and rooting up of trees. The destruction of the wicked and transgressors will be complete. They shall be exterminated (cf. Targum, <span class="accented">eradicabuntur</span>; Syriac <span class="accented">evellentur</span>; and Arabic, <span class="accented">exterminabuntur</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm"><title>Proverbs 30 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/30.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/30.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/30-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/29.htm" title="Proverbs 29">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 30 <a href="../proverbs/31.htm" title="Proverbs 31">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a></div><div class="verse">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <i>even</i> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-33.</span> - Part VII. FIRST APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Agur." A short introduction, teaching that the Word of God is the source of wisdom (vers. 1-6), is followed by apothegms on different subjects (vers. 7-33). Cornelius a Lapide offers the following opinion concerning this appendix, which no one can hesitate to say is well founded, if he attempts to give it a spiritual interpretation, and to discern mysteries under the literal meaning: "Quarta haec pars elegantissima est et pulcherrima, aeque ac difficillima et obscurissima: priores enim tres partes continent Proverbia et Paraemias claras, ac antithesibus et similitudinibus perspicuas et illustres; haec vero continet aenigmata et gryphos insignes, sed arcanos  et perdifficiles, turn ex phrasi quae involute est et aenigmatica, tum ex sensu et materia, quae sublimis est et profunda." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy.</span> This seems to be the correct rendering of the passage, though it has been made to bear very different interpretations. It is plainly the tide of the treatise which follows Wire Agur and Jakeh were is utterly unknown. The Jewish interpreters considered that "Agur son of Jakeh" was an allegorical designation of Solomon - <span class="accented">Agur</span> meaning "Gatherer," or "Convener" (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>); <span class="accented">Jakeh</span>, "Obedient," or "Pious," which thus would indicate David. St. Jerome somewhat countenances the alle gorical interpretation by translating, <span class="accented">Verba Congregantis</span>, <span class="accented">filii Vomentis</span>, "The words of the Collector, son of the Utterer." But what follows could not apply to Solomon; he could not say, "I have not learned wisdom" (ver. 3), or ask blindly after the Creator (ver. 4). Many have endeavoured to find Agur's nationality in the word that follows, translated "the prophecy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hamassa</span>). <span class="accented">Massa</span> "burden," is usually applied to a solemn prophetical speech or oracle, a Divine utterance (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, etc.), and as this designation was deemed inappropriate to the character of this appendix, it has been thought that allusion is here made to a land of Massa, so called after a son of Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-14.htm">Genesis 25:14</a>), who dwelt in the country of Edom or Seir, and whose inhabitants were among those children of the East whose wisdom had become proverbial (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). Others find Massa in the Hauran, or on the north of the Persian Gulf. The Venetian Version gives, <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. But we have no satisfactory account of a country thus called, and its existence is quite problematical; therefore the ingenious explanations founded on the reality of this <span class="accented">terra ignota</span> need not be specified (see Introduction, pp. 21, etc.). Gratz has suggested that in place of <span class="accented">hamassa</span> should be read <span class="accented">hammoshel</span>, "the proverb writer;" but this is a mere conjecture, unsupported by any ancient authority. If, as seems necessary, we are compelled to resign the rendering, "of Masse," or "the Massan," we must fall back on the Authorized Version, and consider the term "oracle" as applied loosely and abnormally to these utterances of wisdom which follow. That they are not of the nature of Divine communications can be seen at once by consideration of their contents, which are mainly of human, and not of the highest type, and, though capable of spiritual interpretation, do not possess that uniqueness of purpose, that religious character and elevation of subject, which one expects in the enunciations of an inspired prophet. This view does not militate against their claim to be regarded as Holy Scripture; their place in the canon is secured by other considerations, and is not affected by our suspicion of the inappropriateness of the term applied to them; and, indeed, it may be that the very human element in these utterances is meant to be unsatisfying, and to lead one to look for the deep spiritual truths which underlie the secular surroundings. Agur is some poet or moralist, well known in Solomon's time, probably one of the wise men referred to in <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a> (see below). The rest of the paragraph is of greater obscurity than the former portion. <span class="cmt_word">The man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal.</span> According to this rendering, the man is Agur, who is introduced as uttering what follows in ver. 2, etc., to Ithiel and Ucal, two of his sons, pupils, or companions. The name Ucal occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament; Ithiel is found once, in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-7.htm">Nehemiah 11:7</a>, as the name of a Benjamite. Wordsworth regards the names as symbolical of the moral character of those whom the author designs to address, explaining the former as equivalent to "God with me," and the latter as denoting "consumed" with zeal, or "strong," "perfect." It is as if the writer said, "You must have God with you; yea, you must have God with you, if you are to be strong. You must be Ithiels, if you are to be Ucals." He refers to <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>. That the Masorites regarded these words as proper names is evident; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>, indeed, can have no other application. The Syriac takes this view of the words; to the same opinion lean, more or less, the Jewish translators Aquila and Theodotion, Aben Ezra, Vatablus, Pagninus, and others, and it is the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulties which have been seen in the clause. But many modern commentators have declared against it; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Hitzig, Zockler, Detitzsch, Bottcher, Nowack. The repetition of <span class="accented">Ithiel</span> seems unmeaning; one sees no reason why it should be repeated more than <span class="accented">Ucal</span>. The second verse begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, which, as Hebraists agree, cannot stand abruptly at the commencement of a discourse, but rather establishes something that has preceded. But if we take the words in dispute as proper names, no statement to be confirmed has been made. We are, then, constrained to take them in another sense. St. Jerome translates them, writing, <span class="accented">Visio quam locutus est vir</span>, <span class="accented">cum quo est Deus</span>, <span class="accented">et qui Deo secum morante confortatus</span>. The LXX. (which in troduces vers. 1-14 of this chapter after <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>) gives, "Those things saith the man  to those who believe God, and I cease;" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> being the translation of the doubled <span class="accented">Ithiel</span>, equivalent to "God with me," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) being considered to be a formation from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>. Ewald takes the two words to be the name of one man, equivalent to "God with me, so I am strong;" in his own language, <span class="accented">Mitmirgott</span> - <span class="accented">sobinich stark</span>; but his idea of a dialogue between the rich mocker (vers. 2-4) and the humble believer (ver. 5-14) is not well founded, though a late editor, Strack, agreeing, considers that the only possible interpretation of these verses (2-4) is to make the speaker utter them as the outcome of his unbelief and scoffing, to which Agur answers in ver. 5. Under all circumstances, it has seemed to many scholars best to surrender the notion of proper names, and, altering the vocalization, to interpret, "The oracle of the man, 'I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God,'" or, as others say, "about God." The utterance commences here, and not at ver. 2. The repetition forcibly expresses the laborious and painful investigation of the seeker after truth. The final word, vocalized <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, is rendered, "And I have withdrawn;" or, as Bickell, quoted by Cheyne, gives, <span class="accented">v'lo ukal</span>, "I have not prevailed." We arrive thus at this interpretation: first comes the superscription, "The words of Agur," etc., "the oracle of the man;" then begins the utterance, which opens with the melancholy avowal that, though he had longed and striven to know God, his nature, his attributes, his working, he had failed in this object, and expended his labour in vain. Both Agur, and Lemuel who is named in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>, seem to have been persons not of Israelitish nationality, but dwelling in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and acquainted with the religion and sacred literature of the chosen people (see ver. 5). It is by no means unlikely that they were of the race of Ishmael, from which stock many wise men had risen, and where wisdom was so cultivated as to have become proverbial (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>). In what follows Agur shows himself as a philosopher and a critic, but at the same time a firm believer.

Who is he whose universal providence is felt and experienced? Where is this mysterious Being who hides himself from human ken? Christ has said something like this, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" (<a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>); and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>). In biblical language God is said to come down from heaven in order to punish, to aid, to reveal his will, etc. (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, etc.); and he returns to heaven when this intervention is finished (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?</span> Who hath the control of the viewless wind, so as to restrain it or release it at his pleasure?

Septuagint, "Who hath gathered the winds in his bosom (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>)?" <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bound the waters in a garment?</span> The waters are the clouds which cover the vault of heaven, and are held, as it were, in a garment, so that, in spite of the weight which they contain, they fall not upon the earth. As Job says (<a href="../../par/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>), "He bindeth  up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them." And again (<a href="../../par/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), "Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?" So the psalmist, "Thou coveredst it [the earth] with the deep as with a vesture" (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>). (See above, <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Who hath established all the ends of the earth?</span> Who hath consolidated the foundations, and defined the limits, of the remotest regions of the earth? (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>, etc.). The answer to these four questions is "Almighty God." He alone can order and control the forces of nature. <span class="cmt_word">What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</span> or, <span class="accented">if thou knowest</span>. It is not enough to acknowledge the power and operation and providence of this mysterious Being; Agur longs to know more of his nature, his essence. He must have personality; he is not an abstraction, a force, a quality; he is a Person. What, then, is his name, the name which expresses what he is in himself? Men have different appellations for this Supreme Being, according as they regard one or other of his attributes: is there one name that comprehends all, which gives an adequate account of the incomprehensible Creator? The question cannot be answered affirmatively in this life. "We know that if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). The further question, "What is his son's name?" has given some difficulty. The LXX. has, "What is the name of his children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)?" as if there was reference to Israel, the special children of God. But the original does not bear out this interpretation, which is also opposed to the idea of the enigma proposed. The inquiry might mean - Are we to apply to the Supreme Being the same notion of natural relationship with which we are familiar in the human family? But this seems a low and unworthy conception. Or the "son" might be primeval man (<a href="../../par/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>) or the sage; but the answer would not be satisfactory, and would not tend to solve the great question. There are two replies which can be made to Agur's interrogation. Looking to the marvellous description of Wisdom in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc., we may consider Wisdom to be a denotation of the Son of God, and the inquirer desires to know the name and nature of this personage, of whose existence he was certified. Or he may have arrived at a knowledge of the only begotten Son of God, as the idea of the Logos is more or less developed in the Book of Wisdom, in Philo's treatises, and in the Alexandrian school; and longs for more perfect knowledge. This, indeed, is hidden: "He hath name written, which no one knoweth but he himself" (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). It is useless to put such question to a fellow man; no human mind can fathom the nature of the Godhead, or trace out its operations (Ecclus. 18:4, etc.).

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Omnis sermo Dei est ignitus</span>; Septuagint, "All the words of God are tried in the fire (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)."

Titus <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>, "They shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God." In view of the proverbs that follow, the clause seems to be best taken of the blasphemy attending on impatience and want of resignation to God's will (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>).

Ewald and others would render, "Entice not a servant to slander his master;" but there is no need so to take the expression, as the hiph. of the verb is used in post-biblical Hebrew in the sense of "to calumniate." The Septuagint has, "Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master," which seems to refer to the treatment of runaway slaves (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-15.htm">Deuteronomy 23:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty,</span> and have to atone for it.

The sins herein specified had become so general that they affected the whole generation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a generation that eurseth their father.</span> The words, "there is," are not found in the Hebrew, and the four subjects are without a predicate. Delitzsch calls the group "a mutilated priamel," which is explained to be a kind of gnomic poetry containing a series of antecedents or subjects followed by an epigrammatic conclusion applicable to all the antecedents. In the present ease the conclusion is wanting, so that we are left in doubt whether the author meant merely to de. scribe classes of men in his own time or to affirm that such are abominable.

The first sin is that which offends against the commandment to honour and obey parents. This was judged worthy of death under the old Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">And doth not bless their mother.</span> This is a <span class="accented">litotes</span>, "not to bless" being equivalent to "to curse."

The form of the apothegm is climacteric, mounting from two to three, and thence to four, like the famous passage in <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>, though there is no special stress there laid on the last member of the climax; <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.</span> The word "crying" is not in the Hebrew, which says, "The <span class="accented">alukah</span> hath two daughters: Give! Give!" The insatiable appetite of this creature is represented by two words, which are personified as daughters, whom the mother has produced and dearly loves. This word <span class="accented">alukah</span> is not found again in the Old Testament; but in later Hebrew and in Aramaic it means "leech" or "bloodsucker;" and so it is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, and by St. Jerome <span class="accented">sanguisuga</span>. The word is derived from a root which in Arabic means "to adhere." There are several kinds of leeches common in Palestine, and their bloodthirsty nature is well known; as Horace says, 'Ars Poet.,' 476 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris, hirudo."</span> It seems simple and quite satisfactory to accept the word thus, and to see in the voracity of the leech an example of the greed further developed in the following clauses; but commentators have not been contented with this explanation, and have offered various suggestions which are either unnecessary or inadmissible. Thus the Talmud considers <span class="accented">alukah</span> to be an appellation of hell, and the two daughters to be the Power of the world, and Heresy. Some of the Fathers regard it as a symbol of the devil and his dominion; others, as a personification of cupidity with its two offshoots avarice and ambition. Some moderns deem it to mean a vampire or blood thirsty demon, a ghoul, in accordance with Eastern myth. But, as we have said, such interpretations are unnecessary and unsupported by sufficient authority. The allusion to the  tastes of the leech is found elsewhere. Thus Theocritus, 'Idyll.,' 2:55 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> And Plautus, 'Epidic.,' 2:2, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Jam ego me convortam in hirudinem atque<br />Eorum exsugebo sanguinem,<br />Senati qui columen cluent."</span> Ewald and others find traces of mutilation in this proverb, and endeavour to supply what is lost in various ways; but the text as it stands is intelligible, and needs no addition. The rest of the verse is an application of the truth first stated. The type of cupidity there enunciated is instanced and exemplified in four special cases. <span class="cmt_word">There are three things that are never satisfied.</span> And then a corrective climax is addressed. Yea, <span class="cmt_word">four things say not, It is enough.</span> The four in the following verse are divided into two plus two. Septuagint, "The leech had three daughters dearly beloved, and these three did not satisfy her, and the fourth was not contented to say, Enough."

Horace talks of a man as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Victima nil miserantis Orci."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Carm.,' 2:3, 24.</span>) And Hesiod ('Theog.,' 456) of Hades as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="accented">"A heart possessing that no pity knows."</span> The second thing is the barren womb; "the closing of the womb," as <a href="../../par/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>. The burning desire for children, characteristic of an Israelitish wife, is here denoted, like the passionate cry of Rachel to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die" (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>). The barren woman, says Corn. a Lapide, " concubitus magis est avida quam ceterae tum propter desiderium habendae prolis, tum quod foecundae et gravidae naturaliter non appetant concubitum." The third insatiable thing is <span class="cmt_word">the earth that is not filled</span> (<span class="accented">satisfied</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with water</span>; the parched and thirsty soil which no amount of water can satisfy, which drinks in all that is poured upon it and is not benefited, what Virgil ('Georg.,' 1:114) calls "bibula arena." <span class="cmt_word">The fourth is the fire that saith not,</span> <span class="cmt_word">It is enough;</span> the "devouring element," as the newspapers term it. The more you heap on fire, the more material you supply, the fiercer it rages. Septuagint, "Hades, and the love of woman, and earth not satisfied with water, and water, and fire, will not say, It sufficeth." Cheyne and others quote from the Sanscrit 'Hitopadesa,' "Fire is never satisfied with fuel; nor the ocean with rivers; nor death with all creatures; nor bright-eyed women with men." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a></div><div class="verse">The eye <i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father, and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This is an independent proverb, only connected with the preceding by being founded on an allusion to an animal. <span class="cmt_word">The eye that mocketh at his father.</span> The eye is named as the mind's instrument for expressing scorn and insubordination; it is the index to the inner feeling; and look may be as sinful as action. <span class="cmt_word">And despiseth to obey his mother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. holds obedience to his mother to be a thing of no importance whatever. The word translated "to obey" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;</span>) is rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">partum</span>; by others, "weakness," or "wrinkles," or "old age," as Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. But etymology has led most modern commentators to give the sense of "obedience" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ravens of the valley shall pick it out.</span> Such an undutiful son shall die a violent death; his corpse shall lie unburied, and the birds of prey shall feed upon him. It is well known that ravens, vultures, and other birds that live on carrion first attack the eyes of their prey; and in our own islands we are told crows and birds of this sort will fix on the eyes of young or sickly animals. Corn. a Lapide quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 108:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus,<br />Intestina canes, cetera membra lupi."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His eyes, plucked out, let croaking ravens gorge,<br />His bowels dogs, his limbs the greedy wolves."</span> The valley, or brook, reminds one of Elijah's miraculous support (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Young eagles.</span> The <span class="accented">nesher</span> must here mean one of the vulture tribe, as eagles do not feed on carrion (but see <a href="../../par/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:49) applies the proverb thus: "'The eye that sneereth at his father, and despiseth the travail of his mother, lo! the ravens from the torrents shall pick it out.' For bad men, while they find limit with the judgments of God, do 'sneer at their Father;' and heretics of all sorts, whilst in mocking they contemn the preaching of holy Church and her fruitfulness, what else is this but that they 'despise the travail of their mother'? whom we not unjustly call the mother of them as well, because from the same they come forth, who speak against the same."

So Vulgate, <span class="accented">Viam viri in adolescentia</span>. But this is feeble, and <span class="accented">almah</span> is without doubt rightly rendered "maid," "virgin." The proverb says that the sinful act to which it alludes leaves no outward sign by which it can generally be recognized; it escapes man's knowledge. This is exemplified and confirmed in the following verse. It is not sufficient to refer the saying to the insidious arts of the seducer, by which he saps the principles and inflames the passions of his victim. The sin of unchastity is signified, which demands secrecy and affords no token of its commission. Two of the above parallels, says Cheyne, are given in a quatrain of a Vedic hymn to Varuna - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The path of ships across the sea,<br />The soaring eagle's flight he knows."</span> Some of the Fathers and earlier commentators, and among moderns, Bishop Wordsworth, have not been content with the literal sense of this gnonic, but have found in it, as in the others, deep spiritual mysteries. Christ is the great Eagle (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>), who ascended beyond human ken; the serpent is the devil, who works his wily way in secret, and who tried to pass into the mind of Christ, who is the Rock; the ship is the Church, which preserves its course amid the waves of this troublesome world, though we cannot mark its strength or whither it is guided; and the fourth mystery is the incarnation of Jesus Christ our Lord, when "the virgin (<span class="accented">almah</span>) conceived and bare a son" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), when "a woman encompassed a man (<span class="accented">geber</span>)" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>). We can see the greater or less appropriateness of such accommodation, but the proverb must have been received by contemporaries only in its literal sense, whatever were the inner mysteries which the Holy Spirit wished to communicate thereby.

This startling vicissitude was not uncommon in Eastern states; and even if the slave was not preferred to regal power, he was often advanced by unwise favouritism to high position, for which he was wholly unfitted, and which he used only to aggrandize himself at the expense and to the injury of others,  This incongruity has been already noticed at Proverbs 19:10 (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">And a fool when he is filled with meat.</span> "Fool" is here <span class="accented">nabal</span>, a low, profligate fellow, who is rich and without care. When such a one rises to high position, or has power over others, he becomes arrogant, selfish, unbearable (comp. ver. 9; <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-12.htm">Proverbs 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).

The sentence does not refer to an unbeloved wife, a Leah, becoming the favourite, a Rachel; the expression, "when she is married," can hardly have this sense; but the gnome speaks of a woman who has passed much of her life without love, having nothing about her attractive either in looks, attainments, or manner, and is consequently soured and ill-tempered. If such a one does at last win a husband, she uses her new position to vex those who formerly depreciated her, and to make them as miserable as she cam <span class="cmt_word">And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</span> The maidservant that obtains her mistress's property, either by supplanting her or by right of inheritance, is supposed to make a bad use of it, to become conceited, arrogant, and odious to all around her. The LXX. transposes the last two members of the comparison, placing the unloved woman in the fourth place as the most intolerable of all: "And if a maidservant should cast out (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>) her own mistress, and a hateful woman should obtain a good husband."

The Vulgate has <span class="accented">minima</span>; but the original is not superlative, which would not be true of some of the creatures named. <span class="cmt_word">But they are exceeding wise;</span> "quick of wit, wise," the participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> meaning "rendered wise, cunning" (Delitzsch). The Septuagint and Vulgate translate in the comparatives. "These are wiser than the wise," the instincts of these animals being more marvellous than human wisdom.

He calls the ants a people, <span class="accented">am</span>, because they live in a community, and have authorities which they obey, and their actions are regulated by certain definite laws. So Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>) calls the locusts a nation, and Homer ('Iliad,' 2:87) speaks of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tribes of thronging bees." <span class="cmt_word">Yet they prepare their meat in the summer.</span> In countries where ants hybernate the object of this commended foresight is mistaken; but the statement, as that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, is in accordance with the popular belief of the day, and serves well to point the moral intended. We know certainly that in Europe these insects fill their nests with heterogeneous articles - grain, seeds, husks, etc., not as stores to be consumed in the winter, but for warmth and comfort's sake. Scripture is not intended to teach science; it speaks of such matters phenomenally, with no attempt at a precision which would not have been understood or appreciated by contemporaries. But in the present case more careful observation has confirmed the correctness of the asset. tions in our proverbs. In countries where, ants do not hybernate, they do make granaries for themselves in the summer, and use these supplies as food in the winter months (see note on Proverbs 6:8). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a></div><div class="verse">The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The conies are but a feeble folk.</span> The term "coney" (<span class="accented">cuniculus</span>) is applied to the rabbit, but this is not the animal here intended; and indeed rabbits are not found in Palestine. The word <span class="accented">shaphan</span> designates the <span class="accented">Hyrax Syriacus</span>, called by some the rock badger (see Hatrt, 'Animals of the Bible,' pp. 64, etc.). The coney, says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 2:90), "abounds in the gorge of the Kedron, and along the foot of the mountains west of the Dead Sea. It is of the size of the rabbit, but belongs to a very different order of animals, being placed by naturalists between the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. Its soft fur is brownish-grey over the back, with long black hairs rising through this lighter coat, and is almost white on the stomach; the tail is very short. The Jews, who were not scientific, deceived by the motion of its jaws in eating, which is exactly like that of ruminant animals, fancied it chewed the cud, though it did not divide the hoof, and so they put its flesh amidst that which was forbidden. It lives in companies, and chooses a ready-made cleft in the rocks for its home, so that, though the conies are but a 'feeble folk,' their refuge in the rocks gives them a security beyond that of stronger creatures. They are, moreover, 'exceeding wise,' so that it is very hard to capture one. Indeed, they are said, on high authority, to have sentries regularly placed on the look out while the rest are feeding; a squeak from the watchman sufficing to send the flock scudding to their holes like rabbits. The coney is found in many parts of Palestine, from Lebanon to the Dead Sea." <span class="cmt_word">In the rocks.</span> This fact is noticed in Psalm'civ. 18. The Septuagint calls them <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> here and <a href="../../par/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>, also in <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-6.htm">Leviticus 11:6</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-28.htm">Proverbs 30:28</a></div><div class="verse">The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The spider taketh hold with her hands.</span> <span class="accented">Semamith</span> or <span class="accented">shemamith</span> is some sort of lizard, probably the gecko. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint; <span class="accented">stellio</span>, Vulgate. The Authorized Version alludes either to its fanlike foot, which enables it to run up walls and to cling to ceilings, or to its power of exuding from its feet a certain poisonous humour by which it catches flies and other insects. But the above translation, as well as that of the Septuagint and the Vulgate <span class="accented">manibus nititur</span>, is incorrect, The first line, in accordance with the method pursued in the three cases previously, ought to give some expression denoting weakness or littleness, whereas by the above rendering it is rather strength and activity that are signified. The translation therefore should run, as in the Revised Version margin, "The lizard thou canst seize with thy hand," and yet it is in king's palaces. Small as it is, and easy to catch and crush, it is agile and clever enough to make its way into the very palace of the king, and to dwell there. Septuagint, "And the lizard, supporting itself by its hands, and being easy to catch (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), dwelleth in kings' strongholds." This combines the two interpretations given above. St. Gregory takes the lizard as the type of the simple, earnest man, who often succeeds better than the clever. "Many that are quick-witted, while they grow slack from carelessness, continue in bad practices, and the simple folk, which have no wing of ability to stand them in stead, the excellency of their practice bears up to attain to the walls of the eternal kingdom. Whereas, then, 'the lizard climbeth with his hands,' he 'is in kings' palaces;' in that the plain man, by earnestness of right practice, reaches that point whereunto the man of ability never mounts" ('Moral.,' 6:12, Oxford transl.). The ancient expositors see in these verses a presentation of the Church of God, weak on its human side and despised by men, yet exceeding wise (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>) - like the ant, laying up treasure in heaven, providing for death and eternity; like the coney, making the Rock her refuge; like the locusts, moving forward a mighty army in battle array; like the lizard, active in movement, holding the truth tenaciously, and dwelling in the palace of the great King.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31</a></div><div class="verse">A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A greyhound;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">zarzir mothnayim</span>), "girt in the loins" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, Symmachus), an expression very vague, and, as the name of an animal, occurring nowhere else in the Old Testament. In post-biblical Hebrew <span class="accented">zarzir is</span> found as the name of some pugnacious bird, and the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac call it here the cock. So also Aquila and Theodotion. But if the word is onomatopoetic, it would seem to apply with more propriety to one of the raven tribe; and then what is to be made of the allusion to the loins? And how comes it that amid the quadrupeds in the gnome a bird should suddenly be introduced, as one stately in going? It seems certain that some quadruped is here meant, but what? What animal has as characteristic tight-girded loins or slender or active loins? There are, indeed, many that might be so designated, but none that, as far as we know, appropriated this unique appellation. Hence various opinions are held by commentators concerning the identification. The zebra, say some, with its stripes, which may be thus denoted; the war horse, say others, comparing <a href="../../par/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19, 25</a>, and considering the trappings with which, as we see in ancient sculptures, he was adorned; others, again, fix upon the leopard as the beast intended. But that of the Authorized Version seems, on the whole, to be the most likely rendering, the slender, agile make of the greyhound having given cause for the appropriation of the term used in the text. Delitzsch compares the German word <span class="accented">windspiel</span>, which designates the greyhound without the necessity of using the full term, <span class="accented">wiadspielhund</span>. The only points which may be considered adverse to this view are these two, viz. the ill repute in which dogs were held by the Hebrews, Scripture consistently disparaging and despising them; and the fact that, as far as we have information, the Jews did not use  dogs for hunting purposes, though nowadays the Arabs keep a kind of Persian greyhound for sporting, and Assyrian monuments have familiarized us with the appearance of hounds employed in the chase of the lion and the wild ox. Agur may be referring to what he has seen elsewhere, but what was well known to these for whom he wrote. Gesenius suggests (253), "a warrior girt in the loins," which is adopted by Wordsworth, and gives a suitable idea. This would correspond with the king in the last line; but the interpretation is quite arbitrary, and supported by no ancient authority, resting on the fact that girding the loins is always spoken of human beings. The cock strutting among his hens is, as we have hinted, the idea which approves itself to many ancient translators. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. We are not disposed to adept this identification, more especially as common poultry were unknown in Palestine till long after Solomon's time. Certainly what we call cocks and hens, or barn door fowls, are never mentioned in the Old Testament. and seem to have been introduced from Persia after the rise of the Persian empire. The latest editors decide for the war horse; but the conflicting claims cannot be reconciled, and the matter must be left undetermined. <span class="cmt_word">An he goat also.</span> This is a very natural comparison, as the stately manner in which the he goat (<span class="accented">tay-ish</span>, "the butter") heads the flock has been always observed. The LXX. expresses this, paraphrasing, "and the he goat leading the herd." "Flocks of goats are very numerous in Palestine at this day, as they were in former ages. We see them everywhere on the mountains, in smaller or larger numbers; at times also along with sheep, as one flock, in which ease it is usually a he goat that is the special leader of the whole, walking before it as gravely as a sexton before the white flock of a church choir" (Geikie, 'Holy Land,' 1:232). <span class="cmt_word">A king, against whom there is no rising up;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">nec est rex qui resistat ei</span>, which ought to mean "and a king whom nothing resists," but can scarcely be compelled to produce this meaning without violence. The difficulty in the sentence arises from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the above rendering is regarded as composed of the negative <span class="accented">al</span>, and <span class="accented">kum</span>, the infinitive, "to rise against, oppose." But this is contrary to grammatical usage, and would be a solecism. To some it has seemed that a proper name was intended, and they have invented a King Alkum or Alkimos, whom they suppose to have been celebrated in or after Solomon's time. Many modern commentators take the word to be an Arabic expression, consisting of <span class="accented">al</span>, the definite article, and <span class="accented">kum</span>, "people," and consider the meaning to be "a king with whom is the people," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. surrounded by his people or army. This is certainly a stately sight, and may well stand parallel to the hero lion among beasts, and the bold he goat at the head of the flock. Other Arabic expressions may probably be found elsewhere in this chapter; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, vers. 15, 16, 17, <span class="accented">aluka</span>, etc. Septuagint, "a king haranguing before a nation (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." This passage, again, has been taken in a spiritual sense as referring to Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Warrior girt with the sword, the Leader of the flock, the King of kings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-32.htm">Proverbs 30:32</a></div><div class="verse">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - Agur's last proverb, exhorting to discreet demeanour. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>). If thou hast had the folly to be arrogant, proud, and overbearing in conduct. Or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. The verb <span class="accented">zamam</span>, though possibly used in a bad sense, "to devise evil," is more suitably rendered "to meditate," "purpose;" so here it is the thought of lifting up one's self that is censured, the act and the thought being contrasted. Hast thou acted arrogantly, or even only meditated doing so, restrain yourself, keep silence (<a href="../../par/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). St. Jerome gives a different rendering, enforcing another lesson, "There is one who shows himself a fool after he is raised to high position; if he had had understanding, he would have laid his hand on his mouth." Septuagint, "If thou give thyself up to mirth, and stretch forth thy hand in a quarrel, thou wilt be dishonoured." Insensate mirth and a quarrelsome disposition alike lead to disgrace. St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:10) applies the Vulgate rendering to antichrist, "For he in truth will be lifted up on high, when he will feign that he is God. But he will appear a fool when lifted up on high, because he will fail in his very loftiness through the coming of the true Judge. But if he had understood this, he would have laid his hand on his mouth; that is, if he had foreseen his punishment, when he began to be proud, having been once fashioned aright, he would not have been raised up to the boastfulness of such great pride" (Oxford transl.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/30-33.htm">Proverbs 30:33</a></div><div class="verse">Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter.</span> The same word, <span class="accented">mits</span>, is used for "churning," "wringing," and "forcing;" it means "pressure" in all the cases, though with a different application. At the present day milk is churned in the East by enclosing it in a leathern bottle, which is then suspended in the air and jerked to and fro till the butter is  produced. This process could scarcely be called "pressure," though, possibly, the squeezing of the udder is meant, as the Septuagint and Vulgate take it. But most probably the reference is to cheese, the term used, <span class="accented">chemah</span>, being applied indifferently to curdled milk and cheese. To produce this substance, the curdled milk is put into little baskets of rush or palm leaves, tied closely, and then pressed under heavy stones. What the proverb says is that, as the pressure applied to milk produces cheese, and as pressure applied to the nose brings blood, <span class="cmt_word">so the pressure of wrath bringeth forth strife;</span> the irritation and provocation of anger occasion quarrels and contentions. They say in Malabar, remarks Lane, "Anger is a stone cast into a wasp's nest." Septuagint, "Press out milk, and there shall be butter; and if thou violently squeeze the nostrils, blood will come forth; and if thou draw forth words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes." It is the third clause which is important, and to which the others lead up; and the verse must be taken in connection with the preceding, as enforcing the duty of self-restraint and silence under certain circumstances. Some of the Fathers, commenting on the Vulgate rendering (<span class="accented">Qui fortiter premit ubera ad eliciendum lac</span>, <span class="accented">exprimit butyrum</span>; <span class="accented">et qui vehementer emungit</span>, <span class="accented">elicit sanguinem</span>), apply the passage to the handling of the Word of God. Thus St Gregory ('Moral.,' 21:3), "Divine sentences require sometimes to be viewed externally, sometimes to be explored internally. For we 'press the udder strongly' when we weigh with minute understanding the word of sacred revelation, by which way of pressing whilst we seek milk, we find butter, because, whilst we seek to be fed with but a little insight, we are anointed with the abundance of interior richness. Which, nevertheless, we ought neither to do too much, nor at all times, lest, while milk is sought for from the udder, there should follow blood. For very often, persons, whilst they sift the words of sacred revelation more than they ought, fall into a carnal apprehension. For 'he draws forth blood who wringeth violently.' Since that is rendered carnal which is perceived by an overgreat sifting of the spirit" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/29.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 29"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 29" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/31.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 31"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 31" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm"><title>Proverbs 31 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/31.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/31.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/31-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/30.htm" title="Proverbs 30">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 31 <a href="../ecclesiastes/1.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a></div><div class="verse">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - Part VIII. SECOND APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Lemuel" on the subjects of impurity and intemperance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.</span> Who is intended by "Lemuel king" is much disputed. Those who connect the following word <span class="accented">massa</span> ("oracle") with the preceding <span class="accented">melek</span> ("king"), translate "King of Massa," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> (where see note). Of the country, or the king, or his mother, we have absolutely no information. The name Lemuel, or Lemoel (ver. 4), means "unto God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dedicated to God, like Lael (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); hence it is regarded by many authorities, ancient and modern, as an appellation of Solomon, one from infancy dedicated to God and celled by him Jedidiah, "beloved of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>). But there is nothing in the contents of this section to confirm this idea; indeed, there are expressions which militate against it. Possibly Hezekiah may be meant, and his remarkable piety somewhat confirms the opinion; yet we see no reason why he should be here addressed under a pseudonym, especially if we consider that he himself was concerned in making this collection. On the whole, it seems best to take Lemuel as a symbolical name, designating an ideal king, to whom an ideal mother addressed the exhortation which follows. Solomon's own proverbs contain many warnings against the very sins of which this mother speaks, so that the section is conceived in the spirit of the earlier portion of the book, though it is assigned to a different author and another age. <span class="accented">The prophecy</span> (<span class="accented">massa</span>); the inspired utterance (see on ch. 30:1). This maternal counsel forms one compact exhortation, which might with more propriety be so termed than the words of Agur. <span class="accented">His mother.</span> The mother of a reigning king was always regarded with the utmost respect, taking precedence of the king's wife. Hence we so often find the names of kings' mothers in the sacred record; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. It is difficult to say what reading was seen by the LXX., who render, "My words have been spoken by God, the oracle of a king whom his mother instructed." There are many wise women mentioned in Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Miriam, Deborah, the Queen of Sheba, Huldah, etc., so there is nothing incongruous in Lemuel being instructed by his mother in wisdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a></div><div class="verse">What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-9.</span> - Here follows <span class="accented">the exhortation</span>, which seems to come from the same source as the "burden" of Agur above. In this section the connection and parallelism of the parts are exhibited by repetition of thought and often of words in the several clauses. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What, my son?</span> <span class="accented">Mah</span>, "what," is repeated thrice, both to enforce the attention of the son, and to show the mother's anxious care for his good. She feels the vast importance of the occasion, and asks as in perplexity, "What shall I say? What advice shall I give thee?" "Son" is here not <span class="accented">ben</span>, but <span class="accented">bar</span>, one of the Aramaic forms which are found in these two last chapters. The word occurs also in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Son of my vows.</span> This might mean, "son who wast asked in prayer," like Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), and dedicated to God, as the name Lemuel implies; or it may signify, "thou who art the object of my daily vows and prayers." Septuagint, "What, my son, wilt thou observe (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)? What? the sayings of God. My firstborn son, to thee I speak. What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-3.htm">Proverbs 31:3</a></div><div class="verse">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to chastity. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Give not thy strength unto women</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9</a>). <span class="accented">Chayil</span> is "vigour," the bodily powers, which are sapped and enervated by sensuality. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">substantiam tuam</span>; but the prayerful, anxious mother would consider rather her son's personal well being than his worldly circumstances, which, indeed, an Eastern monarch's licentiousness would not necessarily impair. Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings; or, with a slight alteration in the punctuation (and an improved parallelism), <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="accented">them that destroy kings</span>; "expugnatricibus regum," as Schultens terms them. Women are meant; and the prince is enjoined not to surrender his  life, conduct, and actions to the influence of women, who, both by the dissipation and sensuality which they occasion, and the quarrels which they provoke, and the evil counsels which they give, often ruin kings and states (see the injunction, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>). The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">ad delendos reges</span>, looks as if the warning was against making wars of conquest against neighbouring kings; but this is not a satisfactory parallel to the former clause. Septuagint, "Give not thy wealth unto women, nor thy mind, nor thy life unto remorse (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Do all things with counsel; drink wine with counsel." This seems to belong to the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> not for kings, O Lemuel, <i>it is</i> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">second admonition.</span> A warning against inebriety, and concerning a proper use of strong drink. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not for kings;</span> or, as others read, <span class="accented">far be it from kings.</span> The injunction is repeated to indicate its vast importance. <span class="cmt_word">Nor for princes strong drink;</span> literally, <span class="accented">nor for princes</span> (the word), <span class="accented">Where is</span> <span class="accented">strong drink</span>? (see on Proverbs 20:1; and comp. <a href="../../par/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>). The evils of intemperance, flagrant enough in the case of a private person, are greatly enhanced in the case of a king, whose misdeeds may affect a whole community, as the next verse intimates. St. Jerome reads differently, translating, "Because there is no secret where drunkenness reigns." This is in accordance with the proverb, "When wine goes in the secret comes out;" and, "Where drink enters, wisdom departs;" and again, "Quod latet in mente sobrii, hoc natat in ore ebrii." Septuagint, "The powerful are irascible, but let them not drink wine." "Drunkenness," says Jeremy Taylor ('Holy Living,' ch. 3, &sect; 2), "opens all the sanctuaries of nature, and discovers the nakedness of the soul, all its weaknesses and follies; it multiplies sins and discovers them; it makes a man incapable of being a private friend or a public counsellor. It taketh a man's soul into slavery and imprisonment more than any vice whatsoever, because it disarms a man of all his reason and his wisdom, whereby he might be cured, and, therefore, commonly it grows upon him with age; a drunkard being still more a fool and less a man."

Intemperance leads to selfish disregard of others' claims, an inability to examine questions impartially, and consequent perversion of justice. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>) speaks of intoxication as inducing men to "justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him."

As a restorative, a cordial, or a medicine, wine may he advantageously used; it has a place in the providential economy of God. "Use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities," was St. Paul's advice to Timothy (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>). It is supposed to have been in consideration of the injunction in the text that the ladies of Jerusalem provided for criminals on their way to the place of execution a drink of medicated wine, which might deaden the pain of suffering. This was the draught rejected by Christ, who willed to taste the full bitterness of death (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>). The Septuagint has, "to those that are in sorrow;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">maerentibus</span>, but this makes the two clauses tautological. <span class="cmt_word">Wine unto those that be of heavy hearts</span> (<a href="../../par/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>). "Wine," says the psalmist, "maketh glad the heart of man" (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Says Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:261 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Great is the strength <br />Which generous wine imparts to wearied men."</span> Wine, says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in Ephes.,' 19), "has been given us for cheerfulness, not for drunkenness. Wouldest thou know where wine is good? Hear what the Scripture saith, 'Give wine to them, etc. And justly, because it can mitigate asperity and gloominess, and drive away clouds from the brow" (comp. Ecclus. 34 [31]:25, etc.).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a></div><div class="verse">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-31.</span> - Part IX. THIRD APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION. This section contains an ode in praise of the virtuous woman, derived from a different source from that of the words of Agur, and belonging to a different age (see Introduction). It is an acrostic; that is, each verse begins with one of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, arranged in the usual order. We may compare this <span class="accented">mashal</span> with the alphabetical psalms, "Psalmi abcedarii," which are, more or less, of similar structure, but of which one only, the hundred and nineteenth, is so marked in the English versions. Other examples are <a href="../../par/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 145</a>; also <a href="../../par/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1, 2</a>, and 3. One object of this artificial construction was to render the matter easier to commit to memory. The spiritual expositors see in this description of the virtuous woman a prophetic representation of the Church of Christ in her truth and purity and influence. Thus Bode: "Hic sapientissimus regum Salomon laudes sanctae Ecclesiae versibus paucis sed plenissima veritate depingit....  Cujus (carminis) ordine perfectissimo alphabeti typice innuitur, quam plenissime hic vel animae cujusque fidelis, vel totius sanctae Ecclesiae, quae ex omnibus electis animabus una perficitur Catholica, virtutes ac praemia describantur." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - ALEPH. <span class="cmt_word">Who can find a virtuous woman?</span> The expression, <span class="accented">ishshah chayil</span>, "woman of force," has occurred in ch. 12:4 (where see note). <span class="accented">Mulierem</span> <span class="accented">fortem</span>, St. Jerome terms her; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is the rendering of the LXX., which places this section as the end of the whole Book of Proverbs. The expression combines the ideas of moral goodness and bodily vigour and activity. It is useless to try to fix the character upon any particular person. The representation is that of an ideal woman - the perfect housewife, the chaste helpmate of her husband, upright, God-fearing, economical, wise. See an anticipation of this character (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a>); and a very different view (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>). It is very remarkable to meet with such a delineation of woman in the East, where the female generally occupies a most degraded position, and is cut off from all sphere of activity and administration. To paint such a portrait needed inspiration of some sort. Such a one is hard to find. <span class="cmt_word">Her price is far above rubies;</span> or, <span class="accented">pearls</span> (see on Proverbs 20:15 and Proverbs 3:15). Septuagint, "Such a one is more valuable than precious stones." There may be allusion to the custom of giving treasure in exchange for a wife, purchasing her, as it were, from her friends (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). At any rate, few only are privileged to meet with this excellent wife, and her worth cannot be estimated by any material object, however costly. St. Jerome, with a slight difference in the reading, has, <span class="accented">Procul, et de ultimis finibus pretium ejus</span>. You may go to the ends of the earth to find her equal in value. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-11.htm">Proverbs 31:11</a></div><div class="verse">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - BETH. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of her husband cloth safely trust in her.</span> The husband of such a wife goes forth to his daily occupations, having full confidence in her whom he leaves at home, that she will act discreetly, and promote his interests while he is absent (see the contrast in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-20.htm">Proverbs 7:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that he shall have no need of spoil;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he shall not lack gain</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>). The wife manages domestic concerns so well that her husband finds his honest gains increase, and sees his confidence profitably rewarded. Septuagint, "Such a woman shall want not fair spoils." It is obvious to see in this an adumbration of the Church winning souls from the power of the enemy, especially as <span class="accented">shalal</span> is used for an enemy's spoils (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>; and elsewhere). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-12.htm">Proverbs 31:12</a></div><div class="verse">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - GIMEL. <span class="cmt_word">She will do him good and not evil</span> (comp. Ecclus. 26:1-3). She is consistent in her conduct towards her husband, always pursuing his best interests. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of her life;</span> in good times or bad, in the early spring time of young affection, and in the waning years of declining age. Her love, based on high principles, knows no change or diminution. The old commentator refers to the conduct of St. Monies to her unbelieving and unfaithful  husband, narrated by St. Augustine in his 'Confessions,' 9:9: "Having been given over to a husband, she served him as her lord; and busied herself to win him to thee, revealing thee to him by her virtues, in which thou madest her beautiful, and reverently amiable, and admirable to her husband." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13</a></div><div class="verse">She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - DALETH. <span class="cmt_word">She seeketh wool, and flax.</span> She pays attention to these things, as materials for clothing and domestic uses. Wool has been used for clothing from the earliest times (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-47.htm">Leviticus 13:47</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>, etc.), and flax was largely cultivated for the manufacture of linen, the processes of drying, peeling, hackling, and spinning being well understood (see <a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1</a>, etc.). The prohibition about mixing wool and flax in a garment (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-11.htm">Deuteronomy 22:11</a>) was probably based on the idea that all mixtures made by the art of man are polluted, and that what is pure and simple, such as it is in its natural state, is alone proper for the use of the people of God. <span class="cmt_word">And worketh willingly with her hands;</span> or, <span class="accented">she worketh with her hands' pleasure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with willing hands. The rendering of the Revised Version margin, after Hitzig, "She worketh at the business of her hands," is feeble, and does not say much. What is meant is that she not only labours diligently herself, but finds pleasure in doing so, and this, not because she has none to help her, and is forced to do her own work (on the contrary, she is represented as rich, and at the head of a large household), but because she considers that labour is a duty for all, and that idleness is a transgression of a universal law. Septuagint, "Weaving (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) wool and flax; she makes it useful with her hands."

Septuagint, "She is like a ship trading from a distance, and she herself gathereth her livelihood." The expressions in the text point to active commercial operations by sea as well as land, such as we know to have been undertaken by Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and others (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), and such as the Hebrews must have noticed in the Phoenician cities, Sidon and Tyre. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-15.htm">Proverbs 31:15</a></div><div class="verse">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - VAV. <span class="cmt_word">She riseth also while it is yet night.</span> Before dawn she is up and stirring, to be ready for her daily occupation. A lamp is always kept burning at night in Eastern houses, and as it is of very small dimensions, the careful housewife has to rise at midnight to replenish the oil, and she often then begins her household work by grinding the corn or preparing something for next day's meals (comp. ver. 18). Early rising before any great undertaking is continually mentioned in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And giveth meat to her household;</span> <span class="accented">deditquae praedam domesticis suis</span>, Vulgate. The word for "meat" is <span class="accented">tereph</span>, which means "food torn in pieces" with the teeth (<a href="../../par/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>), and hence food to be eaten. The wife thus early prepares or distributes the food which will be wanted for the day. <span class="cmt_word">And a portion to her maidens.</span> <span class="accented">Chok</span>, "final portion," may apply either to work or food. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">cibaria</span>, "meat;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>, "tasks." The former, which is in accordance with <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>, would be merely a repetition of the second clause, the meat mentioned there being here called the allotted portion, and would be simply tautological. If we take it in the sense of "appointed labour," we get a new idea, very congruous with the housewife's activity (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14</a>, where the same word is used in the case of the enforced labour of the Israelites).

This seems at first sight a strange assertion to make concerning one of the weaker sex; but the phrase is metaphorically expressive of the energy and force with which she prepares herself for her work. Strength and vigour are, as it were, the girdle which she binds round her waist to enable her to conduct her operations with case and freedom. So we have a similar metaphor boldly applied to God (<a href="../../par/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>): "The Lord reigneth, he is apparelled with majesty; the Lord is  apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength" (cf. <a href="../../par/job/38-3.htm">Job 38:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Strengtheneth her arms</span>.

Her prudence and economy leave her a large surplus profit, which she contemplates with satisfaction. There is no suspicion of arrogance or conceit, The pleasure that is derived from duty done and successfully conducted business is legitimate and healthy, a providential reward of good works. Septuagint, "She tastes that it is good to work." This comfort and success spur her on to further and more continued exertion. <span class="cmt_word">Her candle</span> (<span class="accented">lamp</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>goeth not out by night</span>. She is not idle even when night falls, and outdoor occupations are cut short; she finds work for the hours of darkness, such as is mentioned in the next verse. One recalls Virgil's picture of the thrifty housewife ('AEneid,' 8:407) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Inde ubi prima quies medio jam noctis abactae<br />Curriculo expulerat somnum, cum femina primum,<br />Cui tolerare colo vitam tenuique Minerva <br />Impositum, cinerem et sopitos suscitat ignis,<br />Noctem addens operi, famulesque ad lumina longo<br />Exercet penso."</span> Some take the lamp here in an allegorical sense, as signifying life, happiness, and prosperity, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a> and Proverbs 20:20; others, as denoting a bright example of diligence and piety (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). But the simple meaning seems to be the one intended. Wordsworth notes that the passage in <a href="../../par/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which speaks of the "merchandise" of the false Church, also affirms that "the light of a candle" shall shine in her no more, the two metaphors in our passage applied to the true Church being there applied to Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/31-19.htm">Proverbs 31:19</a></div><div class="verse">She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - YODH. <span class="cmt_word">She layeth her hands to the spindle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. (<span class="accented">kishor</span>, a word not occurring elsewhere) is probably not the spindle, but the distaff, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the staff to which is tied the bunch of flax from which the spinning wheel draws the thread. To this she applies her hand; she deftly performs the work of spinning her flax into thread. <span class="cmt_word">Her hands hold the distsaff.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">pelek</span>) is the spindle, the cylindrical wood (afterwards the wheel) on which the thread winds itself as it is spun. The hands could not be spared to hold the distaff as well as the spindle, so the first clause should run, "She stretches her hand towards the distaff." In the former clause <span class="accented">kishor</span> occasioned some difficulty to the early translators, who did not view the word as connected with the process of spinning. The Septuagint translates, "She stretches out her arms to useful works (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Manum suam misit ad fortia.</span> So Aquila and Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. This rather impedes the parallelism of the two clauses. There was nothing derogatory in women of high rank spinning among their maidens, just as in the Middle Ages noble ladies worked at tapestry with their attendants. We remember how Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, was found sitting in the midst of her handmaids, carding wool and spinning (Livy, 1:57). Catullus, in his 'Epithal. Pel. et Thet.,' 312, describes the process of spinning ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Laeva colum molli lana retinebat amictum;<br />Dextera tum leviter deducens fila supinis<br />Formabat digitis; tum prono in pollice torquens<br />Libratum tereti versabat turbine fusum."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Carm.,' 64.</span>)

"Hand," is here <span class="accented">yod</span>, with its nerves and sinews ready for exertion (see on Proverbs 10:4); and the idea is that she puts forth her hand to raise and soothe the poor man, not being satisfied with dealing alms to him, but exercising the gentle ministries of a tender love. Septuagint, "She opens her hands to the needy, and reaches forth her wrist (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) to the poor." Like Dorcas, she is full of good works and alms deeds (<a href="../../par/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>). It is doubtless implied that the prosperity which she experiences is the reward of this benevolence (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>).

Yet there are sometimes very snowy winters. That of 1879, for example, left behind it seventeen inches of snow, even where there was no  drift, and the strange spectacle of snow lying unmelted for two or three weeks was seen in the hollows on the hillsides. Thousands of years have wrought no change in this aspect of the winter months, for Bennaiah, one of David's mighty men, 'slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow' (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>)." She has no fears concerning the comfort and health of her family even in the severest winter. <span class="cmt_word">For all her household are clothed with scarlet;</span> with warm garments. The word used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shanim</span>), derived from a verb meaning "to shine," and denoting a crimson or deep scarlet colour. This colour was supposed, and rightly, to absorb and retain heat, as white to repel it; being made of wool, the garments would be warm as well as stately in appearance. St. Jerome has <span class="accented">duplicibus</span> (<span class="accented">shenaim</span>), "with double garments," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with one over the other. Warm garments were the more necessary as the only means of heating rooms was the introduction of portable chafing dishes containing bunting charcoal (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>, etc). The Septuagint has taken liberties with the text, "Her husband is not anxious concerning domestic matters when he tarries anywhere [<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;</span> for which Delitzsch suggests <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;</span>], for all her household are well clothed." Spiritually, the Church fears not the severity of temptation or the chill of unbelief, when her children take refuge in the blood of Christ.

The wife dresses herself in a way becoming her station, avoiding the extremes of sordid simplicity and ostentatious luxury. "For my own part," says St. Francois de Sales, quoted by Lesetre, "I should wish any devout man or woman always to be the best dressed person in the company, but at the same time, the least fine and affected, and adorned, as it is said, with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. St. Louis said that every one ought to dress according to his position, so that good and sensible people should not be able to say you are overdressed, nor the younger under dressed" ('Vie Devot.,' 3:25). So the Church is clothed in fine linen, clean and white, even the righteousness which Christ bestows (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), and invested in her Lord's royal robe, who hath made her children kings and priests unto God (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).

Girdles were necessary articles of attire with the flowing robes of Eastern dress The common kind were made of leather, as is the use at the present day; but a more costly article was of linen curiously worked in gold and silver thread, and studded with jewels and gold (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-11.htm">2 Samuel 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>).

Plato, 'Alcib. I.,' p. 123, B). Such rich and elaborately worked girdles the mistress could readily barter with Phoenician merchants, who would give in exchange purple (ver. 22) and other articles of use or luxury. On this passage St. Gregory thus moralizes: "What is signified by a garment of fine linen, but the subtle texture of holy preaching? In which men rest softly, because the mind of the faithful is refreshed therein by heavenly hope. Whence also the animals are shown to Peter in a linen sheet, because the souls of sinners mercifully gathered together are enclosed in the gentle quiet of faith. The Church therefore made and sold this fine garment, because she inparted in words that faith which she had woven by belief; and received from unbelievers a life of upright conversation. And she delivered a girdle to the Canaanite, because by the might of the righteousness she displayed, she constrained the lax doings of the Gentile world, in order that that might be maintained in their doings which is commanded.

When she speaks, it is not gossip, or slander, or idle talk, that she utters, but sentences of prudence and sound sense, such as may minister grace to the hearers. The Septuagint has this verse before ver. 25, and the first hemistich Again. after ver. 27. So in <a href="../../par/lamentations/2.htm">Lamentations 2, 3, 4</a>, the <span class="accented">pe</span> and <span class="accented">ayin</span> vetoes change places. This is also the case in <a href="../../par/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>.

She is of the opinion of the apostle who said "that if any would not work, neither should he eat" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>). Septuagint, "The ways of her house are confined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), and she eats not idle bread." The first of these clauses may mean that the proceedings of her household, being confined to a narrow circle, are readily supervised. But the meaning is very doubtful; and Schleusner renders, "continuae conversationes in aedibus ejus." St. Gregory applies our verse to the conscience, thus: "She considers the ways of her house, because she accurately examines all the thoughts of her conscience. She eateth not her bread in idleness, because that which she learned out of Holy Scripture by her understanding, she places before the eyes of the Judge by exhibiting it in her works" ('Moral.,' 35:47).

Roman Catholic commentators have, with much ingenuity, applied the whole description of the virtuous woman, and especially the present verse, to the Virgin Mary. We may regard it as a representation of the truly Christian matron, who loves husband and children, guides the house, is discreet, chaste, good, a teacher of good things (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>, etc.).

Neither of them is of any real value unless accompanied by religion.

Such, too, is the conclusion of Ecclesiastes (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>), "Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." Septuagint, "False are charms (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and vain is the beauty of woman; for a prudent woman is blessed, and let her praise the fear of the Lord."

She needs no farfetched laudation; her life long actions speak for themselves. Where men most congregate, where the heads of the people meet in solemn assembly, there her praise is sung, and a unanimous verdict assigns to her the highest honour. Septuagint, "Let her husband be praised in the gates." This frequent introduction of the husband is cuprous. St. Gregory thus spiritualizes the passage: "As the entrance of a city is called the gate, so is the day of judgment the gate of the kingdom, since all the elect go in thereby to the glory of their heavenly country.... Of these gates Solomon says, 'Give her of the fruit of her hands, and her own works shall praise her in the gates.' For holy Church then receives of 'the fruit of her hands,' when the recompensing of her labour raises her up to the possession of heavenly blessings; for her 'works then praise her in the gates,' when in the very entrance to his kingdom the words are spoken to his members, 'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,' etc." ('Moral.,' 6:9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/30.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 30"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 30" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm"><title>Proverbs 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/2.htm" title="Proverbs 2">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 3 <a href="../proverbs/4.htm" title="Proverbs 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - 4. <span class="accented">Fourth admonitory discourse.</span> The third chapter introduces us to a group of admonitions, and the first of these (vers. 1-18) forms the fourth admonitory discourse of the teacher. To all intents and purposes this is a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter, for inasmuch as that described the benefits, spiritual and moral, which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom, in promoting godliness and providing safety from evil companions, so this in like manner depicts the gain flowing from Wisdom, the happiness of the man who finds Wisdom, and the favour which he meets with both with God and man. The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God's afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise  of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom. The transition in thought from the former to the latter part of the discourse is easy and natural. Obedience and trust are represented as bringing favour, guidance, and health - in a word, prosperity. But God is not only to be honoured in times of prosperity, but also in adversity his loving hand is to be recognized; and in this submission to his will is true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) serves to externally connect this discourse with the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">Forget not my law.</span> This admonition bears a strong resemblance to that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, though the terms employed are somewhat different, <span class="accented">torah</span> and <span class="accented">mits'oth</span> here occupying the place respectively of <span class="accented">musar</span> and <span class="accented">torah</span> in that passage. <span class="accented">My law</span> (<span class="accented">torathi</span>), is literally, <span class="accented">my teaching</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, from the root <span class="accented">yarah</span>, "to teach." The <span class="accented">torah</span> is the whole body of salutary doctrine, and designates "Law" from the standpoint of teaching. Forgetting here is not So much oblivion arising from defective memory, as a wilful disregard and neglect of the admonitions of the teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart</span> (<span class="accented">libekha</span>); Vulgate<span class="accented">, cor</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and so the sum total of the affections. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">yitstsor</span>, from <span class="accented">notsar</span>, "to keep, or observe that which is commanded." The word is of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, and appears about twenty-five times. <span class="cmt_word">My commandments</span> (<span class="accented">mits'othay</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">praecepta mea</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my precepts. The Hebrew verb from which it is derived means "to command, or prescribe." The law and commandments here alluded to are those which immediately follow, from ver. 3 onwards. The three main ideas combined in this verse are remembrance, affection, and obedience. Remembering the law or teaching will depend, to a large extent, on the interest felt in that law; and the admonition to "forget not" is an admonition to give "earnest heed," so that the law or teaching may be firmly fixed in the mind. In using the words, "let thy heart keep," the teacher goes to the root of the matter. There may be an historical remembrance of, or an intellectual assent to, the commandments, but these are insufficient, for the keeping of the commandments must be based on the recognition of the fact that the affections of the heart are to be employed in the service of God, the keeping of the commandments is to be a labour of love. Again, the expression, "keep my commandments," implies, of course, external conformity to their requirements: we are "to observe to do them" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-1.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>); but it implies, further, spiritual obedience, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an obedience with which love is combined (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), and which arises from the inward principles of the heart being in harmony with the spirit of the commandments (see Wardlaw). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Length of days</span> (<span class="accented">orek yamim</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">longitudo dierum.</span> The expression is literally "extension of days," and signifies the prolongation of life, its duration to the appointed limit - a meaning which is brought out in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "length of days," the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being used, not of existence, but of the time and course of life. It occurs again in ver. 16, and also in <a href="../../par/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. "Length of days" is represented as a blessing in the Old Testament, depending, however, as in the present instance, on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Thus in the fifth commandment it is appended to the honouring of parents (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and it was promised to Solomon, at Gibeon, on the condition that he walked in the way, statutes, and commandments of God (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). The promise of prolongation of life is not to be pressed historically as applying to every individual case, but is to be taken as indicating the tendency of keeping the Divine precepts, which, as a rule, ensure preservation of health, and hence "length of days." <span class="cmt_word">Long life</span> (<span class="accented">vush'noth khayyim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">years of life</span>; Targum Jonathan, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, <span class="accented">anni vitae</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely serves to bring out the sense of the original, as there is practically no difference in meaning between "length of days" and "long life? The idea conveyed in the expression, "years of life," is that of material prosperity. The thought of an extended life is carried on from the preceding expression, but it is amplified and described. The years of life will be many, but they will be years of life in its truest sense, as one of true happiness and enjoyment, free from distracting cares, sickness, and other drawbacks. The Hebrew plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, "lives," is equivalent to the Greek expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "a life worth while living" (cf. Plat., 'Apol.,' 38, A). To the Israelitish mind, the happiness of life consisted in "dwelling in the land" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>, etc.), and "abiding in the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a>) (Zockler). The conjecture that the plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, signifies the present and the future  life, is unfounded. The scope of the promise before us is confined to the present stage of existence, and it is negatived also by the similar use of the plural in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>, "In the light of the king's countenance is life (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," where <span class="accented">khayyim</span> cannot possibly refer to the future life. <span class="accented">Khayyim</span> stands for life in its fulness. "Godliness" has indeed, as St. Paul wrote to Timothy, "promise of the life that now is, aud of that which is to come" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Peace</span> (<span class="accented">shalom</span>). The verb <span class="accented">shalam</span>, from which the substantive <span class="accented">shalom</span> is derived, signifies "to be whole, sound, safe," and hence "peace" means internal and external contentment, and tran-quillity of mind arising from the sense of safety. In ver. 17 the ways of Wisdom are designated <span class="accented">peace.</span> While, on the one hand, peace is represented by the psalmist as the possession of those who love God's Law (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>), on the other, it is denied the wicked (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall they add to thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall the precepts and commands bring (Zockler) or heap upon (Muffet) thee.

The radical meaning of the word is "ardent desire," from the root <span class="accented">khasad</span>, "to eagerly or ardently desire." Delitzsch describes it as "well affectedness." Predicated of God, it indicates God's love and grace towards man; predicated of man, it signifies man's love toward s God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> piety, or man's love towards his neighbour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> humanity. Where this mercy or love is exhibited in man it finds expression in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual outward help; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> forgiveness of offences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sympathy of feeling, which leads to interchange of thought, and so to the development of the spiritual life (see Elster, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word carries with it the ideas of kindlim as, benignity (Targum, <span class="accented">benignitas</span>), and grace (Syriac, <span class="accented">gratia</span>)<span class="accented">. Truth</span> (<span class="accented">emeth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">firmness</span>, or <span class="accented">stability</span>, and so fidelity in which one performs one's promise. Truth is that absolute integrity of character, beth in word and deed, which secures the unhesitating confidence of all (Wardlaw). Umbreit and Elster designate it as inward truthfulness, the <span class="accented">pectus rectum</span>, the very essence of a true man. As <span class="accented">khesed</span> excludes all selfishness and hate, so <span class="accented">emeth</span> excludes all hypocrisy and dissimulation. These two virtues are frequently combined in the Proverbs (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>) and Psalms (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4-11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/108-5.htm">Psalm 108:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a>), and, when predicated of man, indicate the highest normal standard of moral perfection (Zockler). The two ideas are again brought together in the New Testament phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, "to speak the truth in love" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>). There seems little ground for the remark of Salasius, that "mercy" refers to our neighbours, and "truth" to God. Each virtue, in fact, has a twofold reference - one to God, the other to man. The promise in ver. 4, that the exercise of these virtues procures favour with God and man, implies this twofold aspect. Bind them about thy neck; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as ornaments worn about the neck (Gejerus, Zockler); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as amulets or talismans, which were worn from a superstitious notion to ward off danger (Umbreit and Vaihinger); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as treasures which one wears attached to the neck by a chain to guard against their loss (Hitzig); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> as a signet, which was carried on a string round the neck (Delitzsch). The true reference of the passage seems to lie between (1) and (3). The latter adapts itself to the parallel expression, "Write them on the tablet of thine heart," and also agrees with <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>, "Tie them about thy neck," the idea being that of their careful preservation against loss. The former meaning, however, seems preferable. Mercy and truth are to be ornaments of the character, to be bound round the neck, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worn at all times (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, "For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thine head, and chains about thy neck." See also <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>). The imagery of the binding is evidently taken from <a href="../../par/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, and is suggestive of the tephillim, or phylacteries. <span class="cmt_word">Write them upon the table of thine heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> inscribe them. mercy and truth, deeply there, impress them thoroughly and indelibly upon thine heart, so that they may never be forgotten, and may form the mainspring of your actions. The expression implies that the heart is to be in entire union with their dictates. <span class="accented">The table</span> (<span class="accented">luakh</span>) was the tablet expressly prepared for writing by being polished, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the writing table of <a href="../../par/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a>, which, however, was probably covered with wax.

The expression, "the tables of the heart," occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>); and is used by AEschylus, 'Pro.,' 789, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tablets of the heart."

So Delitzsch, Bertheau, Kamph. A true sagacity, prudence, or penetrating judgment will be adjudicated by God and man to him who possesses the internal excellence of love and truth. The Hebrew <span class="accented">sekel is</span> derived from <span class="accented">sakal</span>, "to act wisely or prudently," and has this intellectual meaning in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>). The Targum Jonathan reads, <span class="accented">intellectus et benignitas</span>, thus throwing the adjective into a substantival form; the Syriac, <span class="accented">intellectus</span> simply. Ewald, Hitzig, Zockler, and others, on the other hand, understand <span class="accented">sekel</span> as referring to the judgment formed of any one, the favourable opinion or view which is entertained of hint by others, and hence take it as <span class="accented">reputation</span>, or estimation. The man who has love and truth will be held in high esteem by God and man. Our objection to this rendering is that it does not seem to advance the meaning of the passage beyond that of "favour." Another, mentioned by Delitzsch, is that <span class="accented">sekel</span> is never used in any other sense than that of <span class="accented">intellectus</span> in the Mishle. The marginal reading, "good success," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prosperity, seems inadmissible here, as the hiph. <span class="accented">has'kil</span>, "to cause to prosper," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>, does not apply in this instance any more than in <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>, margin. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of God and man</span> (<span class="accented">b'eyney elohim v'adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the eyes of Elohim and man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the judgment of God and man (Zockler); Vulgate<span class="accented">, coram Deo et hominibus.</span> A simpler form of this phrase is found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>, where Samuel is said to have found favour with the Lord, and also with men. So in <a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a> Jesus found favour "with God and man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>). The two conditions of favor and sagacity, or prudence, are not to be assigned respectively to God and man (as Ewald and Hitzig), or that finding favour has reference more to God, and being deemed prudent refers more to man. The statement is universal. Both these conditions will be adjudged to the man who has mercy and truth by God in heaven and man on earth at the same time (see Delitszch). The LXX., "after favour," instead of the text, reads, "and provide good things in the sight of the Lord and men," quoted by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>).

It is the first lesson to be learnt by all, and no less necessary for the Jew than for the Christian. Without this reliance on or confidence in God, it is impossible to carry out any of the precepts of religion. <span class="accented">Batakh</span> is, properly, "to cling to," and so passes to the meaning of "to confide in," "to set one's hope and confidence upon." The preposition <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> indicates the direction which the confidence is to take (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lean</span> (<span class="accented">tishshaen</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">innitaris</span>; followed by <span class="accented">el</span>, like <span class="accented">b'takh</span>, with which it is very similar in meaning. <span class="accented">Shaan</span>, not used in kal, in hiph. signifies "to lean upon, rest upon," just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use, <span class="accented">to repose confidence in</span>, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 17</a> (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not to <span class="accented">use</span> our own understanding (<span class="accented">binab</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>. "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom," etc. The teacher points out not only where  we are to rely, but also where we are not to rely.

The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">yada</span> signifies "to know, recognize." To acknowledge God is, therefore, to recognize, in all our dealings and undertakings, God's overruling providence, which "shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will." It is not a mere theoretical acknowledgment, but one that engages the whole energies of the soul (Delitzsch), and sees in God power, wisdom, providence, goodness, and justice. This meaning is conveyed by the Vulgate <span class="accented">cogitare</span>, which is "to consider" in all parts, "to reflect upon." David's advice to his son Solomon is, "Know thou (<span class="accented">ola</span>) the God of thy father." We may well acknowledge Jehovah; for he "knoweth the way of the righteous" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). Acknowledging God also implies that we first ascertain whether what we are about to take in hand is in accordance with his precepts, and then look for his direction and illumination (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall direct thy paths</span> (<span class="accented">v'hu y'yashsher or'khotheyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he himself shall make them straight, or level, removing all obstacles out of the way; or they shall, under God's direction, prosper and come to a successful issue; they shall be virtuous, inasmuch as deviation into vice will be guarded against, and happy, because they are prosperous. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'hu</span> is emphatic, "he himself;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et ipse. Yashar</span>, piel. is "to make a way straight," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-21.htm">Proverbs 15:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>. Cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut straight" (see on Proverbs 11:5). God here binds himself by a covenant (Lapide). This power is properly attributed to God, for "it is not in man to direct his steps" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not wise in thine own eyes.</span> This admonition carries on the thought from the preceding verses (5, 6), approaching it from a different direction. It is a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit, and self-reliance. It says, in effect, "Trust in the Lord, do not trust in yourself." Wisdom, as Michaelis remarks, is to trust in God; to trust in yourself and in your own wisdom is unwisdom. God denounces this spirit: "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), because such a spirit leads to the prohibited self-dependence, and is inconsistent with "the tear of the Lord." The precept of the text is reiterated by St. Paul, especially in <a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not wise in your own conceits" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>). It commends humility. The diligent search for Wisdom is commanded. The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it (Plumptre). <span class="accented">In thine own eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in thine own estimation; <span class="accented">arbitrio tuo</span> (Trem. et Jun.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span> The connection of this with the first part of the verse becomes clear upon reflection. "The fear of the Lord" is true wisdom (<a href="../../par/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Fear the Lord, therefore, because it is the best corrective of one's own wisdom, which engenders arrogance, pride, presumption of mind, which, moreover, is deceptive and apt to lead to sin. The fear of the Lord has this other advantage - that it leads to the departure from evil (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>) It is the mark of the wise man that he fears the Lord, and departs from evil (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>). These precepts form the two elements of practical piety (Delitzsch), an eminent example of which as Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</span> A metaphorical expression, denoting the complete spiritual health which shall follow from fearing the Lord and departing from evil. <span class="accented">Health</span>, (<span class="accented">riph'uth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">healing</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x1f05;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">sanitas</span>; so Syriac and Arabic. The Targum Jonathan has <span class="accented">medicina</span>, "medicine," as the margin. The root <span class="accented">rapha</span> is properly "to sew together," and the secondary meaning, "to heal," is taken from the healing of a wound by sewing it up. Delitzsch, however, thinks <span class="accented">riph'uth</span> is not to be taken as a restoration from sickness, but as a raising up from enfeebled health, or a confirming of the strength which already exists. There shall be a continuance of health. Gesenius translates "refreshment." <span class="accented">To thy navel</span> (<span class="accented">l'shor'rekha</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">umbilico tuo</span>; so Targum Jonathan. <span class="accented">Shor</span> is "the navel," here used synecdochically for the whole body, just as "head" is put for the whole man (<a href="../../par/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>), "mouth" for the whole person speaking (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and "slow bellies" for depraved gluttons (<a href="../../par/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>) (Gejerus, Umbreit). The idea is expressed in the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic by "to thy body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">corpori tuo</span>). The navel is here regarded as the centre of vital strength. For the word, see <a href="../../par/songs/7-2.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>. This is the only place in the Proverbs where this word is found. Gesenius, however, takes <span class="accented">shor, or l'shor'rekha</span>, as standing col. lectively for the nerves, in which, he says, is the seat of strength, and translates accordingly, "Health (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshment) shall it be to thy nerves." <span class="accented">Marrow</span> (<span class="accented">shik'kuy</span>); literally, <span class="accented">watering</span> or <span class="accented">moistening</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">irrigatio.</span> Moistening is imparted to the bones by the marrow, and  thus they are strengthened: "His bones are moistened with marrow" (<a href="../../par/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>). Where there is an absence of marrow the drying up of the bones ensues, and hence their strength is impaired, and a general debility of the system sets in - they "wax old" (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>). The effect of a broken spirit is thus described: "A broken spirit drieth up the bones" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The physiological fact here brought forward is borne witness to by Cicero, 'In Tusc.:' "In visceribus atque medullis omne bonum condidisse naturam" (cf. Plato). The meaning of the passage is that, as health to the navel and marrow to the bones stand as representatives of physical strength, so the fear of the Lord, etc., is the spiritual strength of God's children.

The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the LXX. limits the wealth to that which is justly acquired, and so guards against the erroneous idea that God is honoured by the appropriation to his use of unlawful wealth or gain (Plumptre). The Israelites "honoured Jehovah with their substance" when they contributed towards the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and later when they assisted in the preparations for the building of the temple, and in the payment of tithes. The injunction may undoubtedly refer to tithes, and is in accordance with the requirement of the Mosaic Law on that and other points as to oblations, free will offerings, etc.; but it has a wider bearing and contemplates the use of wealth for all pious and charitable purposes (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>).

The firstfruits were presented by every Israelite to the priests, in token of gratitude and humble thankfulness to Jehovah, and consisted of the produce of the land in its natural state, or prepared for human food (Maclear, 'Old Test. Hist.,' bk. 4, c. 3, <span class="accented">a</span>). The "firstfruits" also carried with it the idea of the best. The custom of offering the firstfruits of the field and other revenues as a religious obligation was observed by ancient pagan nations (see Diod. Sic., 1:14; Plut., 'De Iside,' p. 377; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 18:2 (Zockler). Some of the ancient commentators find in this verse an argument for the support of the ministry. It is well known that the priests "lived of the sacrifice," and were "partakers of the altar," and as their support by these means tended to the maintenance of Divine worship, so those who supported them were in the highest degree "honoring God." The injunctions also show that the honouring of God does not consist simply of lip service, of humility and confidence in him, but also of external worship, and in corporeal things. They are not peculiar to Israel, but are binding on all. They oppose all <span class="accented">selfish</span> use of God's temporal gifts, and lead to the thought that, in obeying them, we are only giving back to God what are his own.

The <span class="accented">yekev</span> corresponded with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, mentioned in <a href="../../par/mark/12.htm">Mark 12</a>:l, and the Latin <span class="accented">lacus</span> (Ovid, 'Fasti,' 5:888; Pliny, 'Epist.,' 9:20; 'Colum. de Rust.,' 12:18): Cajeterus, indeed, reads, <span class="accented">lacus torcularii.</span> The word <span class="accented">yekev</span> is, however, used for the wine press itself in <a href="../../par/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-27.htm">2 Kings 6:27</a>. <span class="accented">Shall burst out</span> (<span class="accented">yiph'rotsu</span>); literally, <span class="accented">they shall extend themselves</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall overflow. <span class="accented">Parats</span>, "to break," is here used metaphorically in the sense of "to be redundant," "to overflow" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a></div><div class="verse">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord.</span> The teacher, in vers. 11 and 12, passes to another phase of life. The thought of prosperity suggests the opposite one of adversity. Abundant prosperity shall flow from honouring Jehovah, but he sometimes and not unfrequently sends affliction, and, indeed, without this life would be incomplete. The object of the exhortation is, as Delitzsch states, to show that, as in prosperity God should not be forgotten, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged by days of adversity. Submission is counselled on the ground that, when Jehovah afflicts, he does so in the spirit of love, and for good. The "chastening" and "correction," though presenting God in an attitude of anger, are in reality not the punishment of an irate God. The verse before us is evidently copied from <a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, "Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;" and the whole passage is cited again in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>). It has been said that ver. 11 expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and ver. 12 its solution (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Despise not</span> (<span class="accented">al-timas</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne abjicias</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb mass is first "to reject," and then "to despise and contemn." The Targum Jonathan puts the thought in a stronger form, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">execreris</span>, "do not curse." They despise the chastening of Jehovah who, when they see his hand in it, do not humbly and submissively bow, but resist and become refractory, or, as it is expressed in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>, when their "heart fretteth against the Lord." Job, notwithstanding his bitter complaints, was on the whole, and in his better moments, an example of the proper state of mind under correction (see <a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). Jonah, in treating contemptuously the procedure of God, is an exemplification of the contrary spirit, which is condemned implicitly in the text (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">Chastening</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>); i.e. correction not by reproof only, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> and Proverbs 8:30; but by punishment also. as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>. The meaning here is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is "instruction by punishment," discipline, or schooling (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Neither be weary</span> (<span class="accented">al-takots</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not loathe, abhor, feel disgust nor vexation towards. The expression, "do not loathe," is a climax to the other, "despise not." It represents a more deeply seated aversion to Jehovah's plans. Gesenius takes the primary meaning of <span class="accented">kuts</span> to be that of vomiting. The word before us certainly denotes loathing or nausea, and is used in this sense by the Israelites in their complaints against God and against Moses in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in quoting the passage, adopts the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "nor faint;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne deficias, i.e.</span> "do not give way to despondency." <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span>. This word, like <span class="accented">musar</span> above, has a twofold meaning of either punishment or chastening, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>; or reproof, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; 25:30; 5:12; 27:5; 29:15, where it also occurs. It is here used in the former sense. To loathe the correction of Jehovah is to allow it to completely estrange us from him. We faint under it when, by dwelling on or brooding over, or bemoaning the trial, the spirit sinks to faintness. To faint at correction ignores the belief in the truth that "all things work together for good to them that love God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - In this verse the motive for submissiveness to Jehovah's corrections is brought forward. They are corrections, but they are the corrections of love. One of the most touching relationships of life, and that with which we are most familiar, viz. that of father and son, is employed to reconcile us to Jehovah's afflictive dispensations. A comparison is drawn. God corrects those whom he loves after the same manner as a father corrects ("correcteth" has to be understood from the first hemistich) the  son whom he loves. The idea of the passage is evidently taken from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, "Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee." The idea of the paternal relationship of God to mankind is found elsewhere (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>), and especially finds expression in the Lord's prayer. When the truth of this passage is learned, we shall be drawn to, rather than repelled from, God by his corrections. The gracious end of earthly trials is expressed in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6, 2</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a> (Wardlaw). "These gracious words (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>.) are written in Holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us" (see Visitation Office). <span class="cmt_word">Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av eth-ben yir'tseh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">even as a father the son be delighteth in.</span> Various renderings have been given to this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch, De Wette, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, agree with the Authorized Version, and take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">vav, as</span> explicative, and <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," as a relative sentence. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> is used in this explanatory sense in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a> (see Gesenius, &sect; 155, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>). The relative <span class="accented">usher</span>, "whom," is omitted in the original, according to the rule that the relative is omitted, especially in poetry, where it would stand as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative case (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, "And he falls into the pit (which) he made;" and <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a>). We have the same elision of the relative in the English colloquial expression, "the friend I met" (see Gesenius, &sect; 123:3, <span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig and Zockler translate, "and holds him dear as a father his son." This, though grammatically correct, does not preserve the parallelism. It serves only to expand the idea of love, whereas the predominant idea of the verse is that of correction, to which love is an accessory idea (see Delitzsch). For similar parallels, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a> as before, and <a href="../../par/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>. In the comparison which is instituted, <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," corresponds with <span class="accented">eth asher ye'hav y'hovah</span>, "whom the Lord loveth," and not with <span class="accented">yokiah</span>, "correcteth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kamph translates, "and (dealeth) as a father (who) wisheth well to his son." This is substantially the same as the Authorized Version, except that in the relative sentence "son" is made accusative after <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, here translated, "wisheth well to," and the emitted relative (<span class="accented">asher</span>) is placed in the nominative instead of the accusative case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The variation in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "and scourgeth every son whom he rcceiveth," cited literally in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, evidently arises from the translators having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, (<span class="accented">yakev</span>), "he scourgeth" for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av</span>), "even as a father."

The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate <span class="accented">fructus.</span> In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a "tree of life." The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, "The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold." <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">karuts</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">aurum purum</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">aurum purissimum. Kharuts</span> is the poetic word for gold, so called, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Curtius); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being dug up, from the root <span class="accented">kharats</span>, "to cut into or dig up, to sharpen." It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (<span class="accented">keseph</span>). The word is translated "choice gold" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; "gold" simply in <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; "yellow gold" in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>; and "fine gold" in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as <span class="accented">effosum aurum</span>, "gold dug up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of "molten gold" (<span class="accented">aurum conflatum</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rubies</span> (Khetib, <span class="accented">p'niyim</span>; Keri, <span class="accented">p'ninim</span>). No unanimous opinion has been arrived at as to the real signification of the word here translated "rubies." The majority of the rabbins (among them Rashi), and Bochart, Hartman, Bohlen, Lee on <a href="../../par/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>, and Zockler, render it "pearls." Its meaning seems to lie between this and "corals," the rendering adopted by Michaelis, Gesenius, and Delitzsch (following Fleischer), who says that the Hebrew <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> corresponds with the Arabia word whose root idea is "shooting forth," and means "a branch." The peculiar branching form in which corm is found favours this opinion, which is strengthened by the passage in <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where we get additional information as to color, "They [the Nazarites] were more ruddy in body than rubies," a description of which would apply to "coral," but is scarcely applicable to "pearls." The various versions suggest the further idea that <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> was a descriptive word used to denote precious stones in general. The LXX. renders, "She is more precious than precious stones (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." So the Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic. The Vulgate renders. "She is more precious than all riches (<span class="accented">cunctis opibus</span>)." The word <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> only occurs here (Keri) and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-15.htm">Proverbs 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>; and in Job and Lamentations as above. This passage, as well as <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>, which is an almost literal repetition of it, are imitations of <a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>. The identification of <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> with "pearls" may have suggested our Lord's parable of the pearl of great price (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45, 46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the things thou canst desire</span> (<span class="accented">kal-khaphatseyka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">all thy desires.</span> Here everything in which you have pleasure, or all your precious things; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">omnia, quae desiderantur.</span> The comparison, which has risen from the less to the more valuable, culminates in this comprehensive expression. There is nothing, neither silver, gold, precious stones, nor anything precious, which is an equivalent (<span class="accented">shavah</span>) to Wisdom in value. How it shows, when everything is put before us to choose from, that, like Solomon at Gibeon, we should prefer wisdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-13</a>)! In the second half of this verse the LXX. substitutes, "No evil thing competes with her; she is well known to all that approach her." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The remaining three verses (16-18) state in what respects Wisdom is incomparable in value. <span class="cmt_word">Length of days</span>; <span class="accented">orek yamim</span>, as in ver. 2. Wisdom is here represented as holding in her right hand that which is previously promised to obedience. Length of days is the blessing of blessings, the condition of all prosperity and enjoyment, and hence is placed in the right hand, the chief place, for among the Hebrews and other Oriental nations, as also among the Greeks the right hand was regarded as the position of highest honour (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; 1 Macc. 10:63; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>); cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>. in which the psalmist says of Jehovah, "In thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore." The two hands, the right and the left, signify the abundance of Wisdom's gifts. <span class="cmt_word">Riches and honour</span> stand here for prosperity in general. The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-8.htm">Proverbs 8:8</a>, where riches are explained as "durable riches." A spiritual interpretation can, of course, be given to this passage - length of days being understood of eternal life; riches, of heavenly riches; and honour, not "the honour that cometh of men," but honour conferred by God (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>:44; <a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>); see Wardlaw, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The thought of the verse is, of course, that Wisdom not only holds these blessings in her hands, but also confers them on those who  seek her. The LXX. adds, "Out of her month proceedeth righteousness; justice and mercy she beareth upon her tongue;" possibly suggested by <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>. The words of the teacher remind us of the saying of Menander, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "He who excels in prudence possesses all things." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-17.htm">Proverbs 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ways of pleasantness</span> (<span class="accented">dar'key noam</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">viae pulchrae</span>; <span class="accented">LXX.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. Wisdom's ways are those in which substantial delight may be found. They are beautiful and lovely to look upon, and afford happiness. All her paths are peace (<span class="accented">v'kal-n'thivo-theyah shalom</span>); literally, as in the Authorized Version. "Peace," <span class="accented">shalom</span>, is not genitive as "pleasantness." The character of peace is stamped upon her paths, so that in speaking of Wisdom's paths we speak of peace. She brings tranquillity and serenity and blessedness. Her paths are free from strife and alarm, and they lead to peace. (On the distinction between "ways" and "paths" - the more open and the more private walks - see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A tree of life</span> (<span class="accented">ets-khayyim</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">lignum vitae</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. This expression obviously refers to "the tree of life" (<span class="accented">ets-hakayyim</span>), which was placed in the midst of the garden of Eden, and conferred immortality on those who ate of its fruit (Genisis 2:9; 3:22). So Wisdom becomes equally life giving to those who lay hold on her, who taste of her fruit. She communicates life in its manifold fulness and richness (so the plural "lives" indicates) to those who seize her firmly. What is predicated of Wisdom here is predicated in other passages (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>) of the fruit of the righteous, the fulfilment of desire, and a wholesome tongue. Each of these, the teacher says, is "a tree of life." Elster denies that there is any reference to "the tree of life," and classes the expression among those other figurative expressions - a "fountain of life," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> and Proverbs 14:27, and a "well of life." in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; but if it be once admitted that there is such a reference, and it be remembered also that Wisdom is the same as "the fear of the Lord," the point insisted on in the Proverbs and in Job, it seems difficult to deny that the teacher has in view the blessed immortality of which the tree of life in Paradise as the symbol. In this higher sense the term is used in the Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>). Wisdom restores to her worshippers the life which was lost in Adam (Cartwright). It is remarkable that the imagery here employed is confined to these two hooks. After the historical record in Genesis, no other sacred writers refer to the tree of life. Old ecclesiastical writers saw in the expression a reference to Christ's redeeming work. "The tree of life is the cross of Christ," <span class="accented">lignum vitae crux Christi</span> (quoted by Delitzsch). The symbol, Plumptre remarks, entered largely into the religious imagery of Assyria, Egypt, and Persia. <span class="cmt_word">To them that lay hold upon</span> (<span class="accented">lam-makhazikim</span>, hiph. participle); Vulgate, <span class="accented">his, qui apprehenderint</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">khazak</span>), "to tie fast," is in hiph. with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," to take hold of," "to seize any one." Happy is every one that retaineth her. In the original, the participle, "they retaining her" (<span class="accented">tom'keyah</span>), is plural, and the predicate, "happy" or "blessed" (<span class="accented">m'ushshar</span>), is singular. The latter is used distributively, and the construction is common (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>). The Authorized Version aptly renders the original. The necessity for "retaining" as well as "laying hold" of Wisdom is pointed out. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tamak</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "to hold fast something taken." Such will be blessed who hold Wisdom tenaciously and perseveringly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-26.</span> - 5. <span class="accented">Fifth hortatory discourse. Wisdom, the creative power of God, exhibited as the protection of those who fear God</span>. The teacher in this discourse presents Wisdom under a new aspect. Wisdom is the Divine power of God, by which he created the world, and by which he sustains the work of his hands and regulates the operations of nature. This eminence of Wisdom, in her intimate association with Jehovah, is made the basis of a renewed exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily in view. The elevated thought that Wisdom has her source in Jehovah might seem in itself an adequate and sufficient reason for the exhortation. But another motive is adduced intimately bound up with this view of Wisdom. Jehovah becomes the ground of confidence and the protection in all conditions of life of those who keep Wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth.</span> The emphatic position of the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, "the Lord," at the beginning of the sentence (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a>), as well as the nature of the discourse, indicates a new paragraph. The description of the creative Wisdom of Jehovah may have been suggested to the mind of the teacher by the mention of the tree of life, in ver. 18 (Zockler); but the connection between this and the preceding passage has to be sought for in something deeper. The scope of the teacher is to exhibit, and so to recommend, Wisdom in every respect, and after showing her excellence in man, he now  brings her forward as the medium of creation, and hence in her relation to God. <span class="accented">By wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sapientia</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. It is evident that Wisdom is here something more than an attribute of Jehovah. "By Wisdom" means "by, or through, the instrumentality of Wisdom." While the corresponding and parallel expressions, "understanding," "knowledge," militate against the idea of an hypostatizing of Wisdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> assigning to Wisdom a concrete and objective personality, yet the language is sufficiently strong, when we connect this passage with ch. 1. and 8, to warrant our regarding Wisdom as something apart from yet intimately connected with Jehovah, as an active agency employed by him, and hence this description may. be looked upon as an anticipation of that which is more fully developed in ch. 8, where the characteristics which are wanting here are there worked out at length. The rabbins evidently connected the passage before us, as well as ch. 1 and 8, with <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, by rendering <span class="accented">b'reshith</span>, "in the beginning." by <span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>, "by Wisdom." Our Lord identifies himself with the Divine Sophia, or Wisdom (<a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). And the language of St. John, "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made" (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), which assigns to the Logos, or Word of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the act of creation (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>, and especially the language of St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), argues in favour of the view of some commentators who understand Wisdom to refer to the Second Person of the Trinity. The Logos was understood by Alexandrian Judaism to express the <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of the unseen God, the Absolute Being, in the creation and government of the world; and the Christian teachers, when they adopted this term, assigned to it a concrete meaning as indicating the Incarnate Word (see Bishop Lightfoot, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). For the passage, see <a href="../../par/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a>; and especially <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, "He hath established the world by his wisdom," etc.; Jeremiah 51:55; Ecclus. 24:2, <span class="accented">seq.

While the primary meaning of <span class="accented">yasad</span> is "to give fixity to," "to lay fast," that of <span class="accented">konen</span>, rendered "he hath established," is "to set up," "to erect," and so "to <span class="accented">found</span>," from <span class="accented">kun</span>, or referring to the Arabic and Ethiopic cognate root, "to exist," "to give existence to." The marginal reading, "prepared," corresponds with the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>.

So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. <span class="accented">The depths</span> (<span class="accented">t'homoth</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">abyssi</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, are here "the internal water stores of the earth" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28</a>, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. <span class="accented">Are broken up</span> (<span class="accented">niv'kau</span>); properly, <span class="accented">were broken up</span>, niph. perfect of <span class="accented">baka</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to cleave asunder, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to break forth, as water, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect.

There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. <span class="accented">The clouds</span> (<span class="accented">sh'khakim</span>) are properly the <span class="accented">ether</span>, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then "the clouds," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular <span class="accented">shakhak</span> signifies "dust," and. secondly "a cloud," evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. <span class="accented">Drop down</span> (<span class="accented">yir'aphu</span>, kal future of <span class="accented">raaph</span>, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "let flow." The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again "to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="accented">Dew</span>; <span class="accented">tal</span>, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers.

Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, "His heavens shall drop down dew" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. <a href="../../par/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a>).

Since Wisdom is so powerful, then, the teacher argues, she is worthy of being retained and guarded, and able to protect. <span class="accented">Let them not depart</span> (<span class="accented">al-yaluzu</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let them not escape or slip aside from your mind (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">effluant haec ab oculis ruts</span>). They are to be as frontiers between your eyes, as a ring upon your finger. <span class="accented">Yaluzu</span>, from <span class="accented">luz</span>, "to bend aside," <span class="accented">defiectere, a via declinare</span>, which see in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, ought probably to be written <span class="accented">yellezu</span>, on the analogy of the corresponding passage in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>. The LXX. renders absolutely <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "do not thou pass by," from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "to flow by," "to pass by, recede" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>, "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to these things, lest at any time we should let them slip (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)," quoted probably from the LXX. of this passage). The Targum Jonathan reads <span class="accented">ne vilescat</span>, "let it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom, "not become worthless." <span class="accented">Them</span>, included in the verb <span class="accented">yaluzu</span> of which it is subject in the original, is to be referred either to "sound wisdom and discretion" of ver. 21b - so Gejerus, Cartwright, Geier, Umbreit, Hitzig, Zockter, Plumptre (a similar trajection occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, and is used, as here, to give vividness to the description): or to "wisdom, understanding, knowledge," of the preceding verses - so Delitzsch and Holden. The first view in every way seems preferable, and it is no objection to it that "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>) and "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'yimmah</span>) are feminine, while the verb "depart" (<span class="accented">yaluzu</span>) is masculine (see Gesenius, *Gram.,' &sect; 147). The Syriac reads, "Let it not become worthless (<span class="accented">ne vile fit</span>) in thine eyes to keep my doctrine and my counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Keep sound wisdom and discretion.</span> <span class="accented">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">n'zor</span>, kal imperative of <span class="accented">natsar</span>, "to watch, guard." For "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>), see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>. Here used for "wisdom" (<span class="accented">kokhmah</span>), as "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>) for "understanding" (<span class="accented">t'vunah</span>), to contrast the absolute wisdom and insight of God with the corresponding attributes in man (see Zockler, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They belong to God, but are conferred on those who seek after Wisdom, and are then to be guarded as priceless treasures. The Vulgate reads, <span class="accented">custodi legem et consilium</span>; and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">g</span>uard my counsel and thought." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall they he life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">So shall they be</span> (<span class="accented">n'yikva</span>); <span class="accented">and they shall be.</span> The "soul" and "neck" stand for the whole man in his twofold nature, internal and external. Life is in its highest and widest sense given to the soul (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-22.htm">Proverbs 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>), and favour is conferred on the man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he becomes acceptable to his neighbours, if he has wisdom. The latter expression is very similar to <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, where the same promise is expressed, "grace" (<span class="accented">hon</span>) being equivalent to "ornament of grace" (<span class="accented">liv'yath hon</span>). Others understand "grace to thy neck" (<span class="accented">hon l'garg</span> <span class="accented">grotheyka</span>), as <span class="accented">gratia guttturis</span>, in the sense of "grace of the lips," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-11.htm">Proverbs 22:11</a>, that is, as the grace of speaking, power of eloquent and effective utterance (Gejerus, Bayne, Lapide). It is better to take it as referring to the adornment of the personal character, and so by metonymy of the favour and kindness which it procures. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall thou walk in thy way safely.</span> The first of the promises of protection, which follow from vers. 23-26. He who keeps "sound wisdom and discretion" shall enjoy the greatest sense of security in all situations of life. <span class="accented">Safely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetakh</span>); either in confidence, as Vulgate <span class="accented">fiducialiter, i.e.</span> confidently, because of the sense of security (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>, and ver. 26); or in security: the adverb <span class="accented">lavetakh</span> is equivalent to <span class="accented">betakh</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a> and Proverbs 10:9. The allusion is obvious. As he who is accompanied by an escort proceeds on his way in safety, so you protected by God will pass your life in security; or, as Trapp, "Thou shalt ever go under a double guard, 'the peace of God' within thee (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>), and the 'power of God' without thee (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">And thy foot shall not stumble;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and thou shall not strike thy foot. Stumble</span> in the original is <span class="accented">thiggoph</span>, 2 singular kal future of <span class="accented">nagaph</span>, "to smite, .... strike against with the foot." So in <a href="../../par/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>. The Authorized Version, however, correctly gives the sense. The LXX., like the Authorized Version, makes "foot" the subject, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;</span>, "(That) thy foot may not stumble." For a similar assurance, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>. The meaning is: You will not stumble, because you will be walking in the way of wisdom, which is free from stumbling blocks (Lapide). You will not fall into sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a></div><div class="verse">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid.</span> This is beautifully illustrated by what David says in <a href="../../par/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, "I will both lay me down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety." No fear is to be apprehended where Jehovah is Protector (see <a href="../../par/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5-8</a>). <span class="accented">When</span>, (<span class="accented">im</span>) is rendered "if" by the Vulgate, LXX., Targum Jonathan. <span class="accented">Thou liest down</span>; <span class="accented">tish'kav</span>, "thou shalt lie down," kal future,  like <span class="accented">shakavta</span>, kal perfect, in the corresponding hemistich, is from <span class="accented">shakav</span>, "to lie down," specially to lay one's self down to sleep, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>. Vulgate, <span class="accented">si dormieris</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, "when thou sleepest" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="accented">b'shok'b'ka</span>). The LXX. rendering, "if thou sittest" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>), arises from reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">teshev</span>) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">tish'kav</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Yea, thou shalt lie down;</span> <span class="accented">b'shok'b'ta</span>, as before, with] prefixed, equivalent to the future, as in the Authorized Version; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be sweet</span>; <span class="accented">arvah</span>, from <span class="accented">arav</span>, "to be sweet," or "pleasant," perhaps "well mixed," as <span class="accented">arev</span>, equivalent to "to mix."

The desolation of the wicked (<span class="accented">shoath r'shaim</span>) may be taken either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as the desolation made by the violence of the wicked, the desolation or strum which they raise against the righteous (so the LXX., Vulgate, Mariana, Michaelis, Hitzig, and others); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the desolation which overtakes the wicked, the desolating vengeance executed upon them (so Doderlein, Lapide, Stuart, Muensch., Delitzsch, Wardlaw). The latter is probably the right interpretation, and agrees with the threatening language of Wisdom against her despisers, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>, where <span class="accented">shdath</span> also occurs. Iu the desolation which shall overwhelm the wicked he who has made Wisdom his guide shall be undismayed, for the Lord is his confidence. The passage was probably suggested by <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>, "Neither shalt thou be afraid of desolation when it cometh." Lee, <span class="accented">in loc. cit.</span>, says the places are almost innumerable where this sentiment occurs.

Kesel</span>, primarily "loin" or "flank," as in <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-14.htm">Leviticus 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>, is apparently used here in its secondary meaning of "confidence," "hope," as in <a href="../../par/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>.

Jehovah shall be in the highest sense your ground and object of confidence. Delitzsch describes <span class="accented">kesel</span> as confidence in the presence of evil: Jehovah in the presence of the "sudden fear," and of "the desolation of the wicked," the evils and calamities which overwhelm the wicked, shall be thy confidence. The sense of his all-encircling protection will render you undismayed. The meaning given to <span class="accented">kesel</span> as "foolhardiness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>) and "folly" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>). and the connection of <span class="accented">kesel</span> with <span class="accented">k'silim</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, comes from the root idea <span class="accented">kasal</span>, "to be fleshly, or fat," the signification of which branches out on the one side into strength and boldness, and on the other into languor and inertness, and so folly or confidence in self (Schultens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>). The Talmudic rendering of the Rabbi Salomon approximates to this meaning, "and the things in which you seemed to be foolish (<span class="accented">desipere videbaris</span>) he will be at once present with you." Others, as Ziegler, Muentinghe, gave <span class="accented">kesel</span> its primary meaning, and translate, "Jehovah shall be as thy loins," the loins being regarded as the emblem of strength. Jehovah shall be your strength. But <span class="accented">kesel</span> does not appear to have this local application here. Wherever it is used in this sense, as in Job and Leviticus cited above, there is something in the context to point it out as a part of the body. Compare, however, the Vulgate. <span class="accented">in latere suo</span>, "in thy side or flank." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "over all thy ways." From being taken (<span class="accented">millaked</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne capiaris</span>, "lest thou be taken." The meaning is, Jehovah will be your protection against all the snares and traps which the impious lay for you. <span class="accented">Leked</span>, "a being taken," is from <span class="accented">lakad</span>, "to take or catch animals" in a net or in snares. It only occurs here in the Proverbs. Its unusual appearance, together with other reasons, not tenable, however, has led Hitzig to reject vers. 22-26 as an interpolation.  The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, pavorem. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, is used subjectively, and means "any vehement emotion."

Authorized Version, "and be not afraid with any amazement;" see also Book of Common Prayer: 'Solemnization of Matrimony,' <span class="accented">ad fin</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a></div><div class="verse">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-35.</span> - 6. <span class="accented">Sixth admonitory discourse.</span> In this discourse the teacher still carries on his object, which is to demonstrate the conditions upon which true wisdom and happiness are to be attained. The discourse differs from the preceding in consisting of detached proverbs, and may be divided into two main sections - the first (vers. 27-30) enjoining benevolence, that love to one's neighbour which is the fulfilling of the Law; the second warning against emulating the oppressor and associating with him, because of the fate of the wicked (vers. 31-35). It is observable that all the maxims have a negative form, and thus present a striking contrast to the form adopted by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>.), and to the admonitions at the close of St. Paul's Epistles. In one instance in particular (ver. 30), the teaching does not reach the high moral standard of the gospel (see Delitzsch and Lange). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due.</span> This precept indicates the general principle of beneficence, and not merely, as the words at first sight seem to imply, restitution (as Cajet.). We are to do good to those who are in need or deserving of it, whenever we have the means and opportunity. <span class="accented">From them to whom it is due</span> (<span class="accented">nib'alayv</span>); literally, <span class="accented">from its owner</span>, from <span class="accented">baal, dominus</span>, "lord" or owner of a thing. Cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-22.htm">Proverbs 16:22</a>, "Prudence is a fountain of life to its owner (<span class="accented">b'alayv</span>);" 1:19; 17:8; and also <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; - in all of which passages proprietorship in the thing or quality mentioned is expressed. The owners of good are those to whom good is due or belongs either by law or by morality, whether by desert or need. The latter qualification is the one emphasized in the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fc6;</span>, "Abstain not from doing good to the needy." So the Arabic <span class="accented">pauperi.</span> The Targum and Syriac put the precept in more general terms, "Cease not to do good," without indicating in particular anyone who is to be the recipient of the good. But the Jewish interpreters generally (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ben Ezra) understand it of the poor, <span class="accented">egentibus.</span> The Vulgate puts an entirely different interpretation on the passage: <span class="accented">Noli prohibere benefacere eum qui potest</span>; <span class="accented">si vales, et ipse benefac</span>, "Do not prohibit him who can from doing good; if you are able, do good also yourself." It thus implies that we are to put no impediment in the way of any one who is willing to do good to others, and enjoins the duty on ourselves also. <span class="accented">Good</span> (<span class="accented">tov</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">good"</span> under any form, any good deed or act of beneficence. The principle brought forward in this passage is that what we possess and is seemingly our own is in reality to be regarded as belonging to others. We are only stewards of our wealth. <span class="cmt_word">In the power of thine hand</span> (<span class="accented">lel yad'yka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the power of thine hands.</span> For the dual, <span class="accented">yad'yka</span>, the Keri substitutes the singular, <span class="accented">yad'ka</span>, to harmonize it with the similar expression, <span class="accented">lel yadi</span>, "in the power of thy hand," which occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. But there is no grammatical need for the emendation. Both the LXX. and Targum employ the singular, "thy hand." <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="accented">el</span>); here "strength" in the abstract. Usually it means "the strong," and is so used as an appellation of Jehovah. though, as Gesenius says, those little understand the phrase who would render <span class="accented">el</span> here "by God." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="accented">el</span> indicates the condition. The meaning of the phrase is, "While it is practicable, and you have the opportunity and means of doing good, do it." Do not defer, but do good promptly. The passage receives a remarkable illustration in the language of St. Paul, "While we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men" (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a></div><div class="verse">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The precept of this and that of the preceding verse are very closely related. The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, "Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today." This "putting off" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thy neighbour;</span> <span class="accented">l'reayka</span>, "to thy friends," the word being evidently used distributively. <span class="accented">Reeh</span> is "a companion" or "friend" (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">amico tuo</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">sodali tuo</span>), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "neighbour." The Authorized Version correctly renders "come again," as <span class="accented">shav</span> is not merely  "to return," but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">revertere</span>; and as the words, "tomorrow I will give thee," show. The LXX. adds, "For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth," probably from <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, "A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour." Seneca says in the same spirit, "Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit," "The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also <span class="accented">Bis dat qui cito dat.</span>

The meaning of this expression lies between "fabricating evil" and "ploughing evil." The radical meaning of <span class="accented">kharash</span>, from which <span class="accented">takharosh</span>, is "to cut into," "to inscribe" letters on a tablet, cognate with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut into." But it is used in the sense of "to plough" in <a href="../../par/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, "They that plough iniquity (<span class="accented">khar'shey aven</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," and <a href="../../par/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, "The ploughers ploughed (<span class="accented">khar'shim khar'shim</span>) upon my back" (cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). This also appears from the context to be the meaning in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. With these we may compare such expressions as "to plough a lie" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version, "Devise not a lie"); see <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>, and "to sow iniquity," <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a> - a cognate figure. "To plough evil" is to devise evil, to prepare for it, just in the same way as a ploughman prepares the land for sowing. In this sense the verb is understood by the older commentators and by Ewald and Delitzsch. On the other hand, the verb may be used in its other signification, "to fabricate," and hence "to contrive." The noun <span class="accented">kharash</span> is an artificer of iron, etc. (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>). "To fabricate evil" is, of course, as the Authorized Version "to devise evil." The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc4;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to build," inclines to this sense. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne moliaris</span>, does not clear up the point, though <span class="accented">moliri</span>, usually "to contrive," is used by Virgil, 'Georg.,' 1:494, "moliri terrain," of working or tilling the ground. The verb also occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-20.htm">Proverbs 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cure ille in te habet fiduciam</span>, "when he has confidence in thee;" so the LXX.; or, as the Targum and Syriac, "when he dwells with thee in peace." <span class="accented">To dwell</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>) is in <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "to sit with any one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to associate familiarly with him (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4, 5</a>); but it also has the meaning , "to dwell," and the participle <span class="accented">yoshev</span>, here used; in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>: <a href="../../par/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>, means "an inhabitant, a dweller." <span class="accented">Securely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full trust (see on ver. 23). Devising evil against a friend is at any time reprehensible, but to do so when he confides in and is altogether unsuspicious of you, is an act of the greatest treachery, and an outrage on all law. human and Divine. It implies dissimulation. It is the very sin by which "the devil beguiled Eve through his subtlety" (Wardlaw).

They "glory in their shame" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>); or shame renders them conspicuous as warning examples (Ewald); or, as Dathe explains it, "Stulti infamia sunt famosi," "Fools become famous by infamy;" or as Rabbi Levi, "Shame exalts them as into the air, and makes them vanish away." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Fools exalt shame, prize what others despise" (Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Umbreit, Bertheau, Zockler, render, "Shame sweeps fools away," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lifts them up in order to sweep away and destroy them (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The true rendering seems to be given by Michaelis, "Fools carry away shame" as their portion. So the Targum, Delitzsch, Hitzig, Wordsworth. They look for "promotion." They attain such as it is, but the end of their attainments is "shame and everlasting contempt." As the wise inherit glory, so fools get as their portion shame and ignominy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/4.htm"><title>Proverbs 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/3.htm" title="Proverbs 3">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 4 <a href="../proverbs/5.htm" title="Proverbs 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-27.</span> - 7. <span class="accented">Seventh admonitory discourse.</span> We here enter upon the second group of admonitory discourses, as is indicated by the opening address, "my children," and which occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-7.htm">Proverbs 5:7</a> and Proverbs 7:24. This group extends to the end of ch. 7. Its prevailing tone is that of warning rather than of positive exhortations, which have been the rule hitherto. The general aim of the discourse before us, as of those preceding, is to exalt Wisdom, to exhibit her as a subject worthy of all earnest endeavour and sacrifice, but it is noticeable that the teacher introduces a fresh feature into his teaching or mode of instruction, in order to procure attention to, and acceptance of, his precepts on the part of his hearers. He has already spoken in his own name and with his own authority; he has brought forward Wisdom personified as making her appeal; he now adduces the authority of his own father's advice to himself. But as the mode of emphasizing his admonitions varies, so Wisdom is many-sided, and the aspect under which she is now presented seems to be especially that of discipline and obedience. The keynote of the discourse seems to be struck in the word "instruction," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> discipline, in the original, <span class="accented">musar</span>, thus recalling the admonition in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, "My son, hear the instruction of thy father." Bohlius, in his 'Ethica Sacra,' disp. 6. p. 65, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, assigns "discipline" (<span class="accented">musar</span>) to this chapter; and Melancthon describes the admonitions of the chapter before us as "adhortationes ad studium obedientiae." Discipline rising into obedience seems to be the predominant thought to which all others are made subordinate. The discourse is an enlargement or amplification of this aspect of Wisdom. In structure the discourse consists mainly of the father's advice (vers. 4-19), preceded and followed by the teacher's own admonitions in vers. 1-3 and 20-27. The chief topics touched upon are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the supreme importance of Wisdom as being "the principal thing" to be obtained before everything else (vers. 7-9); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the two ways that lie open to the choice of youth, distinguished respectively as the way of light and the way of darkness (vers. 14-19); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the guarding of the heart with all diligence, as being the seat of conscience and the fountain of life in its moral sense (vers. 23-27). The first part of the discourse is characterized by exhortations accompanied by promises; the latter part takes the form of warning, and warning of an alarming nature. The harmony which exists between the allusions in the discourse and the facts recorded in the historical books of Samuel and Chronicles serves to indicate that we have before us, in substance at least, the advice which David gave to  Solomon, and that the discourse is Solomonic. Compare especially ver. 3 with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a> and 1 Chron 22:9, and ver. 18 with the last words of David in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father.</span> This exhortation is identical with that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, except that the address, "ye children," indicating a new departure, is now used instead of "my son," which has been hitherto employed (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 21</a>), and "of thy father" is altered to "of a father." The verb is the same, occurring here, of course, in the plural number. The appeal is evidently intended to rouse attention. Attention is especially necessary to secure a knowledge of Divine truth. <span class="accented">Ye children</span> (<span class="accented">bhanim</span>). This address occurs again twice in the second group of admonitory discourses - in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-7.htm">Proverbs 5:7</a> and Proverbs 7:24, and also in the appeal of Wisdom personified in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-32.htm">Proverbs 8:32</a>, and, with these exceptions, nowhere else in the Proverbs. It is used by David, and it is possible that when the teacher penned these words he had in mind <a href="../../par/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>, "Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord." The similarity in the address serves to connect the teacher of wisdom with David, and thus to identify him with Solomon, while it also leads to the conclusion that the advice which follows in vers. 4-19 is in substance that which David had given his son. On "instruction," see ch. 1:8. <span class="accented">Of a father</span> (<span class="accented">av</span>). It is difficult, owing to the want of the pronominal suffix, to determine accurately whether the teacher is referring to himself or to his own father in the expression. The following verse <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> would indicate that he is speaking of <span class="accented">himself</span> in his capacity as a teacher or instructor of youth. But it is quite possible that he may be referring to <span class="accented">his own father</span>, whose advice he had received, and which he is now about to lay before others in vers. 4-19. Though attention to paternal advice in general, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> instruction given by any father to his children, is not intended here, still the passage may be regarded as embodying the principle that attention to parental advice is incumbent on children, and a disregard of it is the mark of ingratitude and depravity. Rabbi Levi understands the phrase as referring to our heavenly Father. <span class="cmt_word">Attend</span> (<span class="accented">hakshivu</span>, hiph. imperative of <span class="accented">kashav</span>). On the force of this verb as signifying "earnest, absorbed attention," see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To know understanding</span> (<span class="accented">ladaath bina</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order that you may know or gain understanding. "The infinitive marks the design or object of the attention (cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut sciatis</span>). `The expression corresponds with <span class="accented">ladaath khokmah</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, and just as this signifies "to appropriate to yourself wisdom," so the one before us has the same force, and signifies the gaining or appropriation of understanding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the faculty of discernment or discrimination. Hitzig renders, "to know with the understanding;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to know intelligently, but this does not seem to be the meaning of the phrase. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-2.htm">Proverbs 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I give you good doctrine.</span> This, while stating the reason for the exhortation in the previous verse, signifies that what the teacher has given and is giving, he has received from his father. <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">give</span>; <span class="accented">nathati</span>, literally, "I gave," is the kal perfect of <span class="accented">nathan</span>, "to give," but the perfect is here used for the present, as denoting not only a past action, but one that is still continuing (Gesenius, 'Hebrews Gram.,' &sect; 126. 3). <span class="accented">Good doctrine</span> (<span class="accented">lekakh tov</span>). The doctrine or instruction is "good," not only intrinsically, but as to the source from which it was derived, and in its effects. <span class="accented">Lekakh</span> is, according to its root <span class="accented">lakakh</span>, "something which is received or taken." From the standpoint of the teacher it is that instruction which he had received of his father. With respect to his hearers it is the instruction which is communicated to them, and which they receive (see on Proverbs 1:5). The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>; similarly the Vulgate, <span class="accented">donum bonum</span>, "a good gift." <span class="cmt_word">Forsake ye not;</span> <span class="accented">al-taazovu</span>, from <span class="accented">azav</span>, "to leave, forsake" (compare the corresponding phrase, <span class="accented">al-tiltosh</span>, from <span class="accented">natash</span>, "to leave, forsake," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Law</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>); as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I was my father's son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I was my father's son.</span> This is more than the mere statement of a physical fact. It indicates that the teacher was in the highest degree an object of endearment to his father, just as he states in the second hemistich that he held a unique position in the affection of his mother. `The statement agrees with the historical record. Solomon would be more than ordinarily dear to his father, as being a child of promise, as "the beloved of the Lord," and as the son whom the Divine will had pointed as the successor to his throne, and the one on whom was to devolve the building of the temple (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). Bertheau explains, "I also once stood in the relation to my (actual) father in which you stand to me your paternal instructor," thus giving prominence rather to the consecution of the passage, and preparing the way for the reception of the father's advice which is to follow. But this rather loses sight of what appears an important element in the instruction, that not only was it "good," but that it was dictated by affection. The writer is fortifying and strengthening his instruction by the authority of his father, showing that what he was laying before others he had had placed before him; and  as <span class="accented">his</span> father's advice was the outcome of affection, so he addresses his hearers in the same spirit. Dathe and others connect "tender" <span class="accented">rak</span>) with "son" (<span class="accented">ben</span>), and render, "I was a son dear to my father." So the LXX., which, however, understands "tender" in the sense of "tractable," "obedient:" "For I was an obedient son to my father" - a meaning which the word <span class="accented">rak</span> can only bear as indicating the susceptibility of the young to receive impressions. In general, <span class="accented">rak</span> means "tender," "soft," and has reference to the weakness and helplessness of the young; comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>, "My lord knoweth that the children are tender (<span class="accented">rakkim</span>)." Combined with <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, which follows, it signifies, in the passage before us, that the teacher was an object of tender care or love. The Vulgate <span class="accented">tenellus</span>, the diminutive of <span class="accented">tener</span>, as signifying "somewhat tender or delicate," reproduces the idea of the Hebrew <span class="accented">rak.</span> In the word the teacher recalls his early lifo and the instruction in wisdom which he received in it. <span class="cmt_word">Only beloved;</span> literally, <span class="accented">only</span> (<span class="accented">yakhid</span>), as "beloved" does not occur in the original. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>; Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "only begotten:" but this was not literally the fact, as Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, had other sons (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>). Both the Hebrew <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, "only," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>, "only begotten," consequently signify what is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "beloved." Solomon was so beloved of his mother as if he were an only child. So <span class="accented">yakhid</span> is used of Isaac in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12</a> in the same way, since at the time that Isaac was so designated, Ishmael, the other son of Abraham, was still living. The word <span class="accented">yakhid</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, where it is rendered "darling," and may possibly refer to Solomon. Jennings, in <a href="../../par/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, understands it, however, of the life besides which the psalmist has no other - <span class="accented">unicam meam, as</span> the Vulgate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his only life" (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>; and for the word <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of my mother</span> (<span class="accented">liph'ne immi</span>); literally, <span class="accented">ad facies matris meae</span>, or, <span class="accented">before my mother</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">coram matre mea, i.e.</span> in her estimation (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>). The mention of the mother is probably introduced here for the sake of poetic parallelism; cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a> (Zockler). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-4.htm">Proverbs 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - From this verse to ver. 19 inclusive, the teacher quotes the instruction which he had received of his father. His object in doing so is to show that his own teaching was in harmony with it, and therefore worthy of attention. His precepts, admonitions, and warnings are not his only, but those of his father. Other examples of David's instructions to Solomon are found in <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he taught;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his father, for <span class="accented">vayyoreni</span> is masculine. The LXX. renders, "They said and taught me (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>)," as if the precepts which follow were the combined teaching of David and Bathsheba. This variation is due to the mention of both parents in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Retain</span>; <span class="accented">yith'mok</span>, kal future, used imperatively, of <span class="accented">thamak</span>, "to take hold of," and metaphorically, as here, "to hold fast" (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>). The LXX. Renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, imperative of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to fix firm." Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "give heed to." <span class="cmt_word">And live;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and thou shalt live, as the kal imperative, <span class="accented">kh'yeh</span>, from <span class="accented">khayah</span>, "to live," has here the force of the future (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">et vives</span>). The meaning is, "And thou shalt enjoy a long and happy life." Temporal life alone seems to be indicated, as in ver. 10 (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>). The Syriac addition, "And my law as the apple of thine eye," is probably borrowed from <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>, where we meet with the mine admonition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - After the general exhortation given above, the father's instruction becomes more specific, and deals with the acquirement of wisdom. This subject seems to be continued in ver. 13, where the second and concluding branch of the instruction begins, which consists mainly of warning, as the first part does with exhortation. We are thus furnished with an example how to teach. In our teaching it is not sufficient simply to point out what is to be done, but we must show what is to be avoided. <span class="cmt_word">Get wisdom, get understanding</span>. The father urges the acquirement of wisdom in the same way and with the same importunity as the trader or merchant presses his goods upon buyers. Wisdom and understanding are put forward as objects of merchandise; for the verb <span class="accented">kanah</span>, from which the imperative <span class="accented">k'neh</span>, signifies not only "to acquire for one's self," or "to possess," but especially "to buy." The verb occurs again in the same sense in ver. 7, "Get [<span class="accented">k'neh, i.e.</span> buy] wisdom;" and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>, "Buy (<span class="accented">k'neh</span>) the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding" (cf. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>: 16:16; 19:9, where we also meet with the same verb). The reiteration of the word "get," as Umbreit remarks, is "an imitation of the exclamation of a merchant who is offering his wares." The importunity of the father measures the value he sets upon wisdom as an inestimable treasure, a pearl of great price (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Forget it not,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">forget not, neither turn from the words of my mouth</span>, - so Zockler, Delitzsch, Hodg., and others; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne obliviscaris, neque declines a verbis oris mei.</span> There is no  need to supply "it" after the verb <span class="accented">al-tish'-kakh</span>, "forget not," as Holden states, and as appears in the Authorized Version, since <span class="accented">shakakh is</span> found with <span class="accented">min</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>), "of" or "from," in <a href="../../par/psalms/12-4.htm">Psalm 12:4</a> (5), "I forgot to eat (<span class="accented">shakakh'ti meakol</span>)," and the same construction may obtain here. The two verbs, "forget" and "decline from," are not so very wide in meaning, since the former, <span class="accented">shakakh</span>, is to "leave" something from forgetfulness, and the latter, <span class="accented">natah</span>, rendered here "decline from," is "to turn away" from something. <span class="cmt_word">The words of my mouth</span> represent as it were the means by which wisdom may be purchased.

(the verse is omitted by the Vatican LXX.), Targum, and Syriac, agree in rendering this verse, "The beginning of wisdom is get wisdom," which is equivalent to saying that the beginning of wisdom consists in the acquisition of wisdom, or, as Umbreit explains, "in the resolution to get wisdom." That this rendering, which is adopted by Luther, Delitzsch, and Umbreit, may be correct appears from <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, where we have the same construction, only in inverted order. Seneca's aphorism is conceived in much the same spirit: "Magna pars boni est velle fieri bonum" - "A large part of good is the wish to become good;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the beginning of being good depends to a large extent upon the wish to become so. The objections to this rendering are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is difficult to see how the beginning of wisdom can be the acquisition of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That elsewhere, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, the beginning of wisdom is represented as the fear of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it does not fall in well with the context or with the aim of the father's teaching, which is to hold up wisdom as pre-eminently a blessing, as the most excellent and highest thing attainable. On the other hand, Hitzig, De Dieu, Doderlein, Zockler, render as in the Authorized Version, "Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom is the highest good, and therefore ought to be obtained. The word <span class="accented">reshith</span> is found with this signification in ch. 24:20; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And with all thy getting get understanding</span>. This does not mean, as the Authorized Version seems to imply, that while you are acquiring other things, you are to acquire wisdom, but that wisdom is to be purchased with all you have acquired or gotten. "Getting" (<span class="accented">kin'yon</span>) is the purchase money. No price is too high to be paid for her, no sacrifice too great; cf. the parables of the hidden treasure and goodly pearl (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>: <a href="../../par/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>), in both of which the man sold "all that he had" to obtain the prize. There is a play upon the words in the original (<span class="accented">kin'yan'ki k'neh</span>), which is preserved in our translation.

It is equivalent to the kal form. The pilpel form only occurs here, but the kal participle is met with in <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a>, where it has the meaning of "to raise up as a causeway" (see marginal reading <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Gesenius renders, "exalt her," <span class="accented">sc.</span> with praises. The meaning of the verb, as Delitzsch says, is to be determined, by the corresponding "she shall promote thee" (<span class="accented">th'rom'mek</span>), and this verb <span class="accented">romem</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to raise or make high; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to exalt by bestowing honours upon one of low estate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> raising them in general estimation; it is so used in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a> by Hannah, in her song of thankfulness, "He (Jehovah) bringeth low and lifteth up (<span class="accented">m'romem</span>);" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to extol by praises, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>. The radical meaning of <span class="accented">salal</span> seems to be "to heap up," as a road is prepared by embankments, and by the filling up of inequalities (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In this sense the passage before us is explained by Levi ben Gersom, "Prepare the way of Wisdom, and walk assiduously in it." But the context, wherein the idea of buying is evidently used. favours Bottcher's interpretation, "Hold it or her high in price, bid high for her as a purchaser who makes offer upon offer, to secure what he wants." So Pi, <span class="accented">in pretio habe.</span> The LXX. rendering, "Circumvallate her, enclose her with a wall or hedge," which is reproduced in the Arabic, <span class="accented">circumsepi eam</span>, "hedge her around," seems out of place with the context. The Talmudists understand the verb as signifying "to examine closely," "to scrutinize, meditate, or reflect" upon Wisdom constantly, just as the Roman, poet says, "Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna" - "We exalt Wisdom when we follow her precepts," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when we esteem her - the idea which is presented to us in the Targum and Syriac cited above. The sentiment of the verse agrees with what Jehovah says in the message of the man of God to Eli, in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, "Them that honour me I will honour." <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</span> The LXX. reverses the order of ideas, "Honour her in order that she may embrace thee." <span class="accented">Embrace her</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a loving and affectionate manner, as a husband does his wife, or a son his mother. (For the verb <span class="accented">khavak</span>, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>: <a href="../../par/songs/2-6.htm">Song of Solomon 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/8-3.htm">Song of Solomon 8:3</a>.) There are only three  other instances where this verb occurs in the pilel form, <span class="accented">khibbek.</span> Esteem and honour, the confidence of others, elevation to offices of trust and consequence, are some of the rewards with which Wisdom repays those who esteem and love her. Others follow in the next verse.

That this is the meaning is clear from the corresponding "she shall give" (<span class="accented">titten</span>, but cf. <span class="accented">nathan</span>, "to give"). It is commonly found with an accusative and dative, but here takes two accusatives. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, "With a crown of glory or delights shall she protect (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">proteget</span>) thee:" as if it were connected with <span class="accented">magen</span>, "a shield," but a crown is not usually associated with protection or defence. "A crown of glory," in the New Testament, is always associated with the everlasting honours of heaven, as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>.

He who shows a delighter willingness in admitting the words of Wisdom - for such a character the father claims for his teaching, as we see from, the next verse - shall receive a blessing. It is a sign of grace when any even show themselves open to listen to instruction; but it is a greater sign when this instruction is received with readiness and pleasure (Muffet). <span class="cmt_word">The years of thy life</span> (<span class="accented">sh'noth khayyim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">years of thy lives.</span> The plural "lives" expresses the idea of life in the abstract.

The father recalls the instruction which he has given in times past. So Delitzsch. But Gejerus gives them the combined force of the past and future, "I have taught and I will more fully teach," and so with the other verb. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">monstrabo</span>, "I will show," and <span class="accented">ducam</span>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will lead." <span class="cmt_word">In the way of wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'derek khok'mah</span>) may mean "in the way that leads <span class="accented">to</span>, or by which you come to Wisdom; I have taught you the manner in which Wisdom may be attained;" or "the way in which Wisdom walks" (Zockler). The ways of Wisdom are described in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-17.htm">Proverbs 3:17</a> as "<span class="accented">ways</span> of pleasantness." The next clause seems to indicate that the latter explanation is to be preferred. The (<span class="accented">b</span>) indicates the subject in which instruction has been given. <span class="cmt_word">In right paths</span> (<span class="accented">b'ma'g'le yosher</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the paths of rectitude</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of straightness, paths of which the characteristic is uprightness.

The whole course of life shall be freed from obstacles or impediments, from anxiety, perplexity, or difficulty, or from vacillation. <span class="cmt_word">When thou goest</span> may refer to the daily walk, to the common and ordinary events or circumstances incidental to life, just as the corresponding <span class="cmt_word">when thou runnest</span> may refer to cases of emergency when promptness and decisive action are called for. In both cases Wisdom, by inspiring unity of principle, gives freedom of movement; in ordinary cases it removes embarrassment and perplexity arising from conflicting interests drawing now in one direction, now in another, and in extraordinary cases it supplies a rule of conduct which prevents our falling into mistakes and errors. Or the verse may refer to the prosperity which shall attend all the undertakings of those who are in Wisdom's ways, whether they advance slowly or rush forward with the impetuosity of youth, whether they act with deliberation or with haste. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be straitened</span> (<span class="accented">lo-yetsar</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall not be narrowed or confined; Vulgate, <span class="accented">non arctabuntur</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, The future <span class="accented">yetsar</span> only occurs four times in the Scriptures - here, and <a href="../../par/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>. It is usually derived from the root <span class="accented">yatsar</span>, which, however, is not found, cognate with <span class="accented">tsur</span>, "to straiten," "to be narrow." <span class="accented">Yetsar</span>, however, always occurs in the  passive sense, though an active signification is given it by the Rabbi Nathan ben Jechiel, quoted by Delitzsch, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, who renders, "Thou shall not need to bind together, or hedge up thy way." The roots <span class="accented">yatsar</span> and <span class="accented">tsur</span> partake more or less of the idea of binding up, oppressing, putting into narrow and confined circumstances and limits. By the expression that "the steps are straitened" we may understand, therefore, that there is a want of freedom for their movements, and consequently that they are impeded or cramped. The Arabic expression. "to contract the feet," signifies the diminishing of good fortune. Compare the similar expression in <a href="../../par/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, "The steps of his strength shall be straitened." The psalmist presents the idea of the verse under a different form, "Thou hast <span class="accented">enlarged</span> my steps under me, so that my feet did not slip" (Psalm 17:36). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not stumble;</span> <span class="accented">lo-thik-kashel</span>, hiph. future. The niph. <span class="accented">nikshal</span>, equivalent to the kal <span class="accented">kadshal</span>, signifies properly "to totter," "to sink down," used of one about to fall. The primary idea, however, usually disregarded, of <span class="accented">kashal</span>, is "to totter in the ankles," equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">talipedare.</span> It occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, and is a different verb from "stumble" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a> (which see).

This latter conviction is the reason why he urges "taking fast hold" of Wisdom. The tenacious grasp with which the shipwrecked sinking sailor lays hold on any spar or plank floating near will illustrate the kind of grasp with which Wisdom is to be held. It is no less a virtue to keep and hold fast a good thing than to get it at the first beginning (Muffet). <span class="cmt_word">Instruction</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), usually of a disciplinary nature (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>), here more particularly the instruction of the father, but in a wider sense wisdom generally, with which it is synonymous, as appears from the feminine, "let <span class="accented">her</span> not go, keep <span class="accented">her</span>," <span class="accented">musar</span> being masculine; or the feminines may refer back to "Wisdom" in ver. 11. So Mercerus and Buxtorf. <span class="cmt_word">For she is thy life</span> (<span class="accented">ki hi khayyeka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she brings life to thee. Wisdom is represented as the bestower of long life, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16, 18</a>. Just in proportion as Wisdom is retained and guarded, so is life secured, and so far as the hold upon her is lost, so are the hopes of life diminished.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - From admonition the father passes to warning. The connection with the preceding section is obvious. There are two ways diametrically opposite - the way of wisdom and the way of evil; the one the way of life, the other fraught with death, because a way of darkness and violence. As the father has dealt with the former, so now he deals with the latter. With these warnings we may also comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a> and Proverbs 2:10-15, where much the same warning is given, and the way of the wicked is described in almost the same terms. The warning of the father takes a threefold form: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> enter not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> go not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> avoid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In effect he says this is the only course to be adopted in order to keep a firm hold of Wisdom which he has counselled in the preceding verse (13). <span class="cmt_word">Enter not;</span> <span class="accented">al-tavo</span>, from <span class="accented">bo</span>. "to come in," "to enter," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not even enter. The Vulgate renders, "Delight not in," evidently from reading <span class="accented">tove</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>. But our reading is to be preferred, as <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to acquiesce in," from which <span class="accented">tov'e</span>, is not used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;</span>, here denoting place, but with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;</span>. Go not (<span class="accented">al-t'ashsher</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not walk in. The two verbs "to enter" (<span class="accented">bo</span>) and "to go" (<span class="accented">ishsher</span>) stand in the relation of <span class="accented">entering</span> and <span class="accented">going on</span> - <span class="accented">ingressus</span> and <span class="accented">progressus.</span> So Gejerus and Delitzsch. The piel <span class="accented">ishsher</span>, here used, is properly "to go straight on," like the kal <span class="accented">ashar</span>, of which it is an intensive (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>). It is the bold, presumptuous walk, the stepping straight out of the evil, which is here indicated, and against this the father warns his son. The sense is, "If you have entered the way of the wicked, do not continue or persevere in it." The other meanings of the verb <span class="accented">ashar</span>, viz. "to guide straight" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-19.htm">Proverbs 23:19</a>), "to esteem happy and prosperous" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>), are not in place here, as they destroy the parallelism of thought, and on the same ground the LXX. and Syriac renderings, "envy not" and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, are to be rejected. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked</span> (<span class="accented">ishaim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the godless (cf, <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>), is parallel with "evil men" (<span class="accented">raim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the habitually wicked.

The injunction, so absolutely stated, to have nothing to do with sin, is required, if not indeed prompted, by the knowledge of the fact that youth, confident in its own power of resistance, frequently indulges in the fatal mistake of imagining that it can dally with sin with impunity. The only course compatible with safety is to entirely avoid it.

Sin has become to them a kind of second nature, and, unless they indulge in it, sleep is banished from their eyes. <span class="cmt_word">They sleep not;</span> <span class="accented">lo-yish'nu</span>, future of <span class="accented">yashan</span>, "to fall asleep;" the future here being used for the present, as is frequently the case in the Proverbs, and denoting a permanent condition or habit. <span class="cmt_word">Unless they cause some to fall;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "unless they have betrayed others into sin," taking the verb in an ethical sense (Zockler), or, which is preferable, owing to ver. 16<span class="accented">a</span>, unless they have done them some injury (Mercerus); Vulgate, <span class="accented">nisi supplantaverint.</span> For the Khetib <span class="accented">yik'shulu</span>, kal, which would mean "unless they have stumbled or fallen," the Keri substitutes the hiph. <span class="accented">yak'shihi</span> "unless they have caused some to fall." The hiph. is found without any object, as here, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-8.htm">2 Chronicles 25:8</a>). (On the verb <span class="accented">khasal</span>, from which it is derived, see ch. 4:12.) With the statement of the verse we may compare David's complaint of the persistent persecution of his enemies (<a href="../../par/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>), "If they be not satisfied, then will they stay all night" (margin). A similar construction to the one before us occurs in Virgil: "Et si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses" - "And had you not, by some means or other done him an injury, you would have died" ('Eclog.,' 3:15); cf. also Juvenal: "Ergo non aliter poterit dormire; quibusdam somnum rixa facit" - "Therefore, not otherwise, would he have slept; contention to some produces sleep." Hitzig rejects vers. 16 and 17 against all manuscript authority. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) is here explanatory. It serves not so much to introduce another independent statement, as one which accounts for the statement made in the preceding verse, that the wicked sleep not unless they have done mischief, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it states the reason why they are so conditioned. There is no comparison expressed in the original, as the rendering adopted by Schultens and others implies, "For wickedness do they eat as bread, and violence do they drink as wine," which is evidently based on <a href="../../par/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>, "Which drinketh up iniquity like water," and <a href="../../par/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>, "Who drinketh up scorning like water." The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">for they eat the bread of wickedness, and the wine of violence do they drink. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The bread of wickedness</span> (<span class="accented">lekhem resha</span>) is not bread which consists in wickedness, but bread which is obtained by wickedness, just as the wine of violence (<span class="accented">yiyin khamasim</span>) is not the wine which produces violence, but the wine that is procured by violent dee,is. Their support, what they eat and drink, is obtained by wickedness and injustice. They live by wrong. For such expressions as "the bread of wickedness" and "the wine of violence," cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>, "the bread of affliction;" <a href="../../par/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, "the bread of sorrows;" and <a href="../../par/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>, "the wine of the condemned." There is a charade of tense in the verbs, the first being perfect, "they have eaten," and the second future, "they shall drink," which Delitzsch explains as representing the twofold act - first eating the bread, and then washing it down with wine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - A contrast is drawn in this and the following verse between the path of the just and the way of the wicked. The former is, by an extremely beautiful image, likened to the light at dawn, which goes on increasing in brightness and intensity as the day advances, until at length it reaches its meridian splendour and glory. An exactly similar figure is found in David's last words (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The path of the just;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their moral course. <span class="cmt_word">As the shining light</span> (<span class="accented">k'or nogah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the light of dawn. The word <span class="accented">nogah</span>, from <span class="accented">nagah</span>, "to shine," is a noun, and properly signifies "brightness," "shining." "splendour." It is used also to designate the dawn, the light of the sun when it first mounts the horizon, and sheds its beams over the landscape, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>, "Kings (shall come) to the brightness (<span class="accented">nogah</span>) of thy rising;" and <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, "Until the righteousness thereof go forth as the brightness (<span class="accented">nogah</span>)" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>, where the same word also occurs). Michaelis and Schultens refer <span class="accented">nogah</span> to "the path," and render, "The path of the just is splendid as the light." So Dathe and others; and in this sense it was understood by the LXX., "The path of the just shall shine as the light shines." The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">quasi lux splendens. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That shineth more and more</span> (<span class="accented">holek vaor</span>); literally, <span class="accented">going and shining</span> - a common Hebrew idiom denoting progression or increase. The construction of the participle <span class="accented">holek</span>, from <span class="accented">halak</span>, "to go," with the  participle of another verb, is found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-41.htm">1 Samuel 17:41</a>, "The Philistine came nearer and nearer (<span class="accented">holek v'karev</span>);" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>. "The child Samuel grew on more and more (<span class="accented">holek v'hadel</span>)" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the perfect day</span> (<span class="accented">ad-n'kon hayyom</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">usque ad perfectam diem.</span> The Hebrew, <span class="accented">n'kon hayyom</span>, corresponds to the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, equivalent to "the high noon," when the sun seems <span class="accented">to stand still</span> in the heavens. The figure, as Fleiseher remarks, is probably derived from the balance, the tongue of the balance of day, which before or after is inclined either to the right or the left, being at midday perfectly upright, and as it were firm. So <span class="accented">kun</span>, the unused kal, from which <span class="accented">n'kon</span>, the niph. participle, is derived, is "to stand upright," and in hiph. "to be set," "to stand firm," "to be established," and hence the expression might be rendered, "until the steady, or established day," which, however, refers to the midday, or noon, and not to that point when day succeeds dawn, as Rosenmuller and Schultens on <a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> maintain. The comparison is not extended beyond the midday, because the wish of the father was to indicate the full knowledge which the just attain in God, and which can knew of no decline. A similar figure of gradual development is found in our Lord's parable of the seed growing secretly (<a href="../../par/mark/4-28.htm">Mark 4:28</a>), and is visible in <a href="../../par/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>, "They grow from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God." The verse illustrates the gradual growth and increase of the righteous in knowledge, holiness, and joy, all of which are inseparably connected in the career of such. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a></div><div class="verse">The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the wicked is as darkness.</span> In contrast with the path of the just is the way of the wicked, which is described as darkness itself: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so deeply enveloped in gloom that the wicked are not able even to see the obstacles and impediments against which they stumble, and which are the cause of their ruin. It is a way dark throughout - a <span class="accented">via tenebrosa</span> (Vulgate) - terminating at length in "the blackness of darkness." As light is emblematical of knowledge, holiness, and joy, so darkness represents ignorance, unholiness, and misery (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>). <span class="accented">Darkness</span> (<span class="accented">aphelah</span>); strictly, <span class="accented">thick darkness</span>, midnight gloom, the entire absence of light. It is the word used of the plague of "thick darkness" that settled over all the land of Egypt, even a darkness that "might be felt," when the Egyptians "saw not one another, nor any arose from his place for three days" (<a href="../../par/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). It occurs again in ch. 7:9, "in the black and <span class="accented">dark</span> night." In this darkness the wicked cannot help but stumble. Compare our Lord's teaching, "But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him" (<a href="../../par/john/11-10.htm">John 11:10</a>; cf. 12:36). The expression, <span class="cmt_word">they know not at what they stumble,</span> carries with it the idea that they are so ignorant that they neither know wickedness as wickedness, nor do they apprehend the destruction which it involves. "Sins, however great and detestable they may be, are looked upon as trivial, or as not sins at all, when men get accustomed to them" (St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' cap. 80). On "stumble" (<span class="accented">kashal</span>), see ver. 12; and on the destruction of the wicked implied in the stumbling, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, 2:18-22; 3:35.

These words are a repetition of <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>, just as the latter part of the verse reproduces the thought of <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>. <span class="accented">Depart.</span> The hiph. <span class="accented">yallizu</span> is here used instead of the kal <span class="accented">yaluzu</span> of <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>, but has the same force. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of thine heart;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in its inmost recesses; there the words and sayings are to be guarded as a man guards a treasure stowed away in the inmost chambers of a house.

The terms of the verse may be illustrated by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6, 8</a>, "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a></div><div class="verse">Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy heart with all diligence;</span> properly, <span class="accented">above all things that have to be guarded, keep or guard thy heart.</span> So Mercerus, Gescnius, Delitzsch, Zockler. This seems to be the right meaning of the phrase, <span class="accented">mikkol-mish'mar</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version "with all diligence," <span class="accented">mish'mar</span>, from <span class="accented">shamar</span>, "to guard," being the object of guarding; that which is to be guarded. It is as if the teacher said, "Guard riches, property, health, body, everything, in short, in which you have a legitimate interest, or which is advantageous; but before and above everything else, keep a guard on your heart." The rabbins Jarehi, Ben Ezra, Rashi, however, give a different rendering, "From everything which is to be avoided (<span class="accented">ab omni re cavenda</span>) guard thy heart;" but the objection to this is that it ignores the radical meaning of the verb <span class="accented">shamar</span>, from which <span class="accented">mish'mar</span> is derived, as stated above, which is not that of <span class="accented">avoiding</span>, but of <span class="accented">guarding.</span> A third rendering is," Keep thy heart with all keeping;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">omni custodia serva cor tuum</span>; and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; on which the Authorized Version seems to be based. Another rendering, similar to the first, except that it gives <span class="accented">mish'mar</span> the active signification of guarding instead of the passive one of being kept or guarded, is, "Keep thy heart more than any other keeping (<span class="accented">prae omni custodia</span>)." Origen, 'Hex.;' Field. Again, Aquila and Theodotion render, "Keep thy heart by reason of every commandment (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," thus bringing into prominence the occasion and the obligation of keeping the heart, which is that we are so commanded. <span class="accented">Heart</span> (<span class="accented">lev</span>); here the affections and the moral consciousness. <span class="cmt_word">For out of it are the issues of life.</span> The conjunction "for" introduces the reason. The fact here stated is that the moral conduct of life, its actions and proceedings, are determined by the condition of the heart. If the heart is pure, the life will be pure; if the heart is corrupt, the life will be corrupt. The heart is here compared with a fountain. The same idea which is affixed to it in its physical sense is also assigned to it in its ethical or moral sense. Physically, it is the central organ of the body; morally, it is the seat of the affections and the centre of the moral consciousness. From this moral centre flow forth "the issues of life;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the currents of the moral life take their rise in and flow forth from it, just as from the heart, physically considered, the blood is propelled and flows forth into the arterial system, by which it is conveyed to the remotest extremities of the body. And as the bodily health depends on the healthy action of the heart, so the moral health depends on and is influenced by the state in which this spring of all action is preserved. <span class="accented">Issues</span>; <span class="accented">tots'aoth</span>, from <span class="accented">yatsar</span>, "to go forth," are the place from which anything goes forth, and hence a fountain. For "the issues of life," the LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate., <span class="accented">exitus vitae.</span> With this passage compare our Lord's teaching (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43-45</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a></div><div class="verse">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The following admonitions of this chapter bear reference to the outward conduct of life. They continue the subject of ver. 23 by showing how the guarding of the heart is to be done. There is the most; intimate connection between the heart as the fountain of the moral life and of the conduct of life, which, though determined by the condition of the heart, in its turn reacts upon the heart as the moral centre, and keeps it pure. Thus the subject is treated from its two sides. On vers. 24 and 25 Hitzig remarks that they "warn against an arbitrary perverting of the moral judgment into which evil passions so easily betray, and admonish not to give misdirection to thought within the department of morality." <span class="cmt_word">A froward mouth, and perverse lips;</span> literally, <span class="accented">perverseness of mouth and waywardness of lips</span> (<span class="accented">ikk'shuth peh vulzuth s'phathayim</span>). "Perversity of mouth" is fraudulent, deceitful speech; that which twists, distorts, perverts, or misrepresents what is true, and hence falsehood (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a>).

The phrase is very similar in meaning with the parallel "waywardness of lips," which means speech which turns aside from what is true and right, the noun <span class="accented">lazuth</span> being derived from <span class="accented">lazah</span>, or <span class="accented">luz</span>, "to bend aside." The tongue is the unruly member (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). Speech is the index of the mind (Lapide). Vigilance over the heart is vigilance over the mouth, inasmuch as "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The admonition may have a twofold application, and may mean either do not indulge in this kind of speech yourself, exercise an unremitting jealousy over every propensity to it; or have no dealings with those who are guilty of it, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a></div><div class="verse">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids lock straight before thee.</span> "To look <span class="accented">right on"</span> and "to look straight <span class="accented">before</span> one" is to fix the eyes steadily and unswervingly upon an object before them, not to allow the gaze to deflect either to the right hand or to the left. As a noun, the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span>, rendered "right  on," signifies what is straight in front of one; adverbially, it has the same meaning as that given in the Authorized Version. The corresponding "before" (<span class="accented">neged</span>) is substantively the side of any object which is opposite one, and as a preposition is equivalent to "before," "in the presence of," like the Latin <span class="accented">coram.</span> The versions (LXX., Syriac, Targum) take <span class="accented">nokakh</span> in the sense of "right things:" "Let thine eyes look at right things;" contemplate them, aim at justice and equity. This meaning is given to the cognate adjective <span class="accented">nakoakh</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-26.htm">Proverbs 24:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>; but in the Proverbs the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span> only occurs twice (here and ver. 21), either as an adverb, "right on," "straightforwardly," or as a preposition, "before." <span class="accented">Look straight.</span> Gesenius takes this verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> in hiph., "to make straight," as used elliptically: "Let thine eyelids <span class="accented">direct</span> a way before thee;" but the meaning is the same as "Let them look straight before thee." The Syriac, Gejerus, and Holden render, "Let thine eyelids direct thy way before thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing rashly, but everything with premeditation; examine thy conduct, and see that it is right. The verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> has this meaning, "to direct," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, but it is here used intransitively (Mercerus). <span class="accented">Eyelids</span> (<span class="accented">aph'appim</span>); so called from their fluttering, rapid motion, here used by way of poetic parallelism with "eyes." What the command inculcates is simplicity of aim or principle, singleness of motive. The moral gaze is to be steadily fixed, because if it wanders indolently, lasciviously, aimlessly, it imperils the purity of the soul. This verse may be understood, as Zockler, as containing a command levelled against dishonest practices. The man who intends to cheat his neighbour looks this way and that how he may deceive him. Such an interpretation may be maintained on the ground that the former verse is directed against falsehood in <span class="accented">speech</span>; this against falsehood in <span class="accented">action.</span> But the former view is preferable. If you wish to keep the heart, you must be guided by simplicity of aim; look not aside either to the one hand or to the other, lest you may be led astray by the seductions and temptations which imperil the onward and upward progress of the soul. The passage reminds us of the "single eye" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), "simple," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> intent on heaven and God, of <a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>.

Simplicity of aim in the moral life is to be accompanied by attention to the moral conduct. The sense is, remove every obstacle which may impede or render insecure the way of moral life, and thus avoid every false step. The meaning "to ponder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to weigh," seems to be given to the verb <span class="accented">palles</span>, piel of the unused <span class="accented">palas</span> here used only in <a href="../../par/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a> and possibly in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>. Its ordinary signification is "to make level, or even," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>; and <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>. The LXX. keeps this in view in rendering, "Make straight paths for thy feet" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-13.htm">Hebrews 12:13</a>). The Authorized Version would mean, "Weigh your conduct as in a balance; before acting, consider the consequences and nature of the act." The second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and let all thy ways be established,</span> is in effect only a repetition of the preceding thought, since it signifies, "See that thy conduct is correct; let all thy ways be definite and fixed." The marginal reading. "And all thy ways shall be ordered aright." gives the literal rendering to the tense; <span class="accented">yikkonu</span> being the future hiph. of <span class="accented">kun</span>, "to be established," "to stand firm." This would express the <span class="accented">result</span> of giving heed to one's conduct. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - This verse, with which the teacher closes this discourse, is very closely connected with ver. 26, which it more fully explains. The command is the parallel of ver. 25. As in ver. 25, the gaze is to be concentrated. So here the feet are not to deflect nor turn aside to byways. Nothing is to be permitted to draw one off from the right way, neither adversity, nor prosperity, nor anything which can possess the power of temptation (Bayne and Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">Remove thy foot from evil.</span> A fuller expression than "depart from evil," of <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate add, "For the Lord knows the ways which are on thy right hand; but they are perverse which are on thy left.

Warning against adultery, and commendation of marriage.</span> The teacher, in this discourse, recurs to a subject which he has glanced at before in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15-19</a>, and which he again treats of in the latter part of the sixth and in the whole of the seventh chapters. This constant recurrence to the same subject, repulsive on account of its associations, shows, however, the importance which it had in the teacher's estimation as a ground of warning, and that he ranked it among the foremost of the temptations and sins which called the young off from the pursuit of Wisdom, and so led them astray from "the fear of the Lord." The vividness with which the ruin, bodily and moral, ensuing with absolute certainty on a life of vice, is described is a sufficient proof in itself that the subject before us is not brought forward from or for voluptuous motives, but for the purpose of conveying an impressive warning. Some commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Delitzsch, include the first six verses in the previous discourse; but the unity of the subject requires a different treatment. Zockler's reason against this arrangement, on the ground that the previous discourse was addressed to "tender youth," and thus to youth in a state of pupilage, while the one before us refers to more advanced age - to the married man - may be true, but is not the true ground for incorporating them in the present discourse. The unity of the subject requires that they should be taken with the central and didactic part of the discourse, as being in a sense introductory to it. The discourse divides itself into three sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The earnest appeal to attention because of the counter-attraction in the blandishments of the harlot, which, however, in the end, are bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword (vers. 1-6). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The main or didactic section (vers. 7-20), embracing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> warnings against adulterous intercourse with "the strange woman" (vers. 7-14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the antithetical admonition to use the means of chastity by remaining faithful to, and rejoicing with, the wife of one's youth (vers 15-20). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the epilogue, which, in addition to the disastrous temporal consequences which follow on the violation of the sanctity of marriage, mentioned in vers. 9-14, represents the sin as one which will be examined by the universal Judge, and which brings with it its own Nemesis or retribution. All sins of impurity, all sins against <span class="accented">temperance, soberness</span>, and <span class="accented">chastity</span>, are no doubt involved in the warning, and the subject is capable of an allegorical interpretation - a mode of treatment in some instances adopted by the LXX. rendering, as that the "strange woman" stands as the representative of <span class="accented">impenitence</span> (Miller), or, according to the earlier view of Bede, as the representative of heresy and false doctrine; but the sin which is inveighed against, and which is made the subject of these repeated warnings, is not fornication simply, but <span class="accented">adultery</span> - the violation, in its most repulsive form, of the sacred obligations of marriage. The whole discourse is an impressive commentary on the seventh commandment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The admonitory address is very similar to that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>, except that here the teacher says," Attend to <span class="accented">my wisdom</span>, bow down thine ear to <span class="accented">my understanding</span>," instead of "Attend to <span class="accented">my words</span>, and incline thine ear unto <span class="accented">my saying</span>." It is not merely "wisdom" and "understanding" in the abstract, but wisdom which he has appropriated to himself, made his own, and which he knows by experience to be true wisdom. It may therefore have the sense of experience and observation, both of which increase with years. To "bow down the ear" is to listen attentively, and so to fix the mind intently on what is being said. Compare the similar expressions in <a href="../../par/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>; 33:12. The same idea is expressed in Mare Antony's address to his countrymen, "Lend me your ears" (Shakespeare, 'Julius Caesar,' act 3. sc. 2). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse expresses the purposes or results of the preceding admonition. The first is, <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest regard discretion</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">lishmor m'zimmoth</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to guard reflection</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in other words, that thou mayest maintain thoughtfulness, observe counsel, set a proper guard or control over thy thoughts, and so restrain them within proper and legitimate limits, or form such resolutions which, being well  considered and prudential, may result in prudent conduct. The word <span class="accented">m'zimmoth</span>, however, does not travel beyond the sphere of what is conceived in the mind, and consequently does not mean conduct (as Holden conceives), except in a secondary sense, as that thoughts and plans are the necessary preliminaries to action and conduct. Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, explains, "that thou mayest not conceive in mind any evil or vanity." The word <span class="accented">m'zimmoth</span> is the plural of <span class="accented">m'zimmmah</span>, which occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>. This word generally means any plan, project, device, either in a good or bad sense. In the latter sense it is applied to intrigue and deceitful conduct, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-8.htm">Proverbs 24:8</a>. It is here used in a good sense. Indeed, Delitzsch remarks that the use of the word in a good sense is peculiar to the introductory part of the Proverbs (ch. 1-9.). The Vulgate renders. "That thou mayest guard thy thoughts or reflection (<span class="accented">ut custodias cogitationes</span>)." So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "That thou mayest guard good reflection," the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;</span> being introduced to note the sense in which the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> act of thinking, properly, is to be understood. The prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;</span> ("to") before <span class="accented">shamar</span>, "to guard," in <span class="accented">lishmor</span>, expresses the purpose, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, <span class="accented">et alia.</span> The second end in view is, that <span class="cmt_word">thy lips may keep knowledge;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and thy lips shall keep knowledge.</span> Those lips keep or preserve knowledge which literally retain the instruction of Wisdom (Zockler), or which allow nothing to pass them which does not proceed from the knowledge of God (Delitzsch), and which, when they speak, give utterance to sound wisdom. The meaning may be illustrated by <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, "I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress." The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> preserve and give utterance to it. Where "the lips keep knowledge," there they are protected against the lips of the strange woman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against her allurements, because they will be fortified with purity. <span class="accented">Thy lips</span>; <span class="accented">s'phatheyka</span> is the dual of the feminine noun <span class="accented">saphah</span>, "a lip." The teacher designedly uses this word instead of "thy heart" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1</a>), because of the contrast which he has in mind, and which be produces in the next verse. The LXX., Vulgate. and Arabic add, "Attend not to the deceitful woman," which Houbigant and Schleusner think is required by the context. The addition, however, is without authority (Holden). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The teacher enters upon the subject of his warning, and under two familiar figures - common alike to Oriental and Greek writers - describes the nature of the "strange woman's" allurements. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb</span>. The conjunction "for" (Hebrew <span class="accented">ki</span>) here, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, states the reason why the preceding exhortation is worthy of attention. Some commentators render "although," "albeit," as corresponding with the antithetical "but" in ver. 4. <span class="accented">The lips</span>; <span class="accented">siphthey</span>, the construct case of <span class="accented">saphah</span> in ver. 2. The organ of speech is here used for the speech itself, like the parallel "mouth." <span class="accented">A strange woman</span> (<span class="accented">zarah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the harlot. The word occurs before in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, and again inch. 5:20; 7:5; 22:14; 23. 33. She is <span class="accented">extranea</span>, a stranger with respect to the youth whom she would beguile, either as being of foreign extraction, or as being the wife of another man, in which capacity she is so represented in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-19.htm">Proverbs 7:19</a>. In this sense she would be an adulteress. St. Jerome, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6.htm">Ezekiel 6</a>, takes her as the representative of the allurements from sound doctrine, and of corrupt worship (Wordsworth). <span class="accented">Drop as an honeycomb</span> (<span class="accented">nopheth tithoph</span> <span class="accented">nah</span>); rather, <span class="accented">distil honey.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">nophteth</span> is properly a "dropping," <span class="accented">distillatio</span>, and so the honey flowing from the honeycombs (<span class="accented">tsuphim</span>). Kimchi explains it as the honey flowing from the cells before they are broken, and hence it is the <span class="accented">pure fine virgin honey.</span> Exactly the same phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>, "Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as an honeycomb (<span class="accented">nopheth tithoph'nah</span>)." The only other places where we meet with the word <span class="accented">nopheth</span> are <a href="../../par/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a> (11) (there combined with <span class="accented">tsuphim</span>, which helps to determine its meaning) and <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a>. The meaning is the same as she "flattereth with her words" of <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>, in which chapter the teacher gives an example of the alluring words which the strange woman uses (<a href="../../par/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14-20</a>). As honey is sweet and attractive to the taste, so in a higher degree are her words pleasant to the senses. <span class="cmt_word">Her mouth is smoother than oil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her words are most plausible and persuasive. The Hebrew <span class="accented">khik</span> is properly "the palate," though it also included the corresponding lower part of the mouth (Gesenius). It is used as the instrument or organ of speech in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-7.htm">Proverbs 8:7</a>, "For my mouth (<span class="accented">khik</span>) shall speak truth;" and in <a href="../../par/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a>, "I have not suffered my mouth (<span class="accented">khik</span>) to sin." Under the same figure David describes the treachery of his friend in <a href="../../par/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>, "His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-4.htm">Proverbs 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The contrast is drawn with great vividness between the professions of the "strange woman" and the disastrous consequences which overtake those who listen to her enticements. She promises enjoyment, pleasure, freedom from danger, but <span class="cmt_word">her end is bitter as wormwood.</span> "Her end," not merely with reference to herself, which  may be and is undoubtedly true, but the last of her as experienced by those who have intercourse with her - her character as it stands revealed at the last. So it is said of wine, "At the last," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its final effects, if indulged in to excess, "it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a>). <span class="accented">Bitter as wormwood.</span> The Hebrew, <span class="accented">laanah</span>, "wormwood," Gesenius derives from the unused root <span class="accented">laan</span>, "to curse." It is the equivalent to the <span class="accented">absinthium</span> of the Vulgate. So Aquila, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The LXX. improperly renders <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, "gall." In other places the word <span class="accented">laanah</span> is used as the emblem of bitterness, with the superadded idea of its being poisonous, also according to the Hebrew notion, shared in also by the Greeks, that the plant combined these two qualities. Thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a> it is associated with <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "a poisonful herb" (margin), and the Targum terms it, agreeably with this notion, "deadly wormwood." The same belief is reproduced in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a>, "And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter" (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>: 6:12). The apostle, no doubt, has it in mind when he speaks of any "root of bitterness," in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The herb is thus described by Umbreit: "It is a plant toward two feet high, belonging to the genus <span class="accented">Artemisia</span> (species <span class="accented">Artemisia absinthium</span>), which produces a very firm stalk with many branches, grayish leaves, and small, almost round, pendent blossoms. It has a bitter and saline taste, and seems to have been regarded in the East as also a poison, of which the frequent combination with <span class="accented">rosh</span> gives an intimation." Terence has a strikingly similar passage to the one before us - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">In melle sunt linguae sitae vestrae atque orations<br />Lacteque; corda felle sunt lita atque acerbo aceto."</span> Your tongues are placed in honey and your speech is milk; your hearts are besmeared with gall and sharp vinegar ('Trucul.,' 1:11. 75). <span class="cmt_word">Sharp as a two-edged sword;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as a sword of edges</span> (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>), which may mean a sword of extreme sharpness. Her end is as sharp as the sharpest sword. But it seems better to take the term as it is understood in the Authorized Version, which has the support both of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gladius biceps</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a two-edged sword." Compare "a two-edged sword" (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>) of <a href="../../par/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>. The meaning is, the last of her is poignancy of remorse, anguish of heart, and death. In these she involves her victims. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-5.htm">Proverbs 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Vers. 5 and 6 continue the description of the harlot. <span class="cmt_word">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell</span>. She leads her victims to ruin. She hastens to death and the grove, and so do all those who listen to her. In all instances where the teacher speaks of the harlot at length he gives the same description of her (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>). An intensifying of the language is observable in the second hemistich. The descending progress to death becomes the laying hold of the grave, the underworld, as if nothing could turn her steps aside. And it is not only death, as the cessation of life, but death as a punishment, that is implied, just as the grave has in it the idea of corruption. (On "hell," <span class="accented">sh'ol</span>, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.</span> This verse should be rather rendered, <span class="accented">she walks not in the path of life, her ways fiuctuate, she knows not.</span> It consists of a series of independent proposiyions or statements, all of which are descriptive of the singularly fatuous conduct of "the strange woman." In the previous verse the teacher has said that her conduct leads to ruin; he here further emphasizes the idea by putting forward the same truth from the opposite, or, as we may say, from the negative point of view, and so completes the picture. "The words," as Plumptre remarks, "describe with terrible vividness the state of heart and soul which prostitution brings on its victims." Her course is one o(persistent, wilful, headstrong, blind folly and wickedness. <span class="accented">Lest</span>; <span class="accented">pen</span>; here "not," equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>). So the LXX., Vulgate, Targum, Syriac. The use of <span class="accented">pen</span>, in this sense is, however, unique (Gesenius). Delitzsch and Zockler, following Luther, Geier, Holden, etc., assign to it an emphatic negative force, as, "She is <span class="accented">far removed from</span> entering," or, "she <span class="accented">never</span> treadeth." Others take <span class="accented">pen</span> as a dependent prohibitive particle, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">forte</span>, "lest," as in the Authorized Version, and employed to connect the sentence which it introduces either with the preceding verse (as Schultens) or with the second hemistich, on which it is made dependent (Holden, Wordsworth, Aben Ezra, <span class="accented">loc</span>., Michaelis, etc.). <span class="accented">Thou shouldest ponder</span>; <span class="accented">t'phalles</span>, connected by makkeph with <span class="accented">pen</span>, as usual (Lee), is either second person masculine or third person feminine. The latter is required here, the subject of the sentence being "the strange woman," as appears clearly from the second hemistich, "<span class="accented">her</span> ways," etc. The verb <span class="accented">patas</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>) here means "to prepare," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to walk in, or to travel over. Thus Gesenius renders, "She (the adulteress) prepareth not (for herself) the way of life:" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not walk in the way of life;  cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Vulgate <span class="accented">ambulant</span> (sc. <span class="accented">gressus ejus</span>), and other ancient versions, all of which understand the verb in this sense. The meaning of the phrase, <span class="accented">pen t'phalles</span>, is, therefore, "she walks not" in the way of life - the way that has life for its object, and which in itself is full of life and safety. Far from doing this, the teacher goes on to say, <span class="accented">her ways are movable</span>; literally, <span class="accented">go to and fro</span>, or <span class="accented">fluctuate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they wilfully stagger hither and thither, like the steps of a drunkard, or like the uncertain steps of the blind, for the verb <span class="accented">nua</span> is so used in the former sense in <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>; and in the latter in <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>. Her steps are slippery (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), or wander (Vulgate, <span class="accented">vagi</span>); they are without any definite aim; she is always straying in the vagrancy of sin (Wordsworth); cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>. <span class="accented">That thou canst not know them</span> (<span class="accented">lo theda</span>); literally, <span class="accented">she knows not</span>. The elliptical form of this sentence in the original leaves it open to various interpretations. It seems to refer to the way of life; she knows not the way of life, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not regard or perceive the way of life. The verb <span class="accented">yada</span> often has this meaning. The meaning may be obtained by supplying <span class="accented">mah</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">quicquam</span>, "anything," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, "She knows not anything," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she knows nothing. The objection to this is that it travels unnecessarily out of the sentence to find the object which ought rather to be supplied from the context. The object may possibly be the staggering of her feet: she staggers hither and thither without her perceiving it (Delitzsch); or it may, lastly, be indefinite: she knows not whittler her steps conduct her (Wordsworth and Zockler).

Enough, it might be supposed, had been said to deter from intercourse with the "strange woman." She has been portrayed in her real colours, plunging recklessly into ruin herself, and carrying her victims with her; deceitful, full of intrigues, neither walking in nor knowing the way of life. But the warning is amplified and made more impressive. There is another side of the picture, the complete bodily and temporal ruin of her victim. The <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem</span> is applied. There is an appeal to personal interest in the details which follow, which ought not to fail in holding youth back. The form of the address which is repeated is very similar to that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-24.htm">Proverbs 7:24</a>. The plural form, "O ye children" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a> and Proverbs 7:24), immediately passes into the singular for the reason mentioned before, that, though the address is made to all, yet each individually is to apply it to himself.

The term conveys the impression that the youth has come within the compass of her temptations, or that in the highest degree he is liable to them. The Hebrew <span class="accented">meal</span>, compounded of <span class="accented">min</span> and <span class="accented">al</span>, and meaning" from upon," being used of persons or things which go away <span class="accented">from</span> the place <span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">upon</span> which they had been. <span class="cmt_word">And come not nigh the door of her house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shun the very place where she dwells.

It is so used in <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a>. The Vulgate renders "honour," and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "life." <span class="accented">Hod</span> is derived from the Arabic word signifying "to lift one's self up," and then "to be eminent, beautiful." <span class="accented">Thy years</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the best and most vigorous, and hence the most useful and valuable, years of life. <span class="accented">Unto the cruel</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">l'ak'zari</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to the cruel one</span>; but the adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span> is only found in the singular, and may be here used in a collective sense as designating the <span class="accented">entourage of</span> the harlot, her associates who prey pitilessly on the youth whom they bring within the range of her fascinations. So Delitzsch. It seems to be so understood by the LXX., which reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">immitentibus</span>; but not so by the Vulgate, which adheres to the singular, <span class="accented">crudeli.</span> If we adhere to the gender of the adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span>, which is masculine, and to its number, it may designate the husband of the adulteress, who will deal mercilessly towards the paramour of his wife. So Zockler. Again, it may refer, notwithstanding the gender, to the harlot herself (so Vatablus and Holden). who is cruel, who has no love for the youth, and would see him perish without pity. The explanation of Stuart and others, including Ewald, that the "cruel one" is the purchaser of the punished adulterer, is without foundation or warrant, since there is no historical instance on record  where the adulterer was reduced to slavery, and the punishment inflicted by the Mosaic code was not slavery, but death (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), and, as it appears from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a> and <a href="../../par/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>, death from stoning. The adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span>, like its equivalent <span class="accented">akzar</span>, is derived from the verb <span class="accented">kazar</span>, "to break," and occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a>.

The margin reads, "thy strength" for "thy wealth," but the text properly renders the original <span class="accented">koakh</span>, which means "substance," "wealth," "riches" - the youth's possessions in money and property (Delitzsch). The primary meaning of the word is "strength" or "might," as appears from the verb <span class="accented">kakhakh</span>, "to exert one's self," from which it is derived, but the parallel <span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>, "thy toils," rendered "thy labours," determines its use in the secondary sense here. Compare the similar passage in <a href="../../par/hosea/7-9.htm">Hosea 7:9</a>, "Strangers have devoured his strength [<span class="accented">koakh, i.e.</span> ' his possessions'], and he knoweth it not" (see also <a href="../../par/job/6-22.htm">Job 6:22</a>). <span class="accented">Koakh</span> is the concrete product resulting from the abstract strength or ability when brought into action. <span class="accented">Thy labours</span> (<span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy toils, the product of laborious toil, that which you have gotten by the labour of your hands, and earned with the sweat of your brow. Fleischer compares the Italian <span class="accented">i miri sudori</span>, and the French <span class="accented">mes sueurs.</span> The singular <span class="accented">etsev</span> signifies "heavy toilsome labour," and the plural (<span class="accented">atsavim</span>, "labours," things done with toil, and so the idea passes to the resultant of the labour. Compare the very similar expression in <a href="../../par/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, <span class="accented">lekhem naatsavim</span>, equivalent to "bread obtained by toilsome labour;" Authorized Version, "the bread of sorrows." The Authorized Version properly supplies the verb "be" against those (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Holden <span class="accented">et alli</span>) who join on "thy labours" to the previous verb "be filled," as an accusative, and render, "and with thy labours in the house of a stranger." So also the LXX. and the Vulgate, "and thy labours come" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, LXX.) or "be" (<span class="accented">sint</span>, Vulgate) "to the house of strangers" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) or, "in a strange house" (<span class="accented">in aliena domo</span>). In the latter case the Vulgate is wrong, as <span class="accented">nok'ri</span> in the phrase <span class="accented">beyth nok'ri</span> is always personal (Delitzsch), and should be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "in the house of a stranger." The meaning of the verse is that a life of impurity transfers the profligate's substance, his wealth and possessions, to others, who will be satiated at his expense, and, being strangers, are indifferent to his ruin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The last argument is the mental anguish which ensues when health is ruined and wealth is squandered. <span class="cmt_word">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">v'nahamta</span> is rather "and thou groan." It is not the plaintive wailing or the subdued grief of heart which is signified, but the loud wail of lamentation, the groaning indicative of intense mental suffering called forth by the remembrance of past folly, and which sees no remedy in the future. The verb <span class="accented">naham</span> occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>, where it is used of the roaring of the lion, and the cognate noun <span class="accented">naham</span> is met with in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> and Proverbs 20:2 in the same sense. By Ezekiel it is used of the groaning of the people of Jerusalem when they shall see their sanctuary profaned, their sons and their daughters fall by the sword, and their city destroyed (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>). Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29, 30</a>) applies it to the <span class="accented">roaring</span> of the sea.

Of these two words "the flesh" (<span class="accented">basar</span>) rather denotes the flesh in its strict sense as such (cf. <a href="../../par/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>), while "body" (<span class="accented">sh'er</span>) is the flesh adhering to the bones. Gesenlus regards them as synonymous terms, stating, however, that <span class="accented">sh'er</span> is the more poetical as to use. The word <span class="accented">basar</span> is used to denote the whole body in ch. 14:30. It is clear that, by the use of these two terms here, the teacher is following a peculiarity observable elsewhere in the Proverbs, of combining two terms to express, and so to give force to, one idea. The expression describes "the utter destruction of the libertine" (Umbreit). This destruction, as further involving the ruin of the soul, is described in ch. 6:32, "Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>)" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22, 23</a>).

The fact which the ruined youth laments is the extent and audacity of his sins. It is not that he accuses himself of hypocrisy in religion (Delitzsch), but he adds another clement in his career of vice. He has disregarded the warnings and reproofs of his teachers and friends; but more, the presence of the congregation of God's people, a silent but not a less impressive protest, had no restraining effect upon him. The words, "the congregation and assembly" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">kahal v'edah</span>), seem to be used to heighten the conception, rather than to express two distinct and separate ideas, since we find them both used interchangeably to designate the congregation of the Israelites. The radical conception of <span class="accented">kahal</span> ("congregation") is the same as that of the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">ecclesia</span>, viz. the congregation looked upon from the point of its being called together, <span class="accented">kahal</span> being derived from <span class="accented">kahal</span>, which in hiph. is equivalent to "to call together," while that of <span class="accented">edah</span> is the congregation looked at from the point of its having assembled <span class="accented">edah</span> being derived from <span class="accented">yaad</span>, in niph. equivalent to "to come together." The latter will therefore stand for any assembly of people specially convened or coming together for some definite object, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">synagoga</span>. The term <span class="accented">edah</span> is, however, used in a technical sense as signifying the <span class="accented">seventy elders</span>, or senators, who judged the people (see <a href="../../par/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>).

Other explanations, however, have been given of these words. Zockler takes <span class="accented">kahal</span> as the convened council of elders acting as judges (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4, 5</a>), and <span class="accented">edah</span> as the concourse (<span class="accented">coetus</span>) of the people executing the condemning sentence (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>), and renders, "Well nigh had I fallen into utter destruction in the midst of the assembly and the congregation." Fleischer, Vatablus, and Bayne take much the same view, looking upon <span class="accented">ra</span> ("evil," Authorized Version) as "punishment," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the evil which follows as a consequence of sin - a usage supported by <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/5-19.htm">Exodus 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a> - rather than as evil <span class="accented">per se, i.e.</span> that which is morally bad, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22</a>.

The allegorical exposition of this passage, current at the period of the Revision of the Authorized Version in 1612, as referring to liberality, is not <span class="accented">ad rem</span>. Such an idea had no place certainly in the teacher's mind, nor is it appropriate to the context, the scope of which is, as we have seen, to warn youth against indulgence in illicit pleasures, by pointing out the terrible consequences which follow, and to indicate, on the other hand, in what direction the satisfaction of natural wants is to be obtained, that so, the heart and conscience being kept pure, sin and evil may be avoided. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Drink waters out of thine own cistern,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the wife of your own choice, or in the legitimate sphere of marriage, seek the satisfaction of your natural impulses. The pure, innocent, and chaste nature of such pleasures is appropriately compared with the pure and wholesome waters of the cistern and the wellspring. The "drinking" carries with it the satisfying of a natural want. Agreeably with oriental and scriptural usage, "the wife" is compared with a "cistern" and "well." Thus in the Song of Solomon the "bride" is called a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (<a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>). Sarah is spoken of under exactly the same figure that is used here, viz. the <span class="accented">bor</span>, or "cistern," in <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>. The figure was not confined to women, however, as we find Judah alluded to as "waters" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>,  and Jacob or Israel so appearing in the prophecy of Balaam (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-7.htm">Numbers 24:7</a>). The people are spoken of by David as they that are "of the fountain of Israel" (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>). A similar imagery is employed in the New Testament of the wife. The apostles St. Paul and St. Peter both speak of her as "the vessel (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). The forms of the original, <span class="accented">b'or</span> and <span class="accented">b'er</span>, standing respectively for "cistern" and "well," indicate a common derivation from <span class="accented">baar</span>, "to dig." But <span class="accented">bor</span> is an artificially constructed reservoir or cistern, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">cisterna</span>, and LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is the natural spring of water, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">putens.</span> So Aben Ezra, who says, on <a href="../../par/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>:36, "<span class="accented">Bor</span> is that which catches the rain, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is that from within which the water wells up." This explanation, however, does not entirely cover the terms as used here. The "waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mayim</span>) may be the pure water conveyed into the cistern, and not simply the water which is caught in its descent born heaven. The parallel term, "running waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">noz'lim</span>), describes the flowing limpid stream fit, like the other, for drinking purposes. A similar use of the terms is made in the <a href="../../par/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, "a well of living waters (<span class="accented">b'er mayim khayyim</span>) and streams (<span class="accented">v'noz'lim</span>) from Lebanon." It may be remarked that the allusion to the wife, under the figures employed, enhances her value. It indicates the high estimation in which she is to be held, since the "cistern" or "well" was one of the most valuable possessions and adjuncts of an Eastern house. The teaching of the passage, in its bearing on the subject of marriage, coincides with that which is subsequently put forward by St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>.

So Aben Ezra and the majority of modern commentators, Schultens, Doderlein, Holden, Muenscher, Noyes, Wardlaw, etc. The meaning appears to be, "Let thy marriage be blessed with many children, who may go forth abroad for the public good." Other interpretations have been adopted. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch takes the words fountans and "rivers of waters" as used figuratively for the procreative power, and renders, "Shall thy streams flow abroad, and water brooks in the streets?" and interprets, "Let generative power act freely and unrestrainedly within the marriage relation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Schultens and Dathe, followed by Holden, regard the verse as expressing a conclusion on the preceding, "Then shall thy springs be dispersed abroad, even rivers of waters in the streets." The objection to this is that it necessitates the insertion of the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>) before the verb, <span class="accented">yaphutzu</span>, "be dispersed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Zockler and Hitzig read the verse interrogatively, "Shall thy streams flow abroad as water brooks in the streets?" on the analogy of <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The reading of the LXX., adopted by Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, places a negative before the verb, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Let not thy waters flow beyond thy fountain;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "confine thyself to thy wife." <span class="accented">Fountains.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">ma'yanim</span>, plural of <span class="accented">mayan</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ayin</span> ("a fountain") with the formative <span class="accented">men</span>, is rather a stream or rill - water flowing on the surface of the ground.

The <span class="accented">peleg</span> represents the various streams into which the <span class="accented">mayan</span>, "fountain," divides itself at its source or in its course. We find the same expression, <span class="accented">pal'gey-mayim</span>, used of tears in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-136.htm">Psalm 119:136</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>. It occurs again in our book in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of waters (<span class="accented">pal'gey mayim</span>)." On "abroad" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khutz</span>), and "in the streets" (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>.

Promiscuous and unlawful intercourse throws doubt upon the paternity of children. Thy children may be thine, they may belong to another. The natural pride which is felt in a legitimate offspring is the motive put forward to commend the husband to confine himself exclusively to his wife. Grotius on this verse remarks, "Ibi sere ubi prolem metas" - "Sow there where you may reap an offspring." <span class="accented">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children referred to figuratively in the preceding verse, from which the subject of this verse is supplied. The repetition of the pronoun which occurs in the original, "let them belong to thee, to thee," is emphatic, and exclusive of others. The latter clause of the verse, "and not strangers' with thee," covers the whole ground. The idea of their being strangers' is repulsive, and so gives further point to the exhortation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth</span>. The employment of the ordinary term "wife" in the second hemistich shows in what sense the figure which is used has to be understood. The terms "fountain" and "wife" denote the same person. The wife is here called "thy fountain" (Hebrew,  <span class="accented">m'kor'ka</span>), just as she has been previously "thine own cistern" (<span class="accented">b'or</span>) and "thine own well" (<span class="accented">b'er</span>) in ver. 15. The Hebrew <span class="accented">makor</span>, "fountain," is derived from the root <span class="accented">kur</span>, "to dig." The figure seems to determine that the blessing here spoken of consists in the with being a fruitful mother of children; and hence the phrase means, "Let thy with be blessed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered happy in being the mother of thy children. This is quite consistent with the Hebrew mode of thought. Every Israelitish wife regarded herself, and was regarded by ethers as "blessed," if she bore children, and unhappy if the reverse were the case. <span class="accented">Blessed</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">baruk</span> (Vulgate, <span class="accented">benedicta</span>), is the kal participle passive of <span class="accented">barak</span>, "to bless." Instead of this, the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "Let thy fountain be thine own" - a variation which in no sense conveys the meaning of the original. <span class="accented">And rejoice with</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rejoice in</span>, the wife being regarded as the sphere within which the husband is to find his pleasure and joy. Umbreit explains, "Let thy wife be extolled." The same construction of the imperative <span class="accented">s'makh</span>, from <span class="accented">samakh</span>," to be glad, or joyful," with <span class="accented">min</span>, occurs in <a href="../../par/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>, etc. The Authorized rendering is, however, favoured by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">laetare cum</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> Compare the exhortation in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>, "Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest." <span class="accented">The wife of thy youth</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ishshah n'ureyka</span>) may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wife to whom thou hast given the fair bloom of thy youth (Umbreit); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wife chosen in thy youth (Delitzsch); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> thy youthful wife. The former seems the more probable meaning. Compare the expression, "companion of thy youth," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe.</span> The words in italics do not occur in the original. The expression, "the loving hind and pleasant roe," is, therefore, to be attached to the preceding verse, as carrying on the sense and as descriptive of the grace and fascinating charms of the young wife. As combining these attributes, she is to be the object of thy love and devotion,the one in whom thine affections are to find the fulfilment of their desires. Love and grace are her possessions. The <span class="accented">loving hind</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ayyeleth ahavim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the hind of loves</span>, which may be understood, as in the Authorized Version, as pointing to the fondness of this animal for its young, or as descriptive of its beauty and the extreme gracefulness of its form. In this sense the phrase may be rendered, "the lovely hind." The <span class="accented">ayyeleth</span>, or <span class="accented">ayyalah</span>, feminine of <span class="accented">ayyal</span>, "stag," or "hart," was in all probability the gazelle, <span class="accented">Pleasant roe</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">yhaalath khen</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the ibex of grace.</span> The particular expression only occurs here in the Bible. <span class="accented">The yaalath is the</span> feminine of <span class="accented">yaal</span>, "the ibex" or "mountain goat" according to Bochart, or the "chamois" according to Gesenius. It does not appear that it is so much "the pleasantness" or amiability of this animal which is here alluded to as its gracefulness of form. As terms of endearment, the words entered largely into the erotic poetry of the East. Thus in the <a href="../../par/songs/4-5.htm">Song of Solomon 4:5</a> the bride likens her beloved to "a roe or young hart" (cf. also <a href="../../par/songs/4.htm">Song of Solomon 4</a>:17 and Song 8:14). while numerous examples might be quoted from the Arabian and Persian poets. They were also employed sometimes as names for women. Compare the superscription of <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, <span class="accented">Ayyeleth hash-shakar</span>, "Upon the hind of the dawn." <span class="cmt_word">Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times.</span> The love of the wife is to refresh and fully satisfy the husband. The word <span class="accented">dadeyah</span>, "her breasts," only occurs here and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3, 8, 21</a>, and is equivalent to <span class="accented">dodeyah</span>, "her love." The marginal reading, "water thee," serves to bring out the literal meaning of the <span class="accented">y'ravvuka</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ravah</span>, in kal, "to drink largely," "to be satisfied with drink," but misses the emphatic force of the piel, "to be fully satisfied or satiated." This is expressed very forcibly in the Vulgate rendering, "Let her breasts inebriate thee (<span class="accented">indebrient te</span>)," which represents the strong influence which the attractions of the wife are to maintain. The LXX., on the other hand, avoiding the rather sensual colouring of the language, substitutes, "May she thine own lead thee, and be with thee always." <span class="cmt_word">And be thou ravished always with her love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it intoxicate thee. The teacher, by a bold figure, describes the entire fascination which the husband is to allow the wife to exercise over him. The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is "to reel under the influence of wine," and is so used in the succeeding vers. 20 and 23, and <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>. The primary meaning, "to err from the way," scarcely applies here, and does not express the idea of the teacher, which is to describe "an intensity of love connected with the feeling of superabundant happiness" (Delitzsch). The Vulgate, <span class="accented">In amore ejus delectare jugiter</span>, "In her love delight thyself continually," and the LXX., "For in her love thou shalt be daily engaged," are mere paraphrases.

The teaching assumes a higher tone, and rises from the lower law which regulates fidelity to the wife, based upon personal attractions, to the higher law, which brings the husband's  conduct into relation with the duty he owes to Jehovah. Not merely is his conduct to be regulated by love and affection alone, but it is to be fashioned by the reflection or consciousness that the Supreme Being presides over all, and takes cognizance of human action. Without losing sight that the marriage contract has its own peculiar obligations, the fact is insisted upon that all a man's ways are open to the eyes of the Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And why</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what inducement is there, what reason can be given, for conjugal infidelity, except the lewd and immoral promptings of the lower nature, except sensuality in its lowest form? <span class="cmt_word">Ravished</span>.

The consciousness of this fact is to be the restraining motive, inasmuch as he who sees will also punish every transgression. The great truth acknowledged here is the omniscience of God, a truth which is borne witness to in almost identical language in Job: "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (<a href="../../par/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>; cf. 24:23 and Job 31:4). So Hanani the seer says to Asa King of Judah, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>); and Jehovah says, in Jeremiah, "For mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-17.htm">Jeremiah 16:17</a>; cf. 32:29); and again, in Hosea, "They are before my face" (<a href="../../par/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>), and the same truth is re-echoed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in all probability gathered from our passage, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>)<span class="accented">. The ways of man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of any individual man or woman; <span class="accented">ish</span>, "man," being used generically. <span class="accented">Are before the eyes of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are an object on which Jehovah fixes his gaze and scrutiny. And he pondereth all his goings. The word "he pondereth" is in the original <span class="accented">m'phalles</span>, the piel participle <span class="accented">of philles</span>, piel of the unused kal, <span class="accented">palas</span>, and appears to be properly rendered in the Authorized Version. This verb, however, has various meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to make level, or prepare, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a> and Proverbs 5:6; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to weigh, or consider accurately, in which sense it is used here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So Gesenius, Lee, Buxtorf, and Davidson. Jehovah not only sees, but weighs all that a man does, wheresoever he be, and will apportion rewards and punishments according to a man's actions (Patrick). The German commentators, Delitzsch and Zockler, however, look upon the word as indicating the overruling providence of God, just as the former part of the verse refers to his omniscience, and render, "he marketh out," in the sense that the Lord makes it possible for a man to walk in the way of uprightness and purity. There is nothing inherently objectionable in this view, since experience shows that the world is regulated by the Divine government, but it loses sight to some extent of the truth upon which the teacher appears to be insisting, which is that evil actions are visited with Divine retribution.

From the universal statement of God's omniscience and the Divine judgment, the teacher passes to the fate of the profligate. His end is inevitable ruin and misery. The deep moral lesson conveyed is that sin carries with it its own Nemesis. Adultery and impurity, like all sin of which they are forms, are retributive. The career of the adulterer is a career begun, continued, and ended in folly (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>; and <a href="../../par/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his manifold sins shall overtake and arrest him. The imagery is borrowed from the snare of the fowler. The emphatic form of the original, "His sins shall overtake him, the impious man," point conclusively to the adulterer. It is "his" sins that shall overtake him, not those of another, and they shall fall upon his own head; and further, his character is depicted in the condemning clause, "the impious man;" for such he is. <span class="accented">Shall take.</span> The verb <span class="accented">lakad</span> is literally "to take or catch animals in a snare or net," properly "to strike with a net." The wicked man becomes entangled and caught in his own sins; he is struck down and captured by  them, just as the prey is struck by the snare of the fowler. The verb is, of course, used metaphorically, as in <a href="../../par/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. <span class="accented">The wicked</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">eth-harasa</span>); in the original introduced as explanatory of the object, "him." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</span> The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate in rendering "his sins," instead of the original "his sin" (<span class="accented">khattatho</span>). It is not so much every sin of man which shall hold him, though this is true, as the particular sin treated of in the address, viz. adultery, which shall do this. The expression, "the cords of his sin" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khavley khattatho</span>), means the cords which his sin weaves around him. Nothing else will be requisite to bind and hold him fast for punishment (cf. "cords of vanity," in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a>).

The obvious meaning is, because he gave no heed to instruction. So Aben Ezra and Gersom. The Authorized Version is at least ambiguous, and seems to imply that the adulterer has been without instruction, without any to reprove or counsel him. But such is not the case. He has been admonished of the evil consequences of his sin, but to these warnings he has turned a deaf ear, and the teacher says therefore he shall die. The Vulgate supports this explanation, <span class="accented">quia non habuit disciplinam</span> "because he did not entertain or use instruction." In the LXX. the idea is enlarged, "He shall die together with these who have no instruction (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)."

A climax is reached in the manner in which the end of the adulterer is portrayed. His end is without a gleam of hope or satisfaction. With an understanding darkened and rendered callous by unrestrained indulgence in lust, and by folly which has reached its utmost limits and cannot, as it were, be surpassed, in that it has persistently and wilfully set aside and scorned wisdom and true happiness, the adulterer, like the drunkard, who is oblivious of the danger before him, shall stagger to ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm"><title>Proverbs 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/5.htm" title="Proverbs 5">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 6 <a href="../proverbs/7.htm" title="Proverbs 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-35.</span> - The sixth chapter embraces four distinct discourses, each of which is a warning. The subjects treated of are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> suretyship (vers. 1-5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> sloth (vers. 6-11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> malice (vers. 12-19); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> adultery (ver. 20 to the end). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The continuity of the subject treated of in the preceding chapter appears to be somewhat abruptly interrupted to make way for the insertion of three discourses on subjects which apparently have little connection with what precedes and what follows. Their unlooked for and unexpected appearance has led Hitzig to regard them as interpolations, but it has been conclusively pointed out by Delitzsch that there is sufficient internal evidence, in the grammatical construction, figures, word formations, delineations, and threatenings, to establish the position that they proceeded from the same hand that composed the rest of the book and to guarantee their genuineness. But another and not less interesting question arises as to whether any connection subsists between these discourses and the subject which they apparently interrupt. Such a connection is altogether denied by Delitzsch, Zockler, and other German commentators, who look upon them as independent discourses, and maintain that, if there is any connection, it can be only external and accidental. On the other hand, Bishops Patrick and Wordsworth discover an ethical connection which, though not clear at first sight, is not on that account less real or true. The subject treated of in the preceding chapter is the happiness of the married life, and this is imperilled by incautious undertaking of suretyship, and suretyship, it is maintained, induces sloth, while sloth leads to maliciousness After treating of suretyship, sloth, and malice in succession, the teacher recurs to the former subject of his discourse, viz. impurity of life, against which he gives impressive warnings. That such is the true view them appears little doubt. One vice is intimately connected with another, and the verdict of experience is that a life of idleness is one of the most prolific sources of a life of impurity. Hence we find Ovid saying - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quaeritur, AEgisthus, qua re sit factus adulter?<br />In promptu causa est - desidiosus erat."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Do you ask why AEgisthus has become an adulterer?<br />The reason is close at hand - he was full of idleness."</span> Within the sphere of these discourses them. selves the internal connection is distinctly observable, vers. 16-19 being a refrain of vers. 12-15, and the phrase, "to stir up strife," closing each enumeration (see vers. 14 and 19). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - 9. <span class="accented">Ninth admonitory discourse. Warning against suretyship.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The contents of this section are  not to be taken so much as an absolute unqualified prohibition of suretyship as counsel directed against the inconsiderate and rash undertaking of such an obligation. There were some occasions on which becoming surety for another was demanded by the laws of charity and prudence, and when it was not inconsistent with the humane precepts of the Mosaic Law as enunciated in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>. In other passages of our book the writer of the Proverbs lays down maxims which would clearly countenance the practice (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-10.htm">Proverbs 27:10</a>), and in the apocryphal writings the practice is encouraged, if not enjoined (Ecclus. 29:14 Ecclus. 8:13). Notwithstanding this limitation, however, it is observable that suretyship is almost invariably spoken of in terms of condemnation, and the evil consequences which it entailed on the surety may be the reason why it is so frequently alluded to. The teacher refers to the subject in the following passages: here; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>: 17:18; 22:26; 20:16; 27:13. <span class="cmt_word">My son</span>. On this address, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">If thou be surety</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">im-aravta</span>); literally, <span class="accented">if thou hast become surety</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">si spoponderis.</span> What the teacher counsels in the present instance is that, if by inadvertence a person has become surety, he should by the most strenuous endeavours prevail on his friend to free him from the bond. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">arav</span> is properly "to mix," and then signifies "to become surety" in the sense of interchanging with another and so taking his place. The frequent mention of suretyship in the Proverbs is alluded to above. The first recorded instances are those where Judah offers to become surety for Benjamin, first to Israel (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>), and secondly to Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/44-33.htm">Genesis 44:33</a>). It is singular that it is only once alluded to in the Book of Job, where Job says, "Lay down now, put me in surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?" (<a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>); and once only, and that doubtfully, in the whole of the Mosaic writings, in the phrase <span class="accented">tesummat yad, i.e.</span> giving or striking the hand in the case of perjury (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2</a>). The psalmist refers to it in the words, "Be surety for thy servant for good" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a>). It is spoken of twice in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>), once in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:27) and in Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3</a>), and the cognate noun, <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, "the pledge," security for payment, is met with in <a href="../../par/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>. These scattered notices in the Old Testament show that the practice was always in existence, while the more frequent notices in the Proverbs refer to a condition of society where extended commercial transactions had apparently made it a thing of daily occurrence, and a source of constant danger. In the New Testament one instance of suretyship is found, when St. Paul offers to become surety to Philemon for Onesimus (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>). But in the language of the New Testament, the purely commercial meaning of the word is transmuted into a spiritual one. The gift of the Spirit is regarded as the <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pledge," the earnest of the Christian believer's acceptance with God (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For thy friend;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">l'reeka.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">reeh</span>, more usually <span class="accented">rea</span>, is "the companion or friend," and in this case obviously the debtor for whom one has become surety. The word reappears in ver. 3. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) prefixed to <span class="accented">reeh</span> is the <span class="accented">dativus commodi.</span> So Delitzsch and others. If not in the original, but rightly inserted. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">taka'ta lazzar kapeyka</span>); properly, <span class="accented">thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger.</span> The analogous use of <span class="accented">l</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>) in <span class="accented">lazzar</span> determines this rendering. As in the corresponding <span class="accented">l'reeyka</span>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) indicates the person for whose benefit the suretyship is undertaken, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the debtor, and not the person <span class="accented">with</span> whom the symbolical act is performed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the creditor. Compare the following passages, though the construction with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> is wanting: "He that is surety for a stranger" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>); "Take his garment that is surety for a stranger" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a> and Proverbs 27:13). "The stranger," <span class="accented">zar</span>, is not an alien, or one belonging to another nationality, but simply one extraneous to one's self, and so equivalent to <span class="accented">akher</span>, "another." The meaning, therefore, seems to be, "If thou hast entered into a bond for one with whom thou art but slightly acquainted." Others (Wordsworth, Plumptre), however, take <span class="accented">zar</span> as representing the foreign money lender. The phrase, "to strike the hand," <span class="accented">taka kaph</span>, or simply "to strike," <span class="accented">taka</span>, describes the symbolical act which accompanied the contract. <span class="accented">Taka is</span> properly "to drive," like the Latin <span class="accented">defigere</span>, and hence "to strike," and indicates the sharp sound with which the hands were brought into contact. The act no doubt was accomplished before witnesses, and the hand which was stricken was that of the creditor, who thereby received assurance that the responsibility of the debtor was undertaken by the surety. The "striking of the hand" as indicating the completion of a contract is illustrated by the author of the 'Kamoos' (quoted by Lee, on <a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>), who says, "He struck or clapped to him a sale...  he struck his hand in a sale, or on his hand...  he struck his ow hand upon the hand of him, and this is among the necessary (transactions) of sale." So among  Western nations the giving of the band has been always regarded as a pledge of <span class="accented">bona fides.</span> Thus Menelaus demands of Helena (Euripides, 'Hel.,' 838), <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, "Touch my right hand now on these conditions," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in attestation that you accept them. In purely verbal agreements it is the custom in the present day for the parties to clasp the hand. A further example may be found in the plighting of troth in the Marriage Service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art snared with the words of thy month,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the inevitable consequence of an inconsiderate undertaking of suretyship is that you become entangled and involved by your own premises, and hampered by self-imposed obligations. The Authorized Version rightly regards this as the conclusion. So the Vulgate. Others, however, carry on the hypothesis, and insert <span class="accented">im</span>, "if:" "If thou art snared," etc.; but without warrant (Zockler, Wordsworth, Plumptre). The LXX. throws the thought into the form of a proverb, as "a strong net to a man are his own words." A distinction is to be drawn between the verbs rendered "entangled" and "taken;" the former, <span class="accented">yakosh</span>, signifying to be taken unwarily, off one's guard; the latter, <span class="accented">lakad</span>, referring, as before observed (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), to the being stricken with the net. They are found in the same collocation in <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>, "Many among them shall be <span class="accented">snared</span> and <span class="accented">taken."</span> The repetition of the phrase, "with the words of thy mouth," is not unintentional or purely rhetorical. It is made, as Delitzsch observes, to bring with greater force to the mind that the entanglements in which the surety is involved are the result of his own indiscretion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - In this verse advice is tendered as to what is to be done under the circumstances of this entanglement. The surety is to take immediate steps to be set free. The urgency of the advice is to be explained by the serious consequences which would follow in the event of the debtor not satisfying the creditor in due time. The surety became liable to the penalties inflicted by the Hebrew law of debt. His property could be distrained. His bed and his garment could be taken from him (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a> and Proverbs 20:16), and he was liable as well as his family to be reduced to the condition of servitude. So we find the son of Sirach saying, "Suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations" (Ecclus. 29:18; cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>; and <a href="../../par/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). Compare the dictum of Thales, the Greek philosopher, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "Give surety, and ruin is near;" and that of Chilo (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 6:32), "Sponsioni non deest jactura" - "Loss is not wanting to a surety." The same idea is conveyed in the modern German proverb, "Burgen soll man wurgen" - "Worry a surety" <span class="cmt_word">Do this now;</span> or, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> The particle <span class="accented">epho</span> is intensive, and emphasizes the command, and in this sense is of frequent occurrence (<a href="../../par/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/27-32.htm">Genesis 27:32</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>, etc.). It appears to be equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">quod dico.</span> So the Vulgate, "Do therefore what I say;" similarly the LXX. renders, "Do, my son, what I bid thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." It carries with it the sense of instant and prompt action. <span class="cmt_word">And deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> set thyself free when thou findest thou art actually at the mercy of thy friend for whom thou hast become surety. The <span class="accented">ki</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is not hypothetical, but actual; it is not "if" you are, but "when" or because you actually are in his power. The Vulgate and LXX. render <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> respectively by <span class="accented">quia</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Go, humble thyself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> present thyself as a suppliant, prostrate thyself, offer thyself to be trodden upon (Michaelis), or humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon (Rashi). or humble thyself under the soles of his feet (Aben Ezra). The expression implies the spirit of entire submission, in which the surety is to approach his friend in order to be released from his responsibility. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">hith'rappes</span> has, however, been rendered differently. Radically <span class="accented">raphas</span> signifies "to tread or trample with the feet," and this has been taken to express haste, or the bestirring of one's self. So the Vulgate reads <span class="accented">festina</span>, "hasten;" and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not remiss." But the hithp, clearly determines in favour of the reflexive rendering; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>, "Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver" - the only other passage where <span class="accented">raphas</span> occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And make sure thy friend</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">r'hav reeyka</span>); rather, <span class="accented">importune thy friend</span>, be urgent with him, press upon him to fulfil his engagement. The verb <span class="accented">rahav</span> is properly "to be fierce," "to rage," and hence with the accusative, as here, "to assail with impetuosity." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a> it is used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>), and signifies to act fiercely against any one. The meaning of the passage is that if abject submission or persuasion does not avail, then sterner measures are to be resorted to to gain the desired end. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - This verse carries on the thought one step further. The appeal to the friend is not to be confined to one spasmodic effort and then relinquished. He is to be followed up pertinaciously and continually, with unwearied diligence, until prevailed upon to  fulfil his engagements. Of this unwearied energy in the pursuit of an object in which cue is deeply interested, compare David's resolution, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob" (<a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-5.htm">Proverbs 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter</i>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The struggles of the roe and the bird to escape from the snare are employed figuratively to describe the efforts which the surety is to make to tear and free himself from his friend. <span class="cmt_word">From the hand</span> of the hunter (Hebrew, <span class="accented">miyyad</span>); literally, <span class="accented">from the hand</span>, as shown by the italics. The variation in all the ancient versions, with the exception of the Vulgate and Venetian, which read "from the snare," suggests that the original text was <span class="accented">mippath</span> instead of <span class="accented">miyyad.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">yad</span>, "hand," may, however, be used by metonymy for a toil or gin; but this is improbable, as no example of this kind can be found. With regard to the addition, "of the hunter," though this does not occur in the original, the parallelism would seem to clearly require it, and Bottcher maintains, but upon insufficient evidence, and against the reading of all manuscripts, which omit it, that the word <span class="accented">tsayyad</span>, equivalent to "of the hunter," formed part of the original text, but has fallen out. The plain reading, "from the hand," may, however, be used absolutely, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>, "Because thou hast let go out of thy hand (miyyad)," in which case the hand will not be that of the hunter, but that of the person for whom the one is surety. <span class="cmt_word">Roe</span>. There is a paronomasia in <span class="accented">ts'vi</span>, equivalent to "roe," and <span class="accented">tsiphor</span>, equivalent to "bird," of the original, which is lost in the Authorized Version. The <span class="accented">ts'vi</span> is the "roe" or "gazelle," so named from the beauty of its form (see also <a href="../../par/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7-9, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/3-5.htm">Song of Solomon 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/8-14.htm">Song of Solomon 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>). <span class="accented">Tsippor</span> is a generic word, and represents any small bird. It is derived from the twittering or chirping noise which the bird makes, the root being <span class="accented">tsaphar</span>, "to chirp, or twitter." As to its identification with the sparrow, <span class="accented">Passer montanus</span>, or the blue thrush, <span class="accented">Petrocossyphus cyanens</span> (see 'Bible Animals,' Rev. J.G.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-11.</span> - 10. <span class="accented">Tenth admonitory discourse. Warning against sloth.</span> The ethical connection of this discourse with the preceding has already been pointed out. Sloth militates against prosperity; it is the prolific parent of want, and, even more surely than suretyship, leads to misfortune and ruin, The certainty with which ruin steals upon the sluggard may be the reason why the teacher closes the discourse in the way he does. In the case of suretyship such an issue is uncertain; there is the possibility of escape, the surety may prevail upon his friend to release him from his obligation, and so he may escape ruin; but with sloth no such contingency is possible, its invariable end is disaster. So far as the grammatical structure of the two discourses is concerned, they appear to be quite independent of each other, the only points of coincidence observable being the repetition of one or two words, which is purely accidental (cf. "go" in vers. 3 and 6, and "sleep" and "slumber" in vers. 4 and 10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</span> The ant (Hebrew, <span class="accented">n'malah</span>) is here brought forward as supplying an example of wisdom to the sluggard. The habits of this insect, its industry and providence, have in all ages made it the symbol of these two qualities, and not only the sacred, but also profane writers have praised its foresight, and held it up for imitation. The ant is only mentioned twice in the Old Testament, and on both occasions in our book (see present passage and <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>). The derivation of <span class="accented">n'malah</span> is either from the root <span class="accented">nam</span>, with reference first to the silence with which it moves, and secondly to its active yet unperceived motion (Delitzsch), or from <span class="accented">namal</span>, <span class="accented">i.q.</span> <span class="accented">malal</span>, "to cut off," from its cutting off or consuming seeds (<span class="accented">ab incidendis seminibus</span>) (Buxtorf, Gesenius). The Aramaic name, <span class="accented">shum'sh'manah</span>, however, points to its activity and rapid running hither and thither (Fleischer). <span class="accented">Sluggard</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">atsel</span>, a verbal adjective tbund only in the Proverbs. The primary idea of the root <span class="accented">atsal</span> is that of languor and laxity. The cognate abstract nouns <span class="accented">ats'lah</span> and <span class="accented">ats'luth</span>, equivalent to "slothfulness," occur in <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>. <span class="accented">Consider her ways</span>; attentively regard them, and from them derive a lesson of wisdom. Her ways are the manner in which the ant displays her industry and foresight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-7.htm">Proverbs 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler.</span> This statement is substantially correct, for though the most recent observations made by modern naturalists have discovered various classes of ants occupying the same ant hill, yet there appears to be a total want of that gradation and subordination in ant life which is noticeable among bees. The three terms used here, <span class="accented">katsa, shoter, moshel</span>, all refer to government, and correspond respectively with the modern, Arabic terms, <span class="accented">kadi, wall</span>, and <span class="accented">emir</span> (Zockler). The first refers to the judicial office, and should rather be rendered "judge," the root  <span class="accented">katsah</span> being "to decide" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>). The word, however, is used of a military commander in <a href="../../par/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6-11</a>, and in this sense it is understood by the Vulgate, which has <span class="accented">dux. Shoter</span>, rendered "overseer," is literally "a scribe," and appears as the general designation for any official In <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6, 19</a> the <span class="accented">shoter</span> is the person employed by the Egyptian taskmasters to urge on the Israelites in their forced labour; in <a href="../../par/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> the <span class="accented">shoter</span> is one of the seventy elders; and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a> he is a municipal magistrate. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized Version seems to be the correct one. The ant has no overseer; there is none to regulate or see that the work is done. Each ant apparently works independently of the rest, though guided by a common instinct to add to the common store. In <span class="accented">moshel</span> we have the highest title of dignity and power, the word signifying a lord, prince, or ruler, from <span class="accented">mashal</span>, "to rule." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</span> It is this characteristic, combined with what has just been said, which gives point to the lesson the sluggard is to learn. The teacher, as it were, argues: If the ant, so insignificant a creature in the order of the animal kingdom, is so provident, how much more should you be - you, a man endued with superior intelligence, and with so many more resources at hand, and with greater advantages! If the ant, with none to urge, direct, or control her work, is so industrious, surely she provides an example at which you, the sluggard, should blush, since there is every external incentive to rouse you to action - your duty to the community, the urgent advice of your friends, and your dignity as a man. If she provides for the future, much more should you do so, and threw off your sloth. Objection has been taken to what is here stated of the provident habits of the ant in storing food, on the ground that it is carnivorous and passes the winter in a state of torpidity. That the ant does lay up stores for future use has, however, been the opinion of all ages. Thus Hesiod ('Days,' 14) speaks of the ant as harvesting the grain, calling it <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the provident." Virgil says ('Georg.,' 1, 186; cf. 'AEneid,' 4:4027) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum<br />Quum populant hiemis memores, tectoque repenunt."</span> So the ants, when they plunder a tall heap of corn, mindful of the winter, store it in their cave. The language of Horace ('Sat.,' 1:50, 32) might be a comment on our passage - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris sicut<br />Ore trahit quodcunque potest, atque addit acervo,<br />Quem struit, haud ignara ac non incauta futuri,<br />Quae, simul universum contristat Aquarius annum<br />Non usquam prorepit, et illis utitur ante Quaesitis sapiens."</span><br /><br /><span class="accented">"For thus the little ant (to human lore<br />No mean example) forms her frugal store,<br />Gathered, with mighty toils, on every side,<br />Nor ignorant, nor careless to provide<br />For future want; yet when the stars appear<br />That darkly sadden the declining year,<br />No more she comes abroad, but wisely lives<br />On the fair store industrious summer gives."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Francis' Translation.</span>) The same provident character is noted in AEsop's fable, 'The Ant and the Grasshopper;' see also Aristotle ('Hist. Nat.,' 9:6). All objections on this subject appear to be based on insufficient data, and have been conclusively answered by recent observation. Apart from the remark of Buffon, that "the ants of tropical climates <span class="accented">lay up provisions</span>, and as they probably live the whole year, they submit themselves to regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe." The late Professor Darwin states of the agricultural ant of Texas, which in many features resembles the ant of Palestine, that it not only <span class="accented">stores its food</span>, but prepares the soil for the crops, keeps the ground free from weeds, and finally reaps the harvest (<span class="accented">Journal of Linnaean Society</span>, vol. 1, No. 21, p. 29). Canon Tristram also observes, "The language of the wise man is not only in accordance with the universal belief of his own time, but with the accurately ascertained facts of natural history. Contrary to its habits in colder climates, the ant is not there dormant through the winter; and among the tamerisks of the Dead Sea it may be seen, in January, actively engaged in collecting the aphides and saccharine exudations, in long flies passing and repassing up and down the trunk. Two of the most common species of the Holy Land (<span class="accented">Alta barbara</span>, the black ant, and <span class="accented">Alta structor</span>, the brown ant) are strictly seed feeders, and in summer lay up large stores of grain for winter use. These species are spread along the whole of the Mediterranean coasts, but are unknown in more northern climates. Hence writers who were ignorant of ants beyond those of their own countries have been presumptuous  enough to deny the accuracy of Solomon's statement" ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 320). The Mishna, section 'Zeraim,' also contains a curious piece of legislation which bears testimony to the storing properties of the ant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9-Vers. 9-11</span> contain a call to the sluggard to rouse himself from his lethargy, and the warning of the evil consequences if he remains heedless of the reproof. <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?</span> It is the same as if it were said, "What infatuation is this which makes you lie and sleep as if you had nothing else to do?" The double question stigmatizes the sluggard's utter indolence, and suggests the picture of his prolonging his stay in bed long after every one else is abroad and about his business. <span class="accented">How long</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ad-matha</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">usquequo</span>); literally, <span class="accented">till when</span>? <span class="cmt_word">When</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">matha</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">quando.</span> The came words are used in the same order in introducing a question in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a>, "For how long will the journey be? and when wilt thou return?" <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou...  sleep.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">tish'kar</span> is literally "wilt thou lie," but the verb easily passes to the secondary meaning of "to sleep." The delineation of the sluggard is again drawn in <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-34</a> in almost identical language, but with some additions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet a Little sleep,</span> etc. Is this the answer of the sluggard which the teacher takes up and repeats ironically, and in a tone of contempt? or is it the teacher's own language describing how the sluggard slides on insensibly to ruin? The Vulgate favours the latter view, "Thou shalt sleep a little, thou shalt slumber a little, thou shalt fold thy hands to sleep, and then," etc. Habits, as Aristotle in his 'Ethics' has shown, are the resultant of repeated acts, and habits entail consequences. So here the inspired teacher would have it learnt, from the example of the sluggard, that the self-indulgence which he craves leads on to a confirmed indolence, which in the end leaves him powerless. "Yet a little" is the phrase on the lips of every one who makes but a feeble resistance, and yields supinely to his darling vice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-11.htm">Proverbs 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</span> The inevitable consequences of sloth - <span class="accented">poverty</span> and <span class="accented">want</span>, two terms conveying the idea of utter destitution - are described under a twofold aspect: first, as certain; second, as irresistible. Poverty will advance upon the sluggard with the unerring precision and swiftness with which a traveller tends towards the end of his journey, or, as Michaelis puts it, "quasi viator qui impigre pergit ac proprius venit donec propositum itineris scopum contingat" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores'). Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, keeping to the figure, however, explains differently, "Poverty shall overtake thee, as a swift traveller does one who walks slowly." The Authorized Version, "as one that travelleth," correctly represents the original <span class="accented">kim'hallek.</span> There is no ground whatever, from the use of the verb, for rendering the piel participle <span class="accented">m'hallek</span> as "a robber." The verb <span class="accented">halak</span> invariably means "to go, or walk," and the piel or intensive form of the verb means "to walk vigorously, or quickly." The participle can only mean this in the two other passages where it occurs - <a href="../../par/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> and <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:14</a>. The substantive <span class="accented">helek</span> in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-4.htm">2 Samuel 12:4</a> also signifies "a traveller." So the Vulgate here, <span class="accented">quasi viator.</span> The other view, it is stated, is required by the parallel expression in the second hemistich, "as an armed man," and receives some support from the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "as an evil traveller," which may mean either a traveller bringing evil news, or one who wanders about with an evil intention and purpose, in the sense of the Latin <span class="accented">grassator</span>, "a highwayman." In this case the meaning would be that poverty shall come upon the sluggard as he is indulging in his sloth, and leave him destitute as if stripped by a robber. But the destitution of the sluggard wilt not only be certain and swift, it will be also irresistible. His want shall come upon him as <span class="accented">an armed man</span> (<span class="accented">k'ish magen</span>); literally, as <span class="accented">a man of a shield</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi vir armatus</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> like one fully equipped, and who attacks his foe with such onset and force that against him resistance is useless. As the unarmed, unprepared man succumbs to such an opponent, so shall the sluggard fall before want. The expressions," <span class="accented">thy</span> poverty" and "<span class="accented">thy</span> want," represent the destitution of the sluggard as flowing directly from his own habit of self-indulgence. It is his in a special manner) and he, not others, is alone responsible for it. Compare, beside the parallel passage <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>, the similar teaching in ch. 10:4; 13:4; 20:4. The Vulgate, LXX., and Arabic Versions at the close of this verse add, "But if thou art diligent, the harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee;" the LXX. making a further addition, "as a bad runner (<span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)." It is observable, in comparing this section with the preceding, that the teacher pursues the subject of the sluggard to its close, while he leaves the end of the surety undetermined. The explanation may be in the difference in character of the two. The surety may escape the consequences of his act, but there is no such relief for the sluggard. His slothfulness becomes a habit, which increases the more  it is indulged in, and leads to consequences which are as irremediable as they are inevitable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - 11. <span class="accented">Eleventh admonitory discourse. Warning against mischievousness as a thing hateful to God.</span> The connection of this with the preceding discourse is not at first sight very clear, but it may be found in the fact, attested only too unhappily by experience, that sloth leads those who indulge in it to such vices as are next enumerated. The sluggard may develop into a treacherous and deceitful man, and even if such should not happen, the characteristics of the two are nearly allied, and their end is much the same. St. Paul, in his First Epistle to Timothy, observes this same combination of character, and remarks that idlers are "tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not" (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). The intention of the discourse is obviously to dissuade all, and especially the young, from the vices, and to preserve them from the ruin, of those men of whom "the naughty person and wicked man" is the type. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</span> The teacher begins by stating in general terms the nature and character of the man whom he now holds up as a warning to others, and then proceeds to point out the various features in his conduct and behaviour by which he may be known. In concise terms he is described as "a naughty person, a wicked man." This is pre-eminently his character, and the first feature in it is that his life is one of wilful and injurious misreprescntation of the truth. <span class="accented">A naughty person, a wicked man.</span> In apposition and mutually explanatory. The grammatical arrangement of the sentences which follow, each of which is introduced by a participle, and is thus coordinate to the ethers, as well as the parallel terms, "person" (<span class="accented">adam</span>) and "man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>), determine this apposition. So Bertheau and Delitzsch. Others (as Zockler, Noyes, Kamph), however, connect the second expression with the series of characteristics which follow, and render, "A worthless person is a deceiver, who," etc., but wrongly. <span class="accented">A naughty person</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">adam b'liyyaal</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of Belial</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">homo apostata</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. The word "Belial" is derived from <span class="accented">b'li</span>, "without," and <span class="accented">yaal</span>, "profit" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without profit"), or from <span class="accented">b'li</span> and <span class="accented">ol</span>, "yoke" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without yoke"), and strictly signifies either a worthless or a lawless person. The latter derivation is, however, rejected by Gesenius and others. Its abstract signification is worthlessness, uselessness; its concrete or adjectival, worthless. The word "naughty" (Anglo-Saxon, <span class="accented">naht, ne aht</span>, "not anything," equivalent to "nothing"), in the sense of good-for-nothing, ne'er-do-well, adopted in the Authorized Version, exactly reproduces its strict etymological meaning. The word, however, always carries with it the idea of moral turpitude. In the present instance its meaning is determined by the appositional phrase, "a man of iniquity," or "a wicked man," and such iniquity as takes the form of mischief making, deceit, and sowing discord among brethren. The "man of Belial" is not therefore simply, as its etymological derivation would imply, a worthless individual, one who is of no use either to himself or to the community at large, but a positively wicked, iniquitous, and despicable character. The meaning of the word varies in other passages. Thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>, where it first occurs, it is used to designate those who have fallen sway into idolatry, and induce others to follow their example. In this sense it corresponds with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">apostata, as</span> signifying a defection from the worship of the true God. Again, in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a> it is applied to the profanation of sacred places. When Hannah is accused by Eli of drunkenness in God's house at Shiloh, she replies, "Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial." In the historical books (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Judges, 1 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles), where it is of frequent occurrence, it has the general meaning of "wickedness," under whatever form it appears. So in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/41-8.htm">Psalm 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a>) and Nahum (<a href="../../par/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11, 15</a>). In the Book of Job (<a href="../../par/job/34-18.htm">Job 34:18</a>, once only) it is used adjectively and as a term of reproach, "Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked [<span class="accented">b'liyyaal</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'worthless']?" Individuals possessing the qualities of worthlessness, profanity, or wickedness are designated in Holy Scripture either as "sons," "children," "daughters," or "men of Belial." The word only occurs in two other passages in the Proverbs - <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a> and Proverbs 19:28. In the New Testament (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>) the word "Belial" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>) appears as an appellative of Satan, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, "the evil one," as the representative of all that is bad, and as antichrist. <span class="accented">A wicked man</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ish aven</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of vanity</span> or <span class="accented">iniquity</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">vir inutilis</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The radical idea of <span class="accented">aven</span> (from <span class="accented">un</span>, "nothing") is that of emptiness or vanity, and has much, therefore, in common with <span class="accented">b'liyaal.</span> Its secondary  meaning, and that which it usually bears in Scripture, is iniquity. "A man of iniquity" is one who is altogether deficient in moral consciousness, and who goes about to work wickedness and do hurt and injury to others (cf. ver. 18 and <a href="../../par/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). <span class="accented">Walketh with a froward mouth.</span> His first characteristic, as already observed. His whole life and conduct are marked by craftiness, deceit, perversion, and misrepresentation, and an utter want of truth. "Walking" is here, as elsewhere in Scripture, used of some particular course of conduct. So we find the LXX. paraphrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>. "he enters or walks not in good ways." <span class="accented">With a froward mouth</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ik'shuth peh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">with perversity of mouth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ore perverse.</span> Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "with perversity of mouth." The mouth, or speech, is the vehicle by which this person gives outward expression to the evil thoughts which are inwardly filling his heart. The phrase occurs before in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>. The meaning of the passage is well illustrated in <a href="../../par/psalms/10-7.htm">Psalm 10:7</a>, "His mouth is full of misery, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity."

"Teaching" is only the secondary meaning of the Hebrew participle <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which is here used. The verb <span class="accented">yarah</span>, to which it belongs, means properly to extend or stretch out the hand for the purpose of pointing out the way (compare the Hebrew <span class="accented">shalakh yod</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">monstrare</span>), and hence came to mean "to teach." The crafty and deceitful character which is here <span class="accented">presented to as</span> is strikingly reproduced in Ecclesiasticus: "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him" (Ecclus. 27:22-24). The heathen poet Naevius says of the impudent woman - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Allium tenet, alii adnutat, alibi manus<br />Est occupata: est alii percellit pedem."</span> Compare also Ovid's words ('Amor.,' 1:4, 16) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Clam mihi tange pedem:<br />Me specta, mutusque meos, vultumque loquacem...<br />Verba superciliis sine voce loquentia dicam;<br />Verba leges digitis."</span> So Tibullus, 1:12 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Illa viro coram nutus conferre loquaces<br />Blandaque compositis abdere verba notis."</span> The lesson which we may learn from this verse is not to abuse the members of our bodies, by employing them for the purposes of deceit and hypocrisy, and so to promote evil, but to put them to their natural and legitimate use. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - From these external features the teacher passes to the heart the seat of all this mischief and deceit. In this respect we observe a striking correspondence with the method adopted by our Saviour in his leaching, who referred everything to the heart, as the true seat of all that was good or bad in man. <span class="cmt_word">Frowardness is in his heart</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">tah'pukoth b'libbo</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his heart is full of perverse imaginations, it is there he nourishes his jealousy, his hatred, his malice, his ill will. It is there, too, <span class="cmt_word">he deviseth mischief continually.</span> "Devising mischief" carries us one step further back in the history of evil. It is this feature, this deliberate premeditation to plot mischief and to devise means to carry it into execution, which makes the character of the man simply diabolical. He makes his heart as it were the workshop wherein he fabricates and prepares his villainy. The Hebrew <span class="accented">kharash</span> (to which the participle <span class="accented">khoresh</span> belongs) is equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">machinari</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to fabricate, devise, plot." (See <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a> and ver. 18; and cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>, "He deviseth mischief upon his bed.") The LXX. combines the two statements in one proposition: "A perverse heart deviseth evil at all  times." Similarly the Vulgate, which, however, joins "continually" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'koleth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">omni tempore</span>) to the second hemistich, thus: "And at all times he sows discord (<span class="accented">et omni tempore jurgia seminat</span>)." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He soweth discord</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mid'-yanim</span> (Keri) <span class="accented">y'shalleakh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">he sends forth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> excites) <span class="accented">strife</span>; or, as the margin, <span class="accented">he casteth forth strife.</span> The Keri reading <span class="accented">mid'yanim</span>, for the Khetib <span class="accented">m'danim</span>, is probably, as Hitzig suggests, derived from <a href="../../par/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. The phrase occurs again as <span class="accented">shallakh m'danim</span> in ver. 19, and as <span class="accented">shillakh madon</span> <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>). This is the culminating point in the character of the wicked man. He takes delight in breaking up friendship and in destroying concord among brethren (see ver. 19), and thus destroys one of the most essential elements for promoting individual happiness and the welfare of the community at large. This idea of the community is introduced into the LXX., which reads, "Such an one brings disturbance to the city (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." The motive cause may be either malice or self-interest.

It is a destruction that shall break him up. <span class="accented">Without remedy</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">v'eyn mar'pe</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there is no remedy.</span> There shall be, as Fleischer, as it were, no means of recovery for his shattered members.

The idea seems to be taken from the shattered fragments of a potter's vessel, which it is impossible to reunite. So in the case of the man whose life has been one of fraud, deceit, and malice, there is for him no hope of any recovery. The language may seem exaggerated, but the picture is painted with this high colouring to exhibit a strong deterrent to such a line of conduct, and further, it may be remarked that, in the present day, only the most confiding would again put trust in a man who has wilfully and maliciously deceived them (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>). The second hemistich of this verse occurs again <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a></div><div class="verse">These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The whole structure and arrangement of the thoughts which occur in vers. 16-19 clearly show that this is not an independent section, but one closely allied to that which has just preceded. The object is to show that those evil qualities of deceit and malice which are disastrous to man are equally odious in the sight of Jehovah, and consequently within the scope of the Divine displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him.</span> The use of the numerical proverb, though common to the gnomic literature of Persia and Arabia, as Umbreit shows, is by our author confined to this single instance. Other examples occur in our book in the words of Agur the son of Jakeh (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9, 24-28</a>), and the midda, the name given by later Jewish writers to this form of proverb, is observable in the ape-cryphal Book of Ecclesiasticus (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-16.htm">Proverbs 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a> and Proverbs 26:5-28). When, as in the present instance, two numbers are given, the larger number corresponds with the things enumerated. So in <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>. In <a href="../../par/amos/1.htm">Amos 1</a> and 2, however, there is an exception to this rule, where the numbers appear to be used indefinitely. As to the origin of the numerical proverb, the most probable explanation is that given by Hitzig and adopted by Zockler, namely, that it is due to the exigencies of parallelism. The author first adopts one number optionally, and then a second is employed as a parallel to it. Here, however, the number determined on in the writer's mind is the larger number seven, and the smaller number six is used as a rhetorical parallel. An examination of the following verses will show that the seven exactly measures the things which are described as odious to the Lord. The Authorized Version, so far as the numbers are concerned, exactly represents the original, which, by the use of the cardinal number "seven" (<span class="accented">sheva</span>), and not the ordinal "seventh," which would be <span class="accented">sh'vii</span>, shows that the things enumerated are equally an abomination in God's sight. The view  therefore, that the seventh vice is odious to God in an especial degree above the others, is untenable, though it has found defenders in Lowenstein, Bertheau, and von Gerlach, and is supported by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sex sunt quae odit Dominus, et septimum detestatur anima ejus.</span> All the seven things are execrable, all are equally objects of the Divine abhorrence. Besides, we cannot imagine that the vice of sowing discord among brethren, of ver. 19, is more odious to God than the crime of shedding innocent blood of ver. 17. <span class="accented">Unto him</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">naph'sho</span>); literally, <span class="accented">of his soul.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a></div><div class="verse">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The enumeration begins with <span class="accented">pride. <span class="cmt_word"></span>A proud look</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">eynayim ramoth</span>); literally, <span class="accented">haughty or lofty eyes</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">oculos sublimes</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is not merely the look which is meant, but the temper of mind which the look expresses (Wardlaw). The lofty look is the indication of the swelling pride which fills the heart, the <span class="accented">mentis elatae tumor</span>, the supreme disdain, <span class="accented">grande supercilium</span>, for everything and everybody. Pride is put first, because it is at the bottom of all disobedience and rebellion against God's laws. It is the very opposite of humility, which the apostle, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, mentions as the basis, as it were, of all the virtues. All pride is intended, and the face of the Lord is against this pride. He "resisteth the proud;" he "knoweth them afar off;" he "hath respect unto the lowly;" he "will bring down high looks" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>); he judgeth those that are high (<a href="../../par/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>). It is against this spirit that Job prays Jehovah "to behold every one that is proud, and abase him," and "to look upon every one that is proud, and bring him low" (<a href="../../par/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11, 12</a>). The next thing in the enumeration is a lying tongue. Lying is hateful to God, because he is the God of truth. In a concise form the expression, "a lying tongue," represents what has been already said in vers. 12 and 13 of "the wicked man" who "walks with a froward mouth," and whose conduct is made up of deceit. Lying is the wilful perversion of truth, not only by speech, but by any means whatever whereby a false impression is conveyed to the mind. The liar "sticks not at any lies, flatteries, or calumnies" (Patrick). Lying is elsewhere denounced as the subject which excites the Divine displeasure (see <a href="../../par/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8, 27</a>); and in the early Christian Church, in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, it was punished with death. On the subject of lying, see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' c. 18, wherein he says, "Mihi autem videtur peccatum quidem esse omne mendacium." Every lie is a sin. The third thing is <span class="cmt_word">hands that shed innocent blood,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a murderous and cruel disposition, which, rather than have its plans frustrated, will imbue the hands with innocent blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the blood of those who have done it no injury. The Divine command is, "Thou shall do no murder," and those who break it will find, even if they escape man, that the Lord is "the avenger of blood," and that he "maketh inquisition" for it (cf. ch. 1. and 2, and <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, which bear a close resemblance to this passage). That the shedding of innocent blood cues for vengeance, and pulls down God's heavy judgments on the murderer, appears in the case of Cain and Abel (Muffet). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-18.htm">Proverbs 6:18</a></div><div class="verse">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The fourth thing is <span class="cmt_word">an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations.</span> "Wicked imaginations" are literally "thoughts of iniquity;" Hebrew, <span class="accented">makh'sh'voth aven</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">cogitationes pessimas</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>. The same expression in <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a> is rendered "thoughts of iniquity." (On <span class="accented">deviseth</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">khoresh</span>, see ver. 14 and ch. 3:29.) The thought is a repetition of ver. 14<span class="accented">a</span>. There are evil thoughts in all men's hearts; but the devising, fabricating of them, and thus making the heart into a devil's workshop, is the mark of utter depravity and wickedness, and is abhorrent to God. The devices of the heart, though planned in secret, are clear to him "to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are bid." The peculiar position which the heart occupies in the enumeration is to be accounted for on the ground that it is the fountain, not only of those vices which have been already mentioned, but of those which follow. The fifth thing is <span class="cmt_word">feet that be swift in running to mischief.</span> Again we are reminded of <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, "Their feet run to evil." "Mischief" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is a re-echo of ver. 14 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a>. "To run to mischief" is to carry out with alacrity and without delay what has already been devised in the heart. It implies more than falling or sliding into sin, which is common to all. It denotes, Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "inexplebilem sceleris aviditatem, et destinatum studium." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a></div><div class="verse">A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The sixth thing is <span class="accented">perjury. <span class="cmt_word"></span>A false witness that speaketh lies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he that breathes out, or utters, lies as a false witness.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">proferentem mendacia testem fallacem.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">puakh</span> is "to breathe," "to blow," and in the hiph. form, which is used here (<span class="accented">yaphiakh</span>, hiph. future), it is "to blow out" or" utter," either in a bad sense, as in the present instance, and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-5.htm">Proverbs 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-5.htm">Proverbs 19:5, 9</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>); or in a good sense, "to utter the truth," as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>. <span class="accented">Lies</span>; Hebrew <span class="accented">k'zavim</span>, plural of <span class="accented">kazav</span>,  "falsehood," "lying" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-25.htm">Proverbs 21:25</a>). <span class="accented">A false witness</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ed-k'zavim</span>), as in margin, "a witness of lies." The expression, "as a false witness," as it appears in the original, is explanatory, and indicates the particular aspect under which the speaking of lies is regarded. Lying in its more general sense has been already spoken of in ver. 17. The vice which is here noted as odious to God is expressly forbidden in the moral code, "Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). But this, though the chief, is only one view of the case. Perjury may be employed, not only in ruining the innocent, but also in screen-tog the guilty. "Much hurt," says Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, "doth the deceitful and lying witness, for he corrupteth the judge, oppresseth the innocent, suppresseth the truth, and in the courts of justice sinneth against his own soul and the Lord himself most grievously." "He that speaketh lies as a false witness," again, may be the vile instrument in the hands of unscrupulous and inexorable enemies, as those employed against our Lord and Stephen. Perjury, too, destroys the security of communities. The shipwreck of society which it occasions may be seen in the frightful misery which ensued when the system of <span class="accented">delatores</span> was not only countenanced, but encouraged under the Roman empire. Truly speaking, he that lies as a false witness must be hateful to God. And he that soweth discord among brethren; the seventh and last thing in the enumeration, but not, as Delitzsch holds, the <span class="accented">ne plus ultra</span> of all that is hated of God. It closes, as in ver. 14, the series, but with the addition "among brethren;" thus emphatically stigmatizing the conduct of that man as diabolical who destroys the harmony and unity of those who ought to live together in brotherly affection, and who disturbs the peace of communities.

The extreme tendency of men, and especially young men, to sins of impurity is no doubt, as Delitzsch remarks, the reason why this subject is again resumed. The subject is gradually worked up to the preceding admonitions in vers. 20-23, pointing out that the way of life, the way of safety, is to be secured by obedience to the precepts of parents, whose commandment and law illumine the perilous road of life, and whose reproofs are salutary to the soul. The arguments against the sin of adultery are cogent in their dissuasiveness, and none stronger of a purely temporal nature could be devised. It may be objected that the sin is not put forward in the higher light, as an offence before God. and that the appeal is made simply on the lines of self-interest; but who will deny that the scope of the teaching is distinctly moral, or that mankind is not influenced and dissuaded from sin by such a category of evils as includes personal beggary, dishonour, and death? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The first part of this verse is couched in almost the same terms as that of <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, except that <span class="accented">mitz'rath</span>, "precept," <span class="accented">preceptum</span>, is here used instead of <span class="accented">musar, eruditio</span>, or "disciplinary instruction," while the latter part of the two verses are identical.

The "tying about" the neck may suggest the use of amulets, an Oriental custom, to ward off evil, but it is more likely that it refers to the wearing of ornaments. <span class="cmt_word">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">commandment</span> and <span class="accented">law</span> of father and mother respectively, expressed in the Hebrew by the suffix -<span class="accented">em</span>, in the verb <span class="accented">kosh'rem</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">liga ea</span>, and again in <span class="accented">ondem</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">vinci ea.</span> (For the personal use of this figure, see <a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Tie them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">ondem.</span> The verb <span class="accented">anad</span>, "to tie," only occurs twice as a verb - here and in <a href="../../par/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>. Lee prefers "to bind;" Delitzsch, however, states that it is equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">circumplicare</span>, "to wind about." The meaning of this and similar passages (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>) is that the commandment, precept, law, or whatever is intended, should be always present to the mind.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a></div><div class="verse">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The going, sleeping, and awaking occur in the same order in the Pentateuch, from which the ideas of this and the preceding verse are evidently derived (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> and Deuteronomy 11:19). Though only specifying three conditions, they refer to the whole conduct of life, and hence the verse promises direction, guardianship, and converse of wisdom, which will undoubtedly attend life where the precepts of parents are lovingly treasured and obediently observed. The Authorized Version conveys the impression that it is "the keeping" of the parents' precepts, etc., which is to bear such results; but it is better to  understand "it" as signifying the whole teaching or doctrine of wisdom, as Delitzsch. Wisdom becomes personified in the representation, and identified with her teaching. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">lead thee.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">nakhah</span>, "to lead," in the sense of "to direct," like the Latin <span class="accented">dirigere</span> (Delitzsch), and as it is used in Exodus and Numbers, <span class="accented">passim.</span> In the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, etc.) it is employed of God as governing men. Hence, in the affairs of life, Wisdom will so guide and control us that we shall act uprightly. There is the further notion imported into the word of preservation from evil (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>, "Thou shalt walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble"). <span class="cmt_word">When thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">sleepest;</span> or, <span class="accented">when thou liest down</span>, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, where the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">It shall keep thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch over, keep safe, or preserve; as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">custodire</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. We have had the same verb, <span class="accented">shamar</span>, before in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>. Wisdom will be as it were a guardian angel in our hours of repose. <span class="cmt_word">When thou awakest</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">hakitsotha</span>, the hiph. perfect of <span class="accented">kutz.</span> This word only occurs here. The hiph. form, <span class="accented">hekitz</span>, is intransitive, "to be aroused" (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It shall talk with thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she.</span> Bertheau renders, "She will make thee thoughtful;" and Dathe, "Let them be thy meditation;" but the accusative suffix designates the person who is the object of the action of the verb, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> (Zockler) and as Delitzseh remarks, the personification requires something more than a mere meditation with one's self on the precepts of Wisdom. Wisdom herself shall hold converse with thee (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), she shall suggest thoughts how thou art to behave thyself. The meaning of the verb, "to meditate," "to think deeply," however, need not be lost sight of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a></div><div class="verse">For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light.</span> The teacher takes up the words "commandment" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mitzrah</span>) and "law" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">torah</span>) from ver. 20, which he describes respectively as "a lamp" and "light" The "commandment" is any special or particular commandment which harmonizes with God's will, and commands what is to be done and forbids what is to be left undone. The "law" is the whole law of God in its entirety; not here the Law of Moses technically, but the whole system of generalized instruction; They stand, therefore, in the same relation to each other as "a lamp" and "light," the one being particular, and the other general. "Light" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">or</span>) is light in general, as the light of the day and the sun, while "a lamp" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ner</span>, from <span class="accented">nur</span>, "to shine) is a particular light like that of a candle, which is enkindled at some other source. The "commandment" and the "law" alike enlighten the conscience and enable one to walk in his way of life. On this passage Le Clerc remarks, "Ut in tenebris lucerna, aut fax ostendit nobis, qua eundam sit: in ignorantiae humanae caligine, quae nos per hanc totam vitam cingit, revelatio divina nos docet, quid sit faciendum, quid vitandum." So the psalmist says in <a href="../../par/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>, "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;" and again in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they direct and show the true way of faith and life (Gejerus). The "commandment" and the "law" may stand for the whole revelation of God without reference to any particular precept (as Scott), but they have here a specific bearing on a particular form of human conduct, as appears from the following verses. <span class="cmt_word">And reproofs of instruction are the way of life.</span> <span class="accented">Reproofs of instruction</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">tok'khoth musar</span>, disciplinary reproofs, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reproofs whose object is the discipline of the soul and the moral elevation of the character. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; thus connecting it with education in its highest sense. Such reproofs are a way of life (Hebrew, <span class="accented">derek khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> they lead to life; they conduce to the prolongation of life. This view of the subject, so prominent in the mind of the teacher in other passages (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a> and 19), must not be lost sight of, though the words are susceptible of another interpretation, as indicating that the severest reproofs, inasmuch as they correct errors and require obedience, conduce to the greatest happiness (Patrick). Or again, it may mean that disciplinary reproofs are necessary to life. The soul to arrive at perfection must undergo them as part of the conditions of its existence, and, consequently, they are to be submitted to with the consciousness that, however irksome they may be, they are imposed for its eventual benefit (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>). But this interpretation is unlikely from what follows.

The "commandment" and the "law" illuminate the path of true life generally, but in a special degree they, if attended to, will guard the young against sins of impurity, fornication, and adultery. <span class="accented">The evil woman</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">esheth ra</span>); strictly, <span class="accented">a woman of evil</span>, or vileness, or of a wicked disposition, addicted to evil in an extraordinary degree; <span class="accented">ra</span> being here a substantive standing in a genitive relation to <span class="accented">esheth, as</span> in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, "The way of evil (<span class="accented">derek ra</span>)." Cf. also <span class="accented">tah'pukoth ra, perverstates mali</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/2-14.htm">Proverbs 2:14</a>), and <span class="accented">makh'sh'voth ra, cogitationes mali</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>), and <span class="accented">an'shey</span>  <span class="accented">ra</span>, <span class="accented">viri mali</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>).

Zockler, however, proposes an emendation of the Masoretic text, and substitutes the construct case, <span class="accented">l'shon</span>, for the absolute, <span class="accented">lashon</span>, rendering as in the Authorized Version, on the ground that the emphasis lies, not on the "tongue," which would be the case if we render "of a strange tongue," but on "the strange woman," who is the subject of the discourse, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a> and Proverbs 5:20. But <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> is feminine of the adjective <span class="accented">nok'ri</span>, ann in agreement with <span class="accented">lashon</span>, which, though common, is more frequently feminine (Gesenius), and hence the two words may stand in agreement. The marginal reading is to be preferred (Wordsworth). Again, <span class="accented">me</span>-<span class="accented">khel'kath</span>, the construct ease of <span class="accented">khel'kah</span>, literally, "smoothness," and metaphorically flattery, with the prefix <span class="accented">me</span>, forms one member of the phrase, while the compound expression, <span class="accented">lashon nok'riyyah</span>, forms the second. Ewald and Bertheau render, "from the smooth-tongued, the strange woman," thus connecting <span class="accented">mekhel'kath lashon</span>, and regarding <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> as a separate and distinct idea. They agree with Symmachus and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from the smooth-tongued or flattering stranger." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">blanda lingua extraneae, i.e.</span> from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. The LXX. again favours the marginal reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the slander of a strange tongue." So the Chaldee Paraphrase. The Syriac reads, "from the accusation of a woman of a strange tongue," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who uses a foreign language. If, however, the Authorized Version be retained, the Hebrew <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> will, as in other passages, mean "an adulteress" (Gesenius); <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>. Under any circumstances, we have here attributed to the tongue what, in fact, belongs to the woman. It is against the enticements and blandishments of a woman of depraved moral character that the "commandment" and "law" form a safeguard to youth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart</span>. The admonition of this verse embraces the two sides of the subject - the external allurement and the internal predisposition to vice. <span class="accented">Lust not after</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">al-takh'mod</span>); strictly, <span class="accented">desire not</span>, since the verb <span class="accented">khamad</span> is properly" to desire, or covet." The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, "Thou shalt not <span class="accented">covet</span> thy neighbour's wife," and <a href="../../par/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>, "Neither shall any man <span class="accented">desire</span> thy land" (cf. <a href="../../par/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-12.htm">Proverbs 12:12</a>). In <a href="../../par/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, it has the sense of <span class="accented">taking delight</span> in anything. It may be questioned whether it ever has the strong meaning given in the Vulgate (<span class="accented">non concupiscat</span>) and adopted in the Authorized Version, "to lust after" (Holden). Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus render <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>. The use of <span class="accented">khamad</span> here reveals the warning of the Decalogue. <span class="accented">In thine heart</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">bil'va-veka</span>. corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of <a href="../../par/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>. The admonition is a warning to repress the very first inclinations to unchaste desires. They may be unobserved and undetected by ethers, but they are known to ourselves, and the first duty of repressing them calls for an act of determination and will on our part. Our Lord teaches (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, cited above), "That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." The LXX. reading is <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "Let not the desire of beauty conquer thee." <span class="cmt_word">Neither let her take thee with her eyelids;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not let her captivate thee with her amorous glances. <span class="accented">Take.</span> The Hebrew verb, <span class="accented">lakakh</span>, is "to captivate" with blandishments, "to allure, beguile" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="accented">With her eyelids</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'aph'appeyah</span>); or perhaps more literally, <span class="accented">with her eyelashes</span> (Zockler). The eyelids; Hebrew, <span class="accented">aph'appayim</span>, dual of <span class="accented">aph'aph</span>, so called from their rapid, volatile motion, are here compared with <span class="accented">nets</span>, as by Philostratus ('Epistles:' <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>), who speaks of "the nets of the eyes (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>)." The eyelids are the instruments by which the amorous woman beguiles or catches her victims. She allures him by her glances. So St. Jerome says, "The eye of an harlot is the snare of her lover." The wanton glance is expressed in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">nutibus illius</span>; cf. "The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids" (Ecclus. 26:9). Milton ('Paradise Lost,' 11:620) speaks of the daughters of men "rolling the eye," amongst other things, in order to captivate the sons of God. Piscator and Mercerus understand the eyelids as standing metonymically for the beauty of the eye; and Bayne, for the general adornment of the head in order to attract attention. Allusion may possibly be made to the custom of Eastern women painting the eyelids to give brilliancy and expression; cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a> (Wordsworth). A striking parallel to the <span class="accented">verse</span> before us occurs in Propertius, lib. 1. 'Eleg.' 1., "Cynthia prima suis miserum me cepit ocellis."

The LXX. and Vulgate singularly render, "For the price of a harlot is scarcely that of a bit of bread," which may mean, as Castalio, that she is of so little value; but the context is opposed to this rendering, where the Point brought out is not the vile character of the harlot as the ruin she inflicts or is the cause cf. Besides, the Hebrew <span class="accented">ad</span> does not mean ever "scarcely," or "hardly," which the Vulgate <span class="accented">vix<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> gives to it. <span class="cmt_word">And the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</span> The adulteress is <span class="accented">isheth ish</span>, literally, "the woman of a man," or "a man's wife," as in the margin - as, therefore, strictly an adulteress here (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). <span class="accented">Will hunt</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">thatsud</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">capit.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">tsud</span>, "to lie in wait for," "to hunt," also signifies "to take, or capture," like the Vulgate <span class="accented">capere</span>, The verb in its metaphorical use also occurs in <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a>, and refers to those beguilements resorted to by the adulteress to seduce youth. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a> it carries with it the idea of death, and if understood in this sense here it may have reference to the death penalty inflicted on adulterer and adulteress by the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>), and introduces what is said more fully in vers. 32, 34, 35. <span class="accented">The precious life</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">nephesh y'karah</span> The epithet <span class="accented">y'karah</span> is appropriately added to <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, as indicating the high value of the life. All is implied in the <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "the life," moral dignity of character, the soul of man. It is the ever-existing part of the man, and therefore is precious - nothing can exceed it in value. Our Lord says (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>), "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" and the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>), "For the redemption of their life is precious." But it is for this life, or soul, that the adulteress hunts, and which she destroys. Lives of fornication and adultery, therefore, carry with them the severest penalties, the loss of temporal possessions, for the enjoyment of a transient passion, and far beyond this the loss of life both temporal and eternal. We cannot imagine a more deterrent warning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a></div><div class="verse">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - In this and the two following verses (28 and 29) the discourse proceeds from statement to illustration, and by examples of cause and effect the teacher shows "the moral necessity of the evil consequences of the sin of adultery" (Delitzsch). The meaning of the verses is plain enough, viz. that as it is in vain to suppose that a person's garment will not be burnt or his feet not be scorched if fire is brought near them, so it is equally inconceivable that a person indulging in adultery can escape its consequences or the retribution that follows. The two questions in vers. 27 and 28 imply a strong negative, and so prepare for the conclusion in ver. 30. <span class="accented">Take fire.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">khathah</span> signifies "<span class="accented">to take</span> burning or live coals <span class="accented">from the hearth"</span> (Placater); and hence is used here in a pregnant sense "to take from the hearth and place in" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>, "For thou wilt take coals ['and heap them:' Hebrew, <span class="accented">gekhalim khotheh</span>] on his head"). The fuller expression is met with in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>, "So that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth (<span class="accented">lakh'toth esh miyyakud</span>).'" The Vulgate renders by <span class="accented">abscondere</span>," to hide: <span class="accented">Numquid potest homo absconders ignem</span>; and the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">alligare</span> "to tie or bind fast."

The  word <span class="accented">kheyk</span> is properly "an undulation" (Delitzsch). not the <span class="accented">lap</span>, but as in the Authorized Version here, "the bosom," and "the bosom of a garment" as in ch. 16:33; 17:23; 21:14. The answer to the question of this and the next verse is of course a decided negative, but we may note that the teacher compares adultery to a burning fire in its consequences.

The flames of lust will certainly be visited with punishment, and with the stings of conscience. Job, speaking on this very subject, says a deviation from the paths of virtue "is a fire that consumeth to destruction." And to him who gives way to adultery it may be said, in the words of Horace, though with a different application from that in which they were used by that poet, "incedis per ignes suppositos cineri doloso." "You are walking over fire that lies hidden under deceitful ashes" (Gejerus).

The verb <span class="accented">nakah</span> signifies rimarily "to be pure;" Bothe Vulgate tenders <span class="accented">non erit mundus</span>," he will not be pure;" but the LXX. observes the secondary meaning of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">non erit innoxius</span>, "he shall not be let go unpunished," the Alexandrine verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>. Certain and the very heaviest punishment shall come upon him (see also <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>). With this explanation agree Gejerus and Vatablus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The teacher continues his argument with another illustration, still keeping in view his object, which is to show that the punishment of the adulterer is a surely impending one and severe in its character. The argument in vers. 30-33 is one <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>. If men do not overlook but severely punish a crime which has been committed under extenuating circumstances, much less will they do so where the crime is of a much graver character and has nothing to excuse it. Theft and adultery are brought into comparison. Theft under all circumstances is a lesser crime than adultery, but here it is minimized to the lowest degree. The case of a man is taken who steals to satisfy his hunger; the extent of the theft cannot be large, but yet he is punished, and called upon to make the amplest restitution. Much more, does the teacher infer, will be the punishment, and equally certain, where adultery is in question, and the crime is of the most heinous character affecting the most precious interests, and indulged in from the lowest of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Men do not despise a thief,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not condemn him under the circumstances, <span class="accented">non grandis est culpa</span> (Vulgate), "the fault is not a great one;" but they do despise an adulterer - him they hold in contempt as one "who lacketh understanding" and destroyeth his own soul (ver. 32). The verb <span class="accented">buz</span> has, however, been otherwise rendered as "to overlook." Zockler and Holden explain, "men do not overlook," though the former gives the literal sense as "men do not despise." Gesenius renders "despise," but explains, "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not let him go unpunished." Vatablus, the Versions, Ariae, Montani, and Munsteri, Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Gesenius, Stuart, Muenscher, and Wordsworth, all agree m regarding the proper meaning of the verb to be "to despise" or "to treat scornfully." The verb <span class="accented">buz</span>, moreover, occurs in this sense in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-9.htm">Proverbs 23:9</a>; and <a href="../../par/songs/8-1.htm">Song of Solomon 8:1, 7</a>. Michaelis's explanation is as follows: "although a theft is deservedly regarded as infamous in the commonwealth, nevertheless, if it be compared with adultery, it is less wicked." The rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "it is not a wonder if any thief be taken," it is difficult to reconcile with the text in the original, though it may be explained as expressing the certainty of arrest which follows theft, and thus gives colour to the secondary meaning attached to the verb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of overlooking. The Syriac and Arabic Versions follow the LXX. while the Chaldee Paraphrase renders, "It is not a matter of surprise if a thief steals," etc. <span class="cmt_word">His soul;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">naph'sko</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh</span> is  used here for desire, craving, or appetite, as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>.

It is therefore to be understood indefinitely of complete restitution, or, as it is expressed in the second and parallel clauses, "all the substance of his house." The word is used in this sense in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> (Lapide). Theft under the Mosaic Law was punishable by a fivefold, fourfold, and twofold restitution (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1-4, 9</a>), and, in the event of this not forthcoming, the delinquent was to be sold into slavery (Leviticus 25:89). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a> a fourfold restitution is mentioned, and in the New Testament Zacchaeus promises to restore fourfold if he could be convicted of fraud (<a href="../../par/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). In the attempts to reconcile the "sevenfold" of our passage with the requirements of the Mosaic Law, Aben Ezra says that the combined penalties for two cases of theft are contemplated, and others that in the time of the writer the penalties had been increased. But proof of this is wanting. Grotius's explanation is more curious than correct, viz. that if the theft be repeated seven times, and he be "taken" seven times, the thief should only be punished by being forced to make restitution with some addition. Both the Greek and Roman law demanded a twofold restitution. Selden maintains that theft would have been subjected to the usual punishment (Selden, 'De Jure Not. et Gent.,' 6, 100, 6). We may therefore come to the conclusion that "sevenfold" is used in the sense indicated above. As to any objection which may be raised on the seem of inconsistency in talking of a man malting restitution, and giving all his substance when he steals to satisfy his hunger, it may be remarked that he need not necessarily be without substance of some sort or other, and he could acquire subsequently sufficient to satisfy the demand. On the question whether a person is justified by extreme want in stealing, see Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pacis,' 2, 100, 2, &sect; 6; Puffendorf, 'De Jure Not. et Gent,' 2, 100, 6, &sect; 5; Blackstone, 'Commentary,' 4:2 &sect; 4.

The man who steals from hunger has a motive for so doing, but the adulterer has no such excuse for his crime, which is an unwarrantable invasion of his neighbour's rights. Because there are honest ways for satisfying his desires, he therefore "lacketh understanding." <span class="accented">Committeth adultery with a woman</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">noeph ishshah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui adulter est</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an adulterer. The Hebrew <span class="accented">naaph</span>, "to commit adultery," is here followed by an accusative, as in <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>. <span class="accented">Lacketh understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">khasar-lev</span>; <span class="accented">deficit corde</span>. The verb <span class="accented">khaser</span> is "to be devoid of anything," "to lack." The expression, which occurs again in ch. Proverbs 7:7 aud Proverbs 9:4, refers to the brutish and stupid condition to which lust has reduced him. Lust has displaced right reason. He is <span class="accented">expers judicii</span> (Syriac), devoid of judgment, without intelligence, senseless and stupid. In modern phraseology, he has taken leave of his senses. Both the LXX. and Vulgate have combined the two branches of this verse, the former rendering, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, compasses the loss of his life," and the latter, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, loses his life." <span class="cmt_word">He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul;</span> or literally, <span class="accented">whoso will destroy his life he will do this, i.e.</span> adultery. So Ariae Montani, Munsterus, Chaldee Targum. The man who commits adultery is a self-murderer. The phrase, <span class="accented">mashkith naph'sho, corrumpens animam suam</span>, may be resolved into the concrete "a self-destroyer," as Delitzsch. The following verses seem to indicate that it is the temporal life which is referred to in <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, but the meaning of the term may be extended to embrace not only physical loss of life, but also moral and spiritual loss. By the Levitical Law adultery was punished by death: "The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife ... the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4, 5</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>).

It seems clear that "a wound" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">negav</span>, "a stroke" or "blow"), used here in the singular, collectively refers to the corporal punishment, which the outraged husband will inflict upon the adulterer (Delitzsch, Zockler. Lapide). (For the word, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>;  21:5.) It may also have reference to the punishment inflicted by the Law. In the LXX. the idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pains," and so gives colour to Lapide's explanation of "afflictions of every kind" The Vulgate gives a moral turn to the meaning, and coordinates the word with "dishonour:" <span class="accented">Turpitudinem et ignominiam congregat sibi</span>, "<span class="accented">Dishonour</span> is the ignominious treatment he will receive on all hands." The second part of the verse states that a brand of disgrace will be attached to his name which will be perpetual, not confined to this life only, but extending beyond it, so that men will never recall it but with this stigma (Patrick, Mercerus). On <span class="accented">shall be ... wiped away</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">timmakeh</span>, the niph. future of <span class="accented">makhah</span>, "to wipe off, or away," and in hiph.

Thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "For the wrath of her husband filled with jealousy shall not spare in the day of judgment;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quia zelus et furor viri non parcet in die vindictae</span>, "For the jealousy and rage of a man shall not spare in the day of vengeance;" the Syriac, <span class="accented">Nam</span> <span class="accented">quia furor mariti plenus est zelotypia non parcet in die retributionis</span>, "For because rage of a husband is full of jealousy he shall not spare in the day of retribution." So the Arabic, and the Tigarina Versio, and among the commentators Durandus. Dathe, Doderlein, Holden. But the Hebrew simply makes the statement, <span class="accented">ki-kimah khamath-gaver, quia zelus excandescentia viri, i.e.</span>, as in the Authorized Version, "for jealousy is the rage of a man," <span class="accented">ki</span>, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, "for" and <span class="accented">kinah is</span> the subject of the sentence. The Hebrew <span class="accented">kinah</span> is "jealousy" as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>, "Who is able to stand before envy?" or, as margin, "jealousy." The ordinary copulative verb "is" is best understood as connecting the subject and the predicate; "the rage of a man," Hebrew <span class="accented">kamath-gaver</span>, as above, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the glow of a man's anger" (Delitzsch), or "a man's fierce anger" (Zockler). Jealousy awakens and inflames the wrath and anger of a man or husband to its highest pitch. It evokes the strongest feelings for revenge. <span class="accented">Man</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">gaver</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">ish</span>, "a man," in opposition to "a wife" - "a <span class="accented">husband</span>," as here. The word is chiefly found in poetry. Its derivation, from <span class="accented">gavar</span>, "to be strong," serves to bring out the idea also of the intensity or force of the jealousy - it burns or rages with all the might of the man. The latter part of the verse in the Hebrew is simply, "and he will not spare (<span class="accented">v'lo-yakh'mol</span>) in the day of vengeance." The Authorized Version "therefore" serves to bring out the deduction, though it does net occur in the original. <span class="accented">He will not spare</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the injured husband will not show any clemency or mercy to the adulterer, the man who has wronged him so deeply. <span class="accented">In the day of vengeance</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'yom nakam.</span> The expression may refer to the time when the adulterer is brought before the judges, but more probably to every occasion on which the husband can exercise his vengeance. So Gejerus. For the expression, cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>, "The day of the Lord's vengeance;" <a href="../../par/job/20-28.htm">Job 20:28</a>, "The day of his wrath;" and <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, "The day of wrath." Jealousy is implacable (see <a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>, "Jealousy is cruel as the grave"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35</a></div><div class="verse">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</span> No recompense or atonement, nor any gifts however great, will buy him off. These are supposed to be offered by the adulterer to the enraged husband, who, however, will never rest till he effects the utter ruin of his injurer. The literal rendering of the first hemistich is, "He will not accept the face of any ransom." The phrase <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, is equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and signifies "to give a favourable reception to the outward expression of any one." The figure is taken from lifting up the face of a suppliant, the radical meaning of the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> being "to take up," "to lift up." The <span class="accented">ransom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kopher</span> (the word usually applied to designate the price of redemption, mulct, or line demanded for expiation of a crime; see <a href="../../par/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31, 32</a>); here the bribe offered by the adulterer to be let off will be altogether rejected, however alluring, the word <span class="accented">p'ney</span>, "face," carrying with it the  idea of something recommendatory. For the expression, <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; and <a href="../../par/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>.

(On the verb <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to consent to," or "to be willing," see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>.) Many gifts, each increasing in value, may be offered, but he will not be willing to forego his right of revenge. <span class="accented">Though thou givest many gifts.</span> It is noticeable that the address, which has been adapted to the third person, here becomes personal, and so takes up the form originally employed in vers. 20-25. A hypothetical case has been imagined in vers. 26-35, but still with the thought underlying it that it applies to the person addressed. "Though <span class="accented">thou</span> givest many gifts," or more literally, "though thou multipliest the gift," brings the matter homo to the young man. <span class="accented">Gifts</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">shokad</span>, "the gift," is the word usually employed to designate the bribe offered to corrupt a judge (see <a href="../../par/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). Here it refers to the money offered to free from punishment. The Vulgate gives the idea that these gifts or bribes are offered by a third party on behalf of the adulterer: <span class="accented">Nec acquiescet cujusquam precibus, nec suscipiet pro redemptione dona plurima.</span> On these two last verses Lange remarks, "Just as little as the adulterer, taken in his adultery, is left unpunished by the injured husband, so little, yea, even less, wilt the spiritual adulterer remain unpunished of the Lord (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm"><title>Proverbs 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/6.htm" title="Proverbs 6">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 7 <a href="../proverbs/8.htm" title="Proverbs 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-27.</span> - 13. <span class="accented">Thirteenth admonitory discourse</span>, containing a warning against adultery, treated under a different aspect from previous exhortations, and strengthened by an example.

Part of the appointed victim was consumed by fire; the breast and right shoulder were allotted to the priests; and the rest of the animal belonged to the person who made the offering, who was to eat it with his household on the same day as a solemn ceremonial feast (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7.htm">Leviticus 7</a>). The adulteress says that certain offerings were due from her, and she had duly made them. <span class="cmt_word">This day have I payed my vows.</span> And now (the day being reckoned from one night to the next) the feast was ready, and she invites her paramour to share it. The religious nature of the feast is utterly ignored or forgotten. The shameless woman uses the opportunity simply as a convenience for her sin. If, as is probable, the "strange woman" is a foreigner, she is one who only outwardly conforms to the Mosaic Law, but in her heart cleaves to the impure worship of her heathen hems And doubtless, in lax times, these religious festivals, even in the case of worshippers who were not influenced by idolatrous proclivities, degenerated into self-indulgence and excess. The early Christian agapae were thus misused (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.); and in modern times religious anniversaries have too often become occasions of licence and debauchery, their solemn origin and pious uses being entirely thrust aside.

Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee (see on Proverbs 1:28). She tries to persuade her dupe that he is the very lover for whom she was looking, whereas she was ready to take the first that offered. Spiritual writers see in this adulteress a type of the mystery of iniquity, or false doctrine, or the harlot described in Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>, etc.; Revelation 17:1, etc.; Revelation 18:9, etc.).

The expression occurs again in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a>. It is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> "to spread," and means cushions spread out ready for use. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">funibus</span>, "cords." These versions seem to regard the word as denoting a kind of delicate sacking on which the coverlets were laid. <span class="cmt_word">Carved works, with fine linen of Egypt;</span> literally, <span class="accented">striped, or variegated, coverings, Egyptian linen.</span> The words are in  apposition, but the latter point to the material used, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">etun</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "linen yarn or thread," hence equivalent to "coverlets of Egyptian thread." This was of extreme fineness, costly, and much prized. By "carved works" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">chatuboth</span>) the Authorized Version must refer to bed poles or bed boards elaborately carved and polished; but the word is better taken of coverlets striped in different colours, which give the idea of richness and luxury.

The mention of these articles denotes the foreign commerce of the Hebrews, and their appreciation of artistic work (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>). The Prophet Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>) denounces those that "lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches."

The three perfumes are mentioned together in <a href="../../par/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; "myrrh, aloes, and cassia," in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>. Septuagint, "I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my house with cinnamon." Myrrh is nowadays imported chiefly from Bombay, but it seems to be found in Arabia and on the coasts of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. It is a gummy substance exuding from the bark of the balsamodendron when wounded, and possessing an aromatic odour not particularly agreeable to modern tastes. It was one of the ingredients of the holy oil (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-28.htm">Exodus 30:28</a>), and was used in the purification of women (<a href="../../par/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>), as well as in perfuming persons and things, and, mixed with aloes, in embalming dead bodies (<a href="../../par/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). Aloes is the inspissated juice of the leaves of the aloe, a leguminous plant growing in India, Cochin China, Abyssinia, and Socotra. The ancients used the dried root for aromatic purposes. It is mentioned by Balaam (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>). Cinnamon, which is the same word in Hebrew and Greek, is the fragrant bark of a tree growing in Ceylon and India and the east coast of <span class="accented">Africa.</span>

As an ox goeth to the slaughter. He no more realizes the serious issue of his action than an irrational beast which, without prevision of the future, walks contentedly to the slaughter house, and is stupidly placid in the face of death. Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks. There is some  difficulty in the translation of this clause. The Authorized Version, with which Delitzsch virtually agrees, is obtained by transposition of the nouns, the natural rendering of the Hebrew being "as fetters to the correction of a fool." The sense thus obtained is obvious: the youth follows the woman, as a fool or a criminal is led unresisting to confinement and degradation. Doubtless there is some error in the text, as may be seen by comparison of the versions. Septuagint (with which the Syriac agrees), "As a dog to chains, or as a hart struck to the liver with an arrow;" Vulgate, "As a frisking lamb, and not knowing that as a fool he is being dragged to bondage." The commentators are much divided. Fleischer, "As if in fetters to the punishment of the fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of himself; Ewald, "As when a steel trap (springs up) for the correction of a fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a hidden trap suddenly catches an incautious person wandering where he has no business. The direct interpretation, that the youth follows the harlot, as fetters the proper punishment of fools, is unsatisfactory, because the parallelism leads us to expect a living being instead of "fetters." We are constrained to fall back on the Authorized Version as exhibiting the best mode of reconstructing a corrupt text. The youth, with his insensate passion, is compared to the madman or idiot who is taken away, unconscious of his fate, to a shameful deprivation of liberty.

Once entangled in the toils of the temptress, the victim may pass through many stages, but he ends finally in the lowest depth - destruction of body and soul Spiritual writers see here an adumbration of the seductions of false doctrine, and the late to which it brings all who by it are led astray.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/proverbs/8.htm"><title>Proverbs 8 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/proverbs/8.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/proverbs/8.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/proverbs/8-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/7.htm" title="Proverbs 7">&#9668;</a> Proverbs 8 <a href="../proverbs/9.htm" title="Proverbs 9">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a></div><div class="verse">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-36.</span> - 14. <span class="accented">Fourteenth admonitory discourse</span> concerning Wisdom - her excellence, her origin, her gifts. She is contrasted with the strange woman of ch. 7, and the exceeding greatness of the blessings which she offers exhibits in the most marked manner the nothingness of the deceiver's gifts. One is reminded of the celebrated episode of the choice of Hercules, delineated by Xenophon, 'Memorab.,' 2:1. 21, etc. The chapter divides itself into four sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Introductory (vers. 1-3); Wisdom calls on all to listen, and gives reasons for trusting to her (vers. 4-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> She displays her  excellence (vers. 12-21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> She discourses of her origin and action (vers. 22-31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> She again inculcates the duty of hearkening to her instructions (vers. 32-36). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth not Wisdom cry?</span> (see on Proverbs 1:20, and Introduction). The interrogative form, which expects an affirmative answer, is a mode of asserting a truth universally allowed. Wisdom is personified, though we are not so plainly confronted by an individual, as in the preceding case of the harlot. But it must be remembered that, whatever may have been the author's exact meaning, however worldly a view the original enunciation may have afforded, we, reading these chapters by the light cast upon them by later revelation, see m the description of Wisdom no mere ideal of practical prudence and good sense, no mere poetic personification of an abstract quality, but an adumbration of him who is the Wisdom of God, the coeternal Son of the Father. The open, bold, and public utterances of Wisdom are in happy contrast to the secret and stealthy enticements of Vice. So Christ, the true Wisdom, says, "I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing" (<a href="../../par/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). The Septuagint changes the subject of this verse, and makes the pupil addressed: "Thou shalt proclaim (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) wisdom, that understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may obey thee;" which seems to mean that, if you wish to acquire wisdom, so that it may serve you practically, you must act as a herald or preacher, and make your desire generally known. St. Gregory has some remarks about wilful ignorance of what is right. "It is one thing," he says, "to be ignorant; another to have refused to learn. For not to know is only ignorance; to refuse to learn is pride. And they are the less able to plead ignorance in excuse, the more that knowledge is set before them, even against their will. We might, perhaps, be able to pass along the way of this present life in ignorance of this Wisdom, if she herself had not steed in the corners of the way" ('Moral.,' 25:29).

Wisdom affirms that she possesses counsel and all that can help forward righteousness; see <a href="../../par/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13, 16</a>, passages very similar to the present (comp. Wisd. 8:9, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I am understanding.</span> Wisdom does not merely possess these attributes; they are her very nature, as it is said, "God is love" St. Jerome's <span class="accented">mea est prudentia</span>, and the LXX.'s <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, lose this trait. <span class="cmt_word">I have strength.</span> Wisdom directs the energies and powers of her pupils, which without her control would be spent wrongly or uselessly (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>). Wisdom, understanding, and might are named among the seven gifts of the Spirit in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; and we may see in the passage generally an adumbration of him who is called "Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).

In the East judgment of causes was an integral part of a monarch's duties.

Nowack compares <a href="../../par/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a> and Psalms 148:11, "Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth." The Fathers have taken these verses as spoken by God, and as asserting his supremacy and the providential ordering of human government, according to St. Paul's saying, "There is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; see St. Augustine, 'De Civit. Dei,' 5:19).

"Magues amoris est amor." They who love virtue and wisdom are regarded with favour by God. whoso inspiration they have obeyed, obtaining grace for grace. So Ben Sira says, "Them that love her the Lord doth love "(Ecclus. 4:14); so Wisd. 7:28, "God loveth none but him that dwelleth with Wisdom." The Septuagint changes the verbs in this clause, though they are parts of the same word in the Hebrew: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;</span>. This reminds one of the passage in the last chapter of St. John (<a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). where a similar interchange is made. <span class="cmt_word">Those that seek me early shall find me</span> (see the contrast in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>). "Early" may mean from tender years; but more probably it is equivalent to "earnestly," "strenuously," as people deeply interested in any pursuit rise betimes to set about the necessary work (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>). The Septuagint, "They who seek (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) me shall find."

Wisdom has these things in her possession to bestow on whom she will, as God gave them to Solomon in reward of his petition for wisdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Durable riches and righteousness.</span> Things often regarded as incompatible. <span class="accented">Durable</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">athek</span>), occurs only here (but see <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and means "old," "venerable," "long accumulated;" hence firm and lasting. Righteousness is the last reward that Wisdom bestows, without which, indeed, all material blessings would be nothing worth. Wealth obtained in a right way, and rightly used, is durable and stable. This was especially true under a temporal dispensation. We Christians, however, look not for reward in uncertain riches, but in God's favour here and happiness in another world. The Septuagint, "Possession of many things, and righteousness." What is denoted by "righteousness" is further explained in the following verses, 19-21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a></div><div class="verse">My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My fruit is better than</span> <span class="cmt_word">gold.</span> We have had Wisdom called "a tree of life" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), and the gain from possessing her compared to gold and silver (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">paz</span>); Septuagint and Vulgate, "precious stone."

So the psalmist prays, "Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end;" "Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>). And the promise is given to the faithful in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>, "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left." Virtue, as Aristotle has taught us, is the mean between two extremes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a></div><div class="verse">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may cause those that</span> <span class="cmt_word">love me to inherit substance;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">yesh</span>), <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "real, valuable possessions." Those who love Wisdom will walk in her path, follow her leading, and therefore, doing God's will, will be blessed with success. Such will lay up treasure in heaven, will provide bags which wax not old, will be preparing for "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). The LXX. here inserts a paragraph as a kind of introduction to the important section which follows: "If I declare unto you the things which daily befall, I will remember to recount the things of eternity;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thus far I have spoken of the advantages derived from Wisdom in daily circumstances; now I proceed to narrate her origin and her doings from all eternity. But the addition appears awkward, and is probably not now in its original position. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-31.</span> - Wisdom speaks of her origin, her active operations, the part which she bore in the creation of the universe, her relation to God (see on Proverbs 1:20 and Proverbs 3:19, and Introduction). It is impossible to decide what was the exact view of the writer with regard to the wisdom of which he speaks so eloquently; but there can be no doubt that he was guided in his diction so as to give expression to the idea of him whom St. John calls the Word of God. The language used is not applicable to an impersonal quality, an abstract faculty of God. It describes the nature and office of a Person; and who that Person is we learn from the later Scriptures, which speak of Christ as the "Wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>) and "the Power of God and the Wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). If we confine our inquiry to the question - What was in the mind of the author when he indited this wonderful section concerning Wisdom? we shall fail to apprehend its true significance, and shall be disowning the influence of the Holy Spirit, which inspires all Scripture, which prompted the holy men who spake to utter words of which they knew not the full spiritual significance, and which could only be understood by subsequent revelation. There is, then, nothing forced or incongruous in seeing in this episode a portraiture of the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, the essential Wisdom of God personified, the Logos of later books, and of the gospel. This interpretation obtained universally in the Church in the earliest times, and has commended itself to the most learned and reverent of modern commentators. That much which was contained in their own utterances was unknown to the prophets of old, that they did not fully perceive the mysteries which they darkly enunciated, we learn from St. Peter,  who tells us that they who prophesied of the grace of Christ sought and searched diligently what the Spirit of God that was in them did point unto, and were shown that not unto themselves, but unto us, they ministered those things, secrets which angels themselves desire to look into (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a>, etc.). Wisdom as a human endowment, animating all intellectual and even physical powers; Wisdom as communicating to man moral excellence and piety; Wisdom as not only an attribute of God, but itself as the eternal thought of God; - under these aspects it is regarded in our book; but under and through all it is more or less personified. <span class="accented">Khochmah</span> is contrasted in the next chapter, not with an abstraction, but with an actual woman of impure life - a real, not an imaginary, antagonist. The personality of the latter intimates that of the former (see Liddon, 'Bampt. Lects.,' 2.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord possessed me.</span> Great controversy has arisen about the word rendered "possessed." The verb used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kanah</span>), which means properly "to erect, set upright," also "to found, form" (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>), then "to acquire" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5, 7</a>, etc.) or "to possess" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>). The Vulgate, Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus, Venetian, give "possessed;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "made," and so Syriac. The Arians took the word in the sense of "created" (which, though supported by the LXX., it seems never to have had), and deduced therefrom the Son's inferiority to the Father - that he was made, not begotten from all eternity. Ben Sira more than once employs the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in speaking of Wisdom's origin; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ecclus. 1:4, 9 Ecclus. 24:8. Opposing the heresy of the Arians, the Fathers generally adopted the rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">possedit</span>, "possessed;" and even those who received the translation <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, explained it not of creating, but of appointing, thus: The Father set Wisdom over all created things, or made Wisdom to be the efficient cause of his creatures (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). May we not say that the writer was guided to use a word which would express relation in a twofold sense? Wisdom is regarded either as the mind of God expressed in operation, or the Second Person of the Holy Trinity; and the verb thus signifies that God possesses in himself this essential Wisdom, and intimates likewise that Wisdom by eternal generation is a Divine Personality. St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), before saying that the Word was God, affirms that "the Word was with God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)." So we may assert that Solomon has arrived at the truth that Wisdom was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, if he has left it for later revelation to declare that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. Whichever sense we assign to the verb on which the difficulty is supposed to hang, whether we take it as "possessed," "formed," or "acquired," we may safely assume that the idea conveyed to Christian minds is this - that Wisdom, existing eternally in the Godhead, was said to be "formed" or "brought forth" when it operated in creation, and when it assumed human nature. <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of his way.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in initio viarum suarum.</span> But the preposition "in" does not occur in the original; and the words may be bettor translated, "as the beginning of his way" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the earliest revelation of his working. Wisdom, eternal and uncreated, first puts forth its energy in creation, then becomes incarnate, and is now called, "the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>); and, "When he bringeth in the Firstborn into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>). In the present clause, the ways of God are his works, as in <a href="../../par/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a> and Job 40:19, where behemoth is called "chief among the ways of God" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>, where "ways" stands as a parallel to "works"). <span class="cmt_word">Before his works of old.</span> These words are better regarded (with Delitzsch) as a second parallel object, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">kedem</span>), translated "before," being not a preposition, but denoting previous existence. Hence we translate, "The foremost of his works of old;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the earliest revelation of his energy. There is a curious passage in the 'Book of Enoch,' ch. 42, which speaks of the personality and pre-existence of Wisdom, of her desire to dwell among men, frustrated by man's wickedness: "Wisdom found no place where she could dwell; therefore was her dwelling in heaven. Wisdom came forth in order to dwell among the sons of men, and found no habitation; then she returned to her place, and took her seat among the angels." We may add Wisd. 8:3, "In that she dwelleth with God (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), she magnifieth her nobility."

It is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>(<span class="accented">nasak</span>), in niph.; and it is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, "I have set my King upon my holy hill." Both here and there it has been translated "anointed," which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there  seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly "to pour forth" (as of molten metal), then "to put down," "to appoint or establish." The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, "he established (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) me;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ordinata sum</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a></div><div class="verse">When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The preexistence of Wisdom is still more expressly set forth. <span class="cmt_word">When there were no depths</span> (vers. 27, 28). The waste of waters which covered the face of the earth is meant - that great deep on which primeval darkness brooded (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). Before even this, man's earliest conception of the beginning of the world, uncreated Wisdom was. Septuagint, "before he made the abysses" (see on Proverbs 3:20). <span class="cmt_word">I was brought forth;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">et ego jam concepta eram</span>; Septuagint, at the end of ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, "he begetteth me." The verb here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">chul</span>), which is used of the travailing of women, and is rightly translated, "brought forth by generation." It indicates in this place the energizing of Wisdom, her conception in the Divine mind, and her putting tbrth in operation. <span class="cmt_word">When there were no fountains abounding with water;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> springs in the interior of the earth (<a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/job/22.htm">Job 22, 26, 38</a>.). Septuagint,"Before the springs of the waters came forward (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)."

It is questioned <span class="accented">where</span> the mountains were supposed to be fixed, and some have thought that they are represented as fixed in the depths of the earth. But, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, they are regarded as rising from the waters, their foundations are laid in the great deep. So the psalmist, speaking of the waters, says, "They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them" (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>). What is here affirmed of Wisdom is said of Jehovah in <a href="../../par/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth, nor the fields</span>. The distinction intended is land as cultivated and occupied by buildings, etc., and waste uncultivated land outside towns. Septuagint, "The Lord made countries and uninhabited places (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">chutsoth</span>; things without, abroad, hence open country. The Vulgate rendering, and that of Aquila and Symmaehus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, are plainly erroneous, as waters have already been mentioned (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">The highest part of the dust of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the head of the dusts of the world.</span> Some have interpreted this expression of "man," the chief of those creatures which are made of the dust of the ground (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). But the idea comes in awkwardly here; it is not natural to introduce man amid the inanimate works of nature, or to use such an enigmatical designation for him. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">cardines orbis terrarum</span>, "the world's hinges;" Septuagint, "the inhabited summits of the earth beneath the heavens; according to St. Hilary ('De Trinit.,' 12), "cacumina quae habitantur sub coelo." Others take the term to signify the capes or promontories ot the world, the peaks and elevations; others, the clods of dry, amble land, in contrast to the untilled waste of waters; others, the chief elements, the matter of which the earth is composed. This last interpretation would lead us back to a period which has already been passed. Amid the many possible explanations, it is perhaps best (with Delitzsch, Nowack, etc.) to take <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "head" as equivalent to "sum," "mass," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>. "How great is the sum (<span class="accented">rosh</span>) of them!" Then the expression comprehensively means all the mass of earth's dust.

Thus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> we have, "It is he that sitteth above the circle (<span class="accented">chug</span>) of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vault of heaven that encircles the earth. Septuagint, "When he  marked out (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>) his throne upon the winds."

Thus in Wisd. 7:22 Wisdom is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the worker of all things." The Authorized Version takes the word in a passive state, as equivalent to <span class="accented">alumnus</span>, "foster child." and this interpretation is etymologically admissible, and may possibly, as Schultens suggests, be glanced at in St. John's expression (John 1:18), "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father." But as the point here is the creative energy of Wisdom, it is best to take the term as denoting "artificer." It will then accord with the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by the Fathers to the Word of God, by whom all things were made (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, Textus Receptus, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I was daily his delight;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was delights day by day</span>, which may mean either as in Authorized Version, or "I had delight continually," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it may signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either that God took pleasure in the wisdom which displayed his workmanship, saw that it was very good (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>, etc.), looked with delight on the beloved Son in whom he was well pleased (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may mean that Wisdom herself rejoiced in her power and her work, rejoiced in giving effect to the Creator's idea, and so "founding the earth" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">delectabar per singulos dies.</span> The Septuagint adopts the former of these views, "I was that wherein he took delight." But the second interpretation seems most suitable, as the paragraph is stating rather what Wisdom is in herself than what she was in the eyes of Jehovah. What follows is a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing always before him;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">ludens coram eo omni tempore</span>, as though the work of creation was a sport and pastime of a happy holiday. The expression is meant to denote the ease with which the operations were performed, and the pleasure which their execution yielded. David uses the same word, speaking of his dancing before the ark, when he says. "Therefore will I play before the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>).

The chapter sums up in brief the warnings of the preceding part. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Wisdom was represented as having a house at whose portals persons waited eagerly for admission (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>); the idea is further carried on. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom hath builded her house.</span> (For the plural form of <span class="accented">khochmoth</span>, "wisdom," a plural of excellency, see on Proverbs 1:20.) As the "strange woman" in ch. 7. possessed a house to which she seduced her victim, so Wisdom is represented as having a house which she has made and adorned, and to which she invites her pupils. Spiritual writers see here two references - one to Christ's incarnation, when he built for himself a human body (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and another to his work in forming the Church, which is his mystical body (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). And the sublime language used in this section is not satisfied with the bare notion that we have here only an allegorical representation of Wisdom calling followers to her. Rather we are constrained to see a Divine intimation of the office and work of Christ, not only the Creator of the world, as in ch. 8, but its Regenerator. <span class="cmt_word">She hath hewn out her seven pillars</span>. Architecturally, according to Hitzig and others, the pillars  of the inner court are meant, which supported the gallery of the first story. Four of these were m the corners, three in the middle of three sides, while the entrance to the court was through the fourth side of the square. The number seven generally denotes perfection; it is the covenant number, expressive of harmony and unity generally, the signature of holiness and blessing, completeness and rest. So in the Apocalypse the whole Church is represented by the number of seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, etc.; see on Proverbs 26:16). Wisdom's house is said to be thus founded because of its perfection and adaptability to all states of men. But doubtless there is a reference to the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit, which rested upon the Christ (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.), and which are the support and strength of the Church, being symbolized by the seven-branched candlestick in the temple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She hath killed her beasts.</span> So in the parable of the marriage of the king's son (<a href="../../par/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, which is parallel to the present), the king sends his servants to notify the guests that the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Wisdom has stores of nourishment for understanding and affection; and Christ has offered himself as a Victim in our behalf, and now makes bounteous offers of grace, and especially has ordained the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the strengthening and refreshing of the soul. <span class="cmt_word">She hath mingled her wine;</span> Septuagint, "She hath mixed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) her wine in a bowl." The wine which, untempered, was too luscious or too fiery to drink, was made palatable by a certain admixture of water, it was always so mixed at the Passover; and the ancient Christian Liturgies direct the mixture in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, doubtless from traditional use. Some, however, think that allusion is here made to the custom of adding drugs to wine in order to increase its potency. Among the Greeks, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> meant "wine without water," and in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "undiluted wine mixed." And probably in the text the notion is that the fluid for the guests' delectation is properly prepared, that there may be no trouble when they arrive (see on Proverbs 23:30). <span class="cmt_word">She hath also furnished her table,</span> by arranging the dishes, etc., thereon (<a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "Thou preparest a table before me," where the same verb, <span class="accented">arak</span>, is used; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>). Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory says, "The Lord 'killed the sacrifices' by offering himself on our behalf. He 'mingled the wine,' blending together the cup of his precepts from the historical narration and the spiritual signification. And he 'set forth his table,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Holy Writ, which with the bread of the Word refreshes us when we are wearied and come to him away from the burdens of the world, and by its effect of refreshing strengthens us against our adversaries" ('Moral,' 17:43, Oxford transl.).

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "her servants," but the Authorized Version is correct, and feminine attendants are in strict harmony with the rest of the apologue. By them are represented the apostles and preachers and ministers, who go forth to win souls for Christ. St. Gregory sees in their being called "maidens" an intimation that they are in themselves weak and abject, and are only useful and honoured as being the mouthpiece of their Lord ('Moral.,' 33:33). <span class="cmt_word">She crieth upon the highest places of the city,</span> where her voice could best be heard, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. She is not satisfied with delegating her message to others; she delivers it herself. Septuagint, "calling with a loud proclamation to the cup (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Misit ancillas suas ut vocarent ad arcem et ad moenia civitatis</span>, "She has sent her handmaids to invite to the citadel, and to the wails of the town." On which rendering St. Gregory comments, "In that while they tell of the interior life, they lift us up to the high walls of the city above, which same walls, surely, except any be humble, they do not ascend" ('Moral.,' 17:43). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-12.</span> - Here follows the invitation of Wisdom, urging the attendance of guests at the sumptuous banquet which she has prepared (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose is simple, lot him turn in hither.</span> This is a direct address to the imprudent and inexperienced (see on Proverbs 7:7), calling them to turn aside from the way on which they are going, and to come to her. Vulgate, <span class="accented">si quis est parvulus veniat ad me</span>, which reminds one of Christ's tender words, "It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish" (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him what follows</span> (so ver. 16). Wisdom's own speech is interrupted, and the writer himself introduces this little clause. She calls on the simple and the unwise, both as necessarily needing her teaching, and not yet inveterate in evil, nor wilfully opposed to better guidance. "The world by wisdom knew not God" and he "hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised,  hath God chosen" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21, 26</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>).

Bread and wine represent all needful nourishment, as flesh and wine in ver. 2. So Christ says (<a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>), "I am the living Bread which came down from heaven...  and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." Compare the invitation in <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, "He, every one that thirsteth!" etc. The Fathers see here a prophecy of the gospel feast, wherein Christ gave and gives bread and wine as symbols of his presence (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>, etc.).

It is not a mere prosperous life on earth that is here promised, but something far higher and better (<a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, "If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever"). The LXX. saw something of this when they paraphrased the clause, "Leave ye folly, that ye may reign forever." <span class="cmt_word">Go in the way of understanding.</span> Leaving folly, stay not, but make real progress in the direction of wisdom. Septuagint, "Seek ye prudence, and direct understanding by knowledge." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - These verses form a parenthesis, showing why Wisdom addresses only the simple and foolish. She giveth not that which is holy unto dogs, nor casteth pearls before swine (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame.</span> He who tries to correct a scorner (see on Proverbs 1:22 and Proverbs 3:34), one who derides religion, loses his pains and meets with ribald mockery and insult. It is not the fault of messengers or message that this should be, but the hardness of heart and the pride of the hearer make him despise the teaching and hate the teacher (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he that reproveth a sinner, it is his blot.</span> Such a proceeding results in disgrace to himself. This is not said to discourage the virtuous from reproving transgressors, but states the effect which experience proves to occur in such cases. Prudence, caution, and tact are needed in dealing with these characters. Evil men regard the reprover as a personal enemy, and treat him with contumely, and hence arise unseemly bickerings and disputes, injurious words and deeds. To have wasted teaching on such unreceptive and antagonistic natures is a shameful expenditure of power. St. Gregory thus explains this matter: "It generally happens that when they cannot defend the evils that are reproved in them, they are rendered worse from a feeling of shame, and carry themselves so high in their defence of themselves, that they take out bad points to urge against the life of the reprover, and so they do not account themselves guilty, if they fasten guilty deeds upon the heads of others also. And when they are unable to find true ones, they feign them, that they may also themselves have things they may seem to rebuke with no inferior degree of justice" ('Moral.,' 10:3, Oxford transl.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee</span> (see the last note, and comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a>, and note there). There are times when reproof only hardens and exasperates. "It is not proper," says St. Gregory, "for the good man to fear lest the scorner should utter abuse at him when he is chidden, but lest, being drawn into hatred, he should be made worse" ('Moral.,' 8:67). "Bad men sometimes we spare, and not ourselves, if from the love of those we cease from the rebuking of them. Whence it is needful that we sometimes endure keeping to ourselves what they are, in order that they may learn in us by our good living what they are not" (ibid., 20:47, Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</span> So <a href="../../par/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>, "Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise <i>man</i>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <i>man</i>, and he will increase in learning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser.</span> The Hebrew is merely "give to the wise," with no object mentioned; but the context suggests "instruction," even though, as in ver. 8, it takes the form of rebuke. Vulgate and Septuagint, "Give an opportunity to a wise man, and he will be wiser" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a>). To make the best use of all occasions of learning duty, whether they present themselves in a winning or a forbidden shape, is the part of one who is wise unto salvation (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</span> Wisdom being a moral and not merely an intellectual, quality. there is a natural interchange of "wise" and "just," referring to the same individual,  in the two clauses. Vulgate, <span class="accented">festinabit accipere</span>; Septuagint, "Instruct a wise man, and he shall have more given him." The wise are thus rewarded with larger measures of wisdom, because they are simple, humble, and willing to learn, having that childlike spirit which Christ commends (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Wisdom returns to the first apothegm and principle of the whole book (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Without the fear of God no teaching is of any avail. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge of the holy is understanding.</span> The word translated "the holy" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, a plural of excellence (see on Proverbs 30:3) like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and equivalent to "the Most Holy One," Jehovah, to which it answers in the first hemistich. God is called "Holy, holy, holy" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>), in his threefold nature, and as majestic beyond expression. The only knowledge worth having, and which is of avail for the practical purposes of life, is the knowledge of God (see on Proverbs 2:5). Septuagint, "The counsel of the holy (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is understanding," with the explanatory clause; "for to know the Law is the character of good thought." This occurs again at <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>, though in the Hebrew in neither place. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The parenthetical explanation being concluded, in which Wisdom has intimated why it is useless to appeal to the scorner and the wilful sinner, she now resumes the direct address interrupted at ver. 7, presenting a forcible reason for the advice given in ver. 6, though there is still some connection with ver. 10, as it is from the wisdom that comes from the fear of the Lord that the blessings now mentioned spring. <span class="cmt_word">For by me thy days shall be multiplied</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10</a>, where long life is promised as a reward for the possession and practice of wisdom). The same result is attributed to the fear of God (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>, etc.). In ver. 6 the address is in the plural; here it is singular. A similar interchange is found in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-7.htm">Proverbs 5:7, 8</a> (where see note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12</a></div><div class="verse">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise</span> <span class="cmt_word">for thyself.</span> A transition verse.

In support of our text we may quote <a href="../../par/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>, "Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself." <span class="cmt_word">But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt hear it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> atone for it, bear the sin, as it is expressed in <a href="../../par/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a>, "Forevery man shall bear his own burden" (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>). Thus Wisdom ends her exhortation. Septuagint, "If thou turn out evil, thou alone shalt bear (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) evils." And then is added the following paragraph, which may possibly be derived from a Hebrew original, but seems more like a congeries made up from other passages, and foisted by some means into the Greek text: "He that stayeth himself on lies shepherdeth winds, and himself pursueth flying birds; for he hath left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath gone astray with the wheels of his own husbandry; and he goeth through a waterless desert, and over a land set in thirsty places, and with his hands he gathereth unfruitfulness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous: <i>she is</i> simple, and knoweth nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-18.</span> - This section contains the invitation of Folly, the rival of Wisdom, represented under the guise of an adulteress (<a href="../../par/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>, etc.; Proverbs 6:24, etc.; Proverbs 7.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I foolish woman;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the woman of folly</span>, the genitive being that of apposition, so that this may well be rendered, in order to make the contrast with Wisdom more marked, "the woman Folly." She is regarded as a real person; and between her and Virtue man has to make his choice. Is <span class="cmt_word">clamorous;</span> turbulent and animated by passion (as <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>), quite different from her calm, dignified rival. She is <span class="cmt_word">simple</span>; Hebrew, "simplicity," in a bad sense; she has no preservative against evil, no moral fibre to resist temptation. <span class="cmt_word">And knoweth nothing</span> which she ought to know. Ignorance is the natural accompaniment of Folly: in this case it is wilful and persistent; she goes on her way reckless of consequences. Septuagint, "A woman foolish and bold, who knows not shame, comes to want a morsel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She sitteth at the door of her house</span>. She, like Wisdom, has a house of her own, and imitates her in inviting guests to enter. She does not send forth her maidens; she does not stand in the streets and proclaim her mission. Vice has an easier task; all she has to do is to sit and beckon and use a few seductive words. Her house is not supported by seven pillars, built on the grace of God and upheld by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. like that of Wisdom (ver. 1); it is an ordinary habitation of no stately proportions. but its meanness impedes not the uses to which she puts it, her own charms causing her victims to disregard her environments. <span class="cmt_word">On a seat in the high pluses of the city.</span> Her house is in the highest and most conspicuous part of the city, and she sits before her door in reckless immodesty, plying her shameful trade (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>). The mimicry of her rival again   appears, for Wisdom "crieth upon the highest places of the city" (ver. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To call passengers who go right on their ways.</span> With shameless effrontery she cries to all that pass by, she addresses her solicitations to persons who are going straight on their way, thinking nothing of her, having no idea of deviating from their pursued object. As they walk in the path of right and duty, she tries to turn them aside. Septuagint, "Calling to herself (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) those that pass by and are keeping straight in their ways." The Fathers find here a picture of the seductions of heretical teaching, which puts on the mask of orthodoxy and deceives the unwary. Wordsworth notes that, in the Apocalypse, the false teacher bears some emblems of the Lamb (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>). All false doctrine retains some element of truth, and it is because of this admixture that it procures adherents and thrives for a time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - These verses contain the invitation which Vice, in imitation of Virtue, and assuming her voice and manner, offers to the wayfarers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither.</span> She uses the very same words which Wisdom utters (ver. 4). The latter had addressed the simple because they were inexperienced and undecided, and might be guided aright; the former now speaks to them because they have not vet made their final choice, can still be swayed by lower considerations, and may be led astray. Such persons find it hard to distinguish between the good and the evil, the false and the true, especially when their sensual appetite is aroused and sides with the temptress. No marvel is it that such are easily deceived; for we are told that, under certain circumstances, Satan transforms himself into an angel of light (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That wanteth understanding.</span> This is the other class addressed by Wisdom, and which Folly now solicits, urging them to follow her on the path of pleasure, promising sensual enjoyment and security. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <i>eaten</i> in secret is pleasant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This is what she says: <span class="cmt_word">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</span> The metaphor of "stolen waters" refers primarily to adulterous intercourse, as to "drink waters out of one's own cistern" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15</a>, where see note) signifies the chaste connection of lawful wedlock. Wisdom offered flesh and wine to her guests; Folly offers bread and water. Wisdom invites openly to a well furnished table; Folly calls to a secret meal of barest victuals. What the former offers is rich and satisfying and comforting; what Vice gives is poor and mean and insipid. Yet this latter has the charm of being forbidden; it is attractive because it is unlawful. This is a trait of corrupt human nature, which is recognized universally. Thus Ovid, 'Amor.,' 3:4, 17 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata;<br />Sic interdictis imminet aeger aquis.'</span> Things easily attained, the possession of which is gotten without effort or danger or breach of restraint, soon pall and cease to charm. To some minds the astuteness and secrecy required for success have an irresistible attraction. Thus St. Augustine relates ('Conf.,' 2:4) how he and some companions committed a theft, not from want and poverty, nor even from the wish to enjoy what was stolen, but simply for the pleasure of thieving and the sin. They robbed a pear tree by night, carried off great loads, which they flung to the pigs, and their only satisfaction was that they were doing what they ought not ("dum tamen fieret a nobis, quod eo liberet quo non liceret"). Septuagint, "Taste ye to your pleasure secret bread, and sweet water of theft." Where water is a precious commodity, as in many pets of Palestine, doubtless thefts were often committed, and persons made free with their neighbor's tank when they could do so undetected, thus sparing their own resources and felicitating themselves on their cleverness. On the metaphorical use of "waters" in Holy Scripture, St. Gregory says, "Waters are sometimes wont to denote the Holy Spirit, sometimes sacred knowledge, sometimes calamity, sometimes drifting peoples, sometimes the minds of those following the faith." He refers to these texts respectively: <a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>, etc.; Ecclus. 15:3; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> ("the waters are peoples"); <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a>; and he adds, "By water likewise bad knowledge is wont to be designated, as when the woman in Solomon, who bears the type of heresy, charms with crafty persuasion, saying, 'Stolen waters are sweet'" ('Moral.,' 19:9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">But he knoweth not that the dead <i>are</i> there; <i>and that</i> her guests <i>are</i> in the depths of hell.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The deluded youth is supposed to be persuaded by the seductions of Folly and to enter her house. The writer, then, in a few weighty words, shows the terrible result of this evil compliance. <span class="cmt_word">But he knoweth not that the dead are there</span> (see on Proverbs 2:18 and Proverbs 7:27). There are none "there," in her house, who can be said to be living, they are <span class="accented">rephaim</span>, shadowy ghosts of living men, or else demons of the nether world. The Septuagint and Vulgate, with a reference to <a href="../../par/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, translate <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="accented">gigantes. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Her guests are in the depths of hell</span> (<span class="accented">sheol</span>); Septuagint, "He knows not that giants perish at her side, and he meets with a trap of hell." The terrible warning may profitably be repeated more than once,  It is like Christ's awful saying, three times enunciated, "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (<a href="../../par/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44, 46, 48</a>). The LXX. has another paragraph at the end of this verse, which has no counterpart in the Hebrew: "But start away, delay not in the place, nor put thy name ['eye,' <span class="accented">al</span>.] by her; for thus shalt thou pass over (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) strange water; but abstain thou from strange water, and of a strange spring drink not, that thou mayest live long, and years of life may be added to thee." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../proverbs/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Proverbs 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Proverbs 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
