So Moses, in his song (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>), calls on heaven and earth to listen to his words (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). These expressions are not mere rhetorical figures; they have a special application. Whatever happens to Israel has a bearing on the development of the kingdom of God; the judgments on the chosen people are not only a warning to the heathen, but bring on the great consummation. <span class="cmt_word">All that therein is;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the fulness thereof</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">plentitudo ejus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "all ye that are therein" (<a href="../../par/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let the Lord God</span> (<span class="accented">the Lord Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>be witness against you</span>.

God is hidden except when he displays his power in judgment and mercy (see note on Zechariah 14:3). <span class="cmt_word">Will come down.</span> An anthropomorphic expression, as <a href="../../par/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The high places.</span> As though descending from heaven, God first came upon the tops of the mountains (see note on Amos 4:13; comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>).

The idea that underlies this description is that the inanimate creation shares in the effects of the judgment on man, and is used as an instrument in his punishment.

He names the capitals of the two kingdoms as the source and centre of the idolatry and wickedness which pervaded the whole country. Samaria was built by Omri, a king who "wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him;" and in it his son Ahab erected a temple to Baal (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>), and it became the chief seat of idolatry in the land. <span class="cmt_word">What are the high places?</span> The prophet seems to say that Jerusalem is no longer the Lord's sanctuary, but a collection of unauthorized or idolatrous shrines. These were buildings or altars erected in conspicuous spots, contrary to the enactments of the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11-14</a>), and used more or less for idolatrous worship. With a strange perversity, the Jews mixed the pure service of Jehovah with the rites of heathen deities. Even the best kings of Judah were unable wholly to suppress these local sanctuaries (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, etc.). They were found even in Jerusalem itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>), especially in the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>). The parallelism of this clause with the preceding being thought defective ("high places" being not parallel with "apostasy"), the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "the sin," followed by the Syriac and the Targum. One Hebrew manuscript confirms the reading; but it is probably unauthorized, and has been ignorantly introduced The prophet defines the sins of Samaria and Jerusalem. The sin of the former is apostasy; that of the latter, unauthorized worship. Instead of "what" in both places the Hebrew gives "who," implying that there is a personal cause, the two capitals being personified. Hezekiah's partial reformation had not taken place when this was uttered.

Such shall be the utter ruin of the city, that on its site vines shall be planted. The prophet here uses a description of complete destruction which is a regular formula in Assyrian inscriptions, where we read of cities being made into "a rubbish heap and a field." The expression occurs, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in a monument of Tiglath-Pileser (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 449). <span class="cmt_word">I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley</span>. Samaria stood on a hilly platform (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), with a sheer descent on every side, and when it was overthrown its stones were hurled into the valley surrounding it, as may be seen to this day. "When we looked down," says Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 136), "at the gaunt columns rising out of the little terraced fields, and the vines clambering up the sides of the hill once covered by the palaces of proud Samaria, who could help recalling the prophecy of Micah? Not more literally have the denunciations on Tyre or on Babylon been accomplished. What though Sebaste rose, under Herod, to a pitch of greater splendour than even old Samaria, the effort was in vain, and the curse has been fully accomplished.

Idolatry is viewed as spiritual fornication, and the offerings made to the idol temples are reckoned to be harlot gifts.

The judgment on Samaria was executed by the Assyrians. Three times in his short reign of less than six years did Shalmaneser IV. invade Israel. Shortly after his accession, having reason to suspect the fidelity of Hoshea, he "came up against him" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>), and so overawed him by the exhibition of his superior power that the King of Israel submitted without a struggle, "became his servants and gave him presents," or rendered him tribute. But Hoshea's allegiance was not yet secured. Encouraged by the enterprise and success of the Ethiopian monarch So, or Shebek, who had defeated and slain the Egyptian king, and established himself firmly on the throne of Upper Egypt, Hoshea, in reliance on Egyptian aid, again threw off the yoke of Assyria, and refused the customary tribute. His punishment was speedy and sharp. Shalmaneser had no difficulty in making himself master of his person, "shut him up and bound him in prison." On a fresh act of rebellion, of what nature we are not informed, Shalmaneser made his third attack. This time he was everywhere resisted, and ended by laying siege to Samaria itself. Before this city his forces were detained for more than two years; nor was it till  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, when apparently his own reign had come to an end, that Samaria was taken, his successor Sargon claiming the conquest as appertaining to his first year (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2. ch. 9.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - 3. <span class="accented">Micah mourns because the punishment extends to Judah also.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will wail.</span> The prophet marks the destruction of Samaria with these outward signs of mourning, in order that he might affect the minds of his own countrymen, and show how he grieved over their sins which should bring like punishment. The word rendered "wail" means "to beat" the breast.

The two epithets contain one notion; the prophet assumes the character, not merely of a mourner, who put off his usual garments, but that of a captive who was stripped to the skin and carried away naked and despoiled (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dragons</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: Hebrew, <span class="accented">tannim</span>, "jackals" (<a href="../../par/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>), whose mournful howling is well known to all travellers in the East. <span class="cmt_word">Owls</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "daughters of sirens;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">struthionum.</span> The bird is called in Hebrew bath <span class="accented">yaanah</span>, which some explain "daughter of the desert," or else refer to roots meaning either "to cry out" or "to be freed."

Gath is mentioned as the seat of the Philistines, the constant and powerful enemy  of Judah. (For its situation, see note on Amos 6:2.) The paronomasias in this passage, which seem to modern ears artificial and puerile, are paralleled in many writings both Hebrew and classic, and were natural to a people who looked for mystical meaning in words and names. Thus Gath is taken to signify "Tell town," and the clause is, "In Tell town tell it not." <span class="cmt_word">Weep ye not at all;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">lacrymis ne ploretis</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "weep in silence," or "hide your tears," that the enemy may not know your grief. As in cash of the other clauses a town is mentioned, some editors would here read, "In Acco ('Weep town') weep not!" - Acco being the later Ptolemais, the modern St. Jean d'Acre, and taken here to represent another foreign city which would rejoice at Judah's misfortunes (see, <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>). The Septuagint alone of all the versions seems to countenance this reading, by translating, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye Enakim, do not rebuild," which has been resolved into <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;</span>, supposed to be an error for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;</span> The objections against this reading may be seen in Keil and Pusey. There is a play on the words in both these clauses (as in the following five verses), which is not seen in the English Version, <span class="accented">begath al taggidu</span>, and <span class="accented">bako al tibeku.</span> Knabenbauer imitates the paronomasia in Latin, "Cannis ne canite; Anconae ne angamini;" Ewald and Schegg in German, "In Molln meldet nicht; in Weinsberg. weinet nicht;" Reuss in French, "N'allez pas le dire a Dijon! N'allez pas pleurer a Ploermel!" In these puns, as we should call them, the prophet is far, indeed, from jesting. "He sees," says Dr. Cheyne, "like Isaiah, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>, a preordained correspondence between names and fortunes;" and he wishes to impress this on his countrymen, that the judgment may not come upon them unwarned. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of Aphrah</span>; better, at <span class="accented">Beth-le-Aphrah, i.e.</span> "House of dust;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in domo pulveris.</span> The site of Aphrah is unknown. Some identify it with Ophrah in Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), four miles northeast of Bethel; others, with Ophrah in Philistia (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-14.htm">1 Chronicles 4:14</a>). Host of the towns named below lie in the Shephelah. Keil notes that the word is pointed with <span class="accented">pathach</span> here for the sake of the paronomasia. <span class="cmt_word">Roll thyself in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">sprinkle dust upon thyself</span>. This was a common sign of mourning (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). The Hebrew text (in contradistinction to the margin, Keri) gives, "I roll myself," or "I have besprinkled myself," the prophet identifying himself with the people. But as in all the subsequent passages, not what the prophet does, but what the inhabitants do, is the point impressed, the reading of the Keri is hem to be preferred. Vulgate, <span class="accented">pulvere vos conspergite.</span> The Septuagint has an inexplicable rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "against laughter sprinkle earth," which Brenton translates, "sprinkle dust in the place of your laughter." With this section (vers. 10-15) should be compared <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, which describes the alarm occasioned by Sennacherib's invasion of Judah from the northeast, as Micah represents his progress to the southwest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye away.</span> Leave your house. <span class="cmt_word">Thou inhabitant of Saphir.</span> The Hebrew is "inhabitress," the population being personified as a virgin (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). "Saphir" means "Fair city."

St. Jerome, in despair of explaining these Greek renderings, says here, "Multum Hebraicum a LXX. interpretatione discordat, et tantis tam mea quam illorum translatio difficultatibus involuta est, ut si quando indiguimus Spiritus Dei (semper autem in exponendis Scripturis sanctis illius indigemus adventu), nunc vel maxime eum adesse cupiamus." <span class="cmt_word">Zaanan</span> is supposed to be the same as Zenan, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>. The meaning of the name is doubtful. It is taken to signify "abounding in flocks" or "going out." <span class="cmt_word">Came not forth;</span> or, <span class="accented">is not come forth.</span> The paronomasia seems to lie rather in sound than sense, and is variously explained, "The inhabitants of Flock town went not forth with their flocks." "The dwellers of Forthcoming came not forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to flee, or to fight, or to aid their brethren; or did not escape destruction. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Non est egressa quae habitat in exitu</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, "She who dwelt at Sennaar came not forth." <span class="cmt_word">In the mourning,</span> etc. These words are best joined with the following clause, thus: <span class="accented">The mourning of Beth-ezel taketh from you its standing</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refuge or shelter. Beth-ezel is explained, "House at one's side." "Neighbour town;" so the prophet would say, "Neighbour town is no neighbour to you," affords you no help. But various other explanations are given. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Lamentation makes its sure abode at Beth-ezel from your calamity." This may, perhaps, be supported by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "She shall receive of you the stroke of anguish." Dr. Cheyne connects the whole  verse with one idea, "Zaanan would willingly take to flight, but the sound of the mourning at Beth-ezel (which might mean, "the house, or place, at one's side') fills them with despair." Taking Beth-ezel to mean "House of root," others would interpret, on account of the public sorrow, "The 'house of root' affords no firm home for you." Others, again," The lamentation of 'The near House' will not stop near it, but pass on to other places." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-ezel</span> is probably the <span class="accented">Azal</span> of <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, the <span class="accented">beth</span> being dropped, as is often the case.

She was the beginning, etc. How Lachish came to adopt the idolatry of Israel, and how she infected Judah, we know not. A connection between Jerusalem and Lachish is found in the case of Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>), but nothing bearing on religion is mentioned. The whole clause is translated by Calmer, Keil, etc., thus: "It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion that the iniquities of Israel were found in thee" (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). The particular transgressions meant may be the idolatry of Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>) and Ahaziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3, 4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>.

The prophet here addresses Judah, and continues to do so to the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou give presents to Moreshsth-Gath.</span> The "presents" intended are parting gifts, farewell presents. The word is used (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>) for the dowry given to a daughter when she is married. The meaning, therefore, is that Judah must relinquish all claim to Moresheth. The paronomasia is explained in two ways. As <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> may mean "possession," the prophet may be understood to say, "Thou shalt give up possession of Gath's possession." Or the play of words may depend upon the similarity of sound between <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> and <span class="accented">Meorasah</span>, "Betrothed" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), "Thou shalt give dismissal (bill of divorcement) to the city once betrothed to thee." Moresheth-Gath, Micah's birthplace, is placed just south of Beit Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, about twenty-five miles from Gaza (see Introduction, &sect; II.). The addition of Gath to the name of the town is meant to mark its situation in the immediate neighbourhood of that well known city. So we have Bethlehem-Judah (<a href="../../par/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), Abel-Maim or Maachah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>).

Ain Kezbeh</span>, eight miles north of Adullam, is probably the same as Chezib (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), where Shelah, Judah's son by Tamar, was born. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Israel.</span> "Israel" is here equivalent to Judah, having, according to the prediction of vers. 6, 7, lost its political existence (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>, where Ahaz is called King of Israel).

The "heir" is the Assyrian king, Sargon, into whose possession the city shall pass. Mareshah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>) was near Achzib, one mile southcast of Beit Jibrin, and is now  called <span class="accented">Mer'ash</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall come,</span> etc.; better, <span class="accented">the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nobility (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>) of Israel shall fly for refuge to such places as the cave of Adullam, David's asylum (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>).

But Rosenmuller, Henderson, Pusey, and others take the sentence as in the Authorized Version, making "the glory of Israel" in apposition with "Adullam," and understanding by "he" the heir or enemy. One knows no reason why Aduliam should be honoured with the above-named title; so the rendering given above is preferable. There is probably a paronomasia intended, "The glory of the Lord shall set (<span class="accented">ad olam</span>) forever." The city of Adullam, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Aid-el-Mah</span>, lay in the valley of Elah, ten miles northwest of Hebron, halfway between Sochoh and Keilah. It was of great antiquity, being mentioned as the birthplace of Hirah, the friend of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a>), and one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). In its neighbourhood is the celebrated cave, Mugha et Khureitun, which is pointed out as the traditional hold of David, and which has been carefully explored by Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 332, etc.).

(Pusey). The Syriac coincides with the LXX. By taking the three words as cognates, we get a very forcible sentence; but most modern commentators consider <span class="accented">niheyah</span> not a feminine formation, butniph. of the substantive verb <span class="accented">hayah</span>; hence the words would mean, "Lament with the lamentation;" "It is done," they shall say; "we are utterly spoiled." Thus Cheyne. The lamentation begins with "It is done," and continues to the end of the verse. The verbs are used impersonally - "one shall take up," "one shall lament," "one shall say;" but it is plain that the last two refer to the Jews who shall utter the given dirge, which in turn shall be repeated as a taunt by the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">We are utterly spoiled.</span> According to the second of the explanations of the preceding clause, these words expand and define the despairing cry, "It is done!" In the other case, they are the commencement of the lamentation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "We are miserably miserable." The complaint is twofold. First, the once flourishing condition of Israel is changed to ruin and desolation. Secondly, <span class="cmt_word">He hath changed</span> (<span class="accented">changeth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the portion of my people.</span> This is the second calamity: he, Jehovah, passes our inheritance over to the hands of others; the land of Canaan, pledged to us, is transferred to our enemies.

Turning away he hath divided our fields;  rather, <span class="accented">to an apostate he</span> <span class="accented">divideth our fields.</span> The apostate is the King of Assyria or Chaldea; and he is so named as being a rebel against Jehovah, whom he might have known by the light of natural religion (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). This was fulfilled later by the colonization of Samaria by a mixed population.

The "line" is the measuring line used in dividing land, as <a href="../../par/amos/7-17.htm">Amos 7:17</a>.

Hitzig, Reuss, and Orelli suppose that this verse contains a threat against Micah himself on the part of the ungodly Jews, intimating that they will punish him for presuming to prophesy against them, and that he shall die without leaving children. But this seems far fetched and inadmissible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Prophesy ye not, <i>say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-11.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">The threat announced in ver.</span> 3 <span class="accented">is further vindicated and applied to individual sinners, with a glance at the false prophets who taught the people to love lies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy ye not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">drop ye not</span>, as <a href="../../par/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> (where see note). The speakers are generally supposed to be the false prophets who wish to stop the mouths of Micah and those who are like minded with him. This is probably correct; but these are not the only speakers; the people themselves, the oppressing grandees, who side with the popularity hunting seers, are also included (see note on ver. 12). Say they to them that <span class="cmt_word">prophesy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thus they prophesy</span> (<span class="accented">drop</span>). Micah uses their own word sarcastically, "Do not be always rebuking; Thus they rebuke." The rest of the verse belongs to the same speakers, and should be rendered, "They shall not prophesy of these things; reproaches never cease." The great men and the false prophets complain of the true prophets that they are always proclaiming misfortune and rebuking the people, and they bid them leave such denunciations alone for the future. The passage is very difficult, and its interpretation has greatly exercised commentators; the above is virtually the explanation of Ewald, Hitzig, Caspari, and Cheyne. Orelli makes the two last clauses Micah's answer to the interdict of the adversaries, "Should one not prophesy of these things? Should reproaches (against the true prophets) never cease?" We prefer the interpretations given above, and consider the prophet's reply to be given in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">O <i>thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The prophet answers the interdict of the speakers in the preceding verse by showing that God's attributes are unchanged, but that the sins of the people constrain him to punish. <span class="cmt_word">O thou that art named the house of Jacob.</span> Other renderings of these words are given, viz. "Ah! what a saying!" or, "Is this a thing to be said, O house of Jacob?" The versions of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3b2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., and of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dicit domus Jacob</span>, do not suit the Hebrew. If we adopt the rendering of the Authorized Version, we must consider that Micah addresses those who gloried in their privilege as the family of Jacob, though they had ceased to be what he was, believing and obedient. "O ye who are only in name and title the chosen nation" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33, 39</a>). Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1887) obtains the very suitable meaning, <span class="accented">Num dicendum</span>, "Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the ear of the Lord shortened?" etc., by the change of a vowel point. Somewhat similarly Orelli, "Is this the speech of the house of Jacob?" viz. - Should Jehovah be impatient (as these threats declare him to be)? or were these his doings? The following clause is Jehovah's answer to the objection. <span class="cmt_word">Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?</span> or, <span class="accented">shortened</span>. Is he less long suffering than Jehovah of heretofore? Will you accuse Jehovah of impatience? "Shortness" of spirit is opposed to longanimity (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are these his doings?</span> Are these judgments and chastisements his usual doings that which he delights in? Is the cause of them in him? Is it not in you (<a href="../../par/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">Do not my words do good,</span> etc.? This may be Jehovah's answer to the previous questions, or Micah's refutation of the complaint. The Lord's word is good, his action is a blessing, but only to him who does his commandments (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>).

This translation obviates the difficulty of referring the words, "my people," in this verse to the oppressor, and in ver. 7 to the oppressed. According to the usual view, and retaining the authorized rendering, the meaning is that the princes exhibit themselves as enemies of the Lord by their acts of violence and oppression, which the prophet proceeds to particularize. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, "My people withstood as an enemy." <span class="cmt_word">Ye pull off the robe with the garment;</span> <span class="accented">ye violently strip off the robe away from the garment.</span> The "robe" (<span class="accented">eder</span>) is the wide cloak, the mantle sufficient to wrap the whole person, and which was often of very costly material.

There may be an allusion to the enactment which forbade a creditor retaining the pledged garment during the night (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.).

Hitzig considers that the reference is to fugitives from the northern kingdom who passed through Judaea in their endeavour to escape the evils of the war, leaving wives and children in the hands of the Judaeans. But these treated the refugees harshly.

The oppressors never repented or tried to make restitution; and so they incurred the special woe of those who injure the poor, the fatherless, and the widow (Pusey).

Some commentators, indeed, regard this and the following verso as the language of the false prophets; others, as a denunciation of punishment, not a promise of deliverance; others, as a late interpolation. But the style is entirely Micah's (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6, 7</a>), the promise is a true one, and such like sudden transitions are common in the prophetical books (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>); so that we need not resort to the hypothesis that some connecting link has dropped out of the text, or that the clause is misplaced; and we are fully justified in considering the paragraph as inserted here in its right position, and as predictive of the restoration of the Jews after captivity. Micah would seem to imply - I am not, indeed, as one of the false prophets who promise you earthly good without regard to your moral fitness for receiving God's bounty; neither am I one who has no message but of woe and calamity; I, too, predict salvation and happiness for a remnant of you after you have been tried by defeat and exile. <span class="cmt_word">I will surely assemble.</span> This presupposes dispersion among the heathen, such as is foretold in <a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, etc.; Micah 2:4, etc. <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob, all of thee.</span> The promise extends to the whole nation, whether called Jacob or Israel, as <a href="../../par/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <span class="cmt_word">but still only a remnant,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that portion of the nation which should make a good use of adversity, and turn to the Lord with sincere repentance (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>,. etc.). Some see in the term "remnant" an allusion to the people that were left in the northern kingdom after the fall of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">As the sheep of Bozrah.</span> There were two or more towns so named - one in Sidon, for which see note on Amos 1:12; and another, <span class="accented">hod. Buzrah</span>, on the south border of the Hauran. This is mentioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, as one of the cities of Moab, a district celebrated for its flocks (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>); hence "sheep of Bozrah" may have become a proverbial saying. Many commentators take <span class="accented">Botsrah as</span> an appellative, meaning "fold," in agreement with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi gregem in ovili</span>, and Chaldee, as well as Aquila and Symmachus. The parallelism in the following words seems to favour this view. The LXX. reads differently, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "in trouble." Thus, too, the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">As the flock in the midst of their fold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as a flock in the midst of its pasture</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall make great noise,</span> etc. Like a numerous flock bleating in its fold, so shall the returned Israelites be, prosperous and happy, celebrating their salvation with praise and exultation (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breaker is come</span> (<span class="accented">gone</span>) <span class="cmt_word">up before them.</span> Micah depicts Israel's redemption under the figure of release from captivity. The passage is clearly Messianic, and can neither be considered an interpolation nor tortured into a declaration of the siege and ruin of Samaria or Jerusalem. "One that breaketh" is a liberator, a leader that overcomes all obstacles which oppose Israel's return. There may be an allusion in the first instance to a human leader, such as Zerubbabel, in analogy with Moses and Joshua in old time, but the real conqueror intended is generally regarded as Messiah. The Breaker up is supposed to be a title of the Messiah well known to the Jews (see Pusey; and Pearson, 'Exposition of the Creed,' art. 7, note y). This interpretation is rejected by Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April 1887), who considers the "breaker up" to be "either a leader or a detachment of men, whose duty it was to break up walls or other obstacles opposing the progress of an army." But is not this to introduce an agency unknown to these times? Was there any special body of men trained and maintained for this particular duty? This "breaker up," according to Dr. Driver's conception, "advances before them, breaking through the gates of the prison in which the people are confined; they follow, marching forth triumphantly through this open way; their king, with Jehovah at his side (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), heads the victorious procession (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">They have broken up;</span> <span class="accented">broken forth</span>, or <span class="accented">through.</span> The captives cooperate with their leader. <span class="cmt_word">Have passed through the gate,</span> etc. The prophet speaks of a solemn, regular removal, like the Exodus from Egypt, which no human power can oppose. <span class="cmt_word">Their king.</span> The same as Jehovah in the next clause (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). He shall lead the host, as he headed the Israelites  when they left the house of bondage (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The prediction may look forward to the final gathering of Israel, which St. Paul seems to contemplate when he writes, "And so all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../micah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Micah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Micah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../micah/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Micah 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Micah 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/micah/3.htm"><title>Micah 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/micah/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/micah/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/micah/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../micah/2.htm" title="Micah 2">&#9668;</a> Micah 3 <a href="../micah/4.htm" title="Micah 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <i>Is it</i> not for you to know judgment?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 5:15</span>. - Part II.

There is a passage in Wisdom (12:5) which somewhat countenances the idea that the Canaanites were guilty of this enormity, but it is probably only a rhetorical exaggeration of the writer.

The antithesis of the following clause seems to require this explanation, which is further supported by the Chaldee. But it is quite unprecedented to find the word translated "bite" (<span class="accented">nashakh</span>) in the sense of "eat," or as it is taken here, "to have something to eat;" wherever it occurs it means "to bite like a serpent," to wound (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The parallelism of the succeeding member does not compel us to put a forced interpretation upon the word.

There may be allusion to the religious rites accompanying a declaration of war (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>); but Micah seems to mean that, if the customary bribes are withheld, these prophets announce war and calamity as inevitable; they proclaim them in God's name, as speaking with his sanction and under his Inspiration (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; see note on Zephaniah 1:7).

As commonly, the restoration from captivity and the privileges of Messiah's kingdom are combined in one foreshortened view. But this "remnant" shall be made into a strong nation, which no power shall overthrow (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; 55:22). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall reign over them.</span> Not through an earthly representative, but by himself (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In Mount Zion.</span> This prophecy does not necessarily point to any literal earthly fulfilment, but rather to the establishment of Christ's spiritual kingdom, and the revelation of that new Jerusalem which St. John saw "descending out of heaven from God" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">After a certain period of calamity and captivity the kingdom of David shall be revived.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, O tower of the flock</span> (<span class="accented">migdal-edar</span>). There was a village with a tower so called near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>), and it is thought that Micah refers to it as the home of David and as destined to be the birthplace of Messiah. But the context compels us to consider the expression as a periphrasis for Jerusalem, which the prophet here addressee, declaring that the royal power shall be restored to her. It is evidently the same place as <span class="cmt_word">the stronghold</span> (<span class="accented">ophel</span>, "the hill") <span class="cmt_word">of the daughter of Zion.</span> The name "Ophel" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and on it were the king's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old palace of David, and "the tower that lieth out," or the upper tower (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26, 27</a>). This is probably the "flock tower" mentioned in the text (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the usa of the term "flock tower" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding  verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders <span class="accented">Ophel</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "dark;" so Jerome, "nebulosa;" Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. The verb "shall come" is better taken with "the first dominion," and this clause in apposition to the former, "the kingdom of" or "the reign over the daughter of Jerusalem." Sovereignty over Jerusalem, or, as others take it, that appertains to Jerusalem, represents rule over the whole country. In Messiah the glory and power are restored to the throne of David (<a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>).

The loss of the king, the representative of the help and favour of God, was a token of the withdrawal of the Divine protection (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy counsellor.</span> A synonym for "king." Cheyne notes that the root of <span class="accented">melech</span> ("king") in Aramaic means "to counsel." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> Messiah is called "Counsellor." The Septuagint, treating the word as a collective, renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "thy counsel." <span class="cmt_word">Pangs</span>, etc. The comparison of sorrow of heart to the anguish of labour pains is very common (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; 6:43; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>).

He says "now,"as having the scene before his eyes. They must leave their city, live shelterless in the open country, be carried to a distant land, even to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell in the field;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while they are making their way to the place of their captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall go even to Babylon.</span> This is simple prophecy, and could have been known to Micah only by inspiration. In his day Assyria was the enemy whom Israel had to dread (as <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5, 6</a>), Babylon being at this time in the position of a conquered country, and not becoming again powerful and independent for another century, So Isaiah prophesied of the captivity to Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3-8</a>), if modern critics have not shaken our faith in the genuineness of that chapter. Micah does not define the time of the Captivity, or the agents; he notes merely the place whither the Jews were at last to be deported. Even in this case "Babylon" may have its typical import, and be taken to represent the great world power arrayed against the chosen race; and the prophecy may look forward to other fulfilments in succeeding ages. Some commentators think that Babylon is here mentioned as the most distant country known, or as a portion of the Assyrian empire. Others suppose that Sargon transported some Israelitish captives to Babylon to replace the rebellious Babylonians whom he exiled to Palestine ('Records of the Past,' 7:29; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), and that thus Micah was naturally led to represent the Judaeans as following their brethren. Whichever explanation we take, there is no reason to consider that the reference to Babylon is the interpolation of a late editor of the prophetic writings. <span class="cmt_word">There shall thou be delivered.</span> In Babylon deliverance shall arise. This prophecy was first literally fulfilled in the return from captivity under Cyrus; it is further fulfilled, under Christ, in the rescue of the true Israelites from the bondage of sin and the world.

Pusey thinks that the reference is rather to the attacks of petty enemies, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Maccabean times, and in the Samaritans' opposition to the rebuilding of the temple.

The metaphor is carried on in the next verse. Various are the explanations of the prophet's reference in this prophecy. Many commentators see in it a reference to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); others discern a defeat of the Scythians after the return from captivity; others, again, place it in the times of the Maccabees; and others interpret it of the defeat of the mystical adversaries of God's Church adumbrated in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>; and <a href="../../par/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>. But the prophet has not one definite event in view, but looks forward to the general conflict between the powers of the world and the Church, of which the historical events and material enemies were the types. Certain historical circumstances may exactly suit the prediction, but they do not exhaust it. And indeed we do wrong to seek for minute and definite fulfilment of particular predictions. Such utterances are often conditional and are modified by subsequent circumstances. The prophets are concerned with great moral truths and the righteous government of the world, and are not always to be interpreted with literal exactness.

Pusey considers that she is so called from the acts of violence, robbery, and bloodshed which are done within her (<a href="../../par/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>).

To smite upon the cheek is the grossest insult (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>) When Zion is thus besieged, and its rulers suffer the utmost contumely, its condition must look hopeless, Such a state of things was realized in the treatment of Zedekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.), and in many subsequent sieges of Jerusalem. But the underlying idea is that Israel shall suffer dire distress at the hands of her enemies until Messiah comes, and she herself turns to the Lord. The LXX. translates <span class="accented">shophet</span>, "judge," by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "tribes," but the other Greek translators give <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>.

This passage was quoted by the Sanhedrin to answer Herod's question where the Christ was to be born (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5, 6</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah.</span> Ephratah (Ephrathah, or Ephrath), "fruitfulness," is another name for Bethlehem, "House of bread" (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>); from its position it is also called Bethlehem Judah (<a href="../../par/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), being situated in the tribal lot of Judah, about five miles south of Jerusalem, and thus distinguished from a town of the same name in Zebulun(<a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>).

"And thou, Bethlehem, house of Ephrathah." The rest of the clause is best translated, <span class="accented">too little to be among the thousands of Judah</span>. Each tribe was divided into "thousands," which would be equivalent to clans, with its own head. Probably the reckoning was made of fighting men (see note on Zechariah 9:7; and comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-21.htm">Joshua 22:21, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>). Bethlehem, called in the text Bethlehem Ephratah for solemnity's sake, was a small place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>), of such slight importance as not to be named among the possessions of Judah in <a href="../../par/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15</a>, or in the catalogue of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yet out of thee shall he</span> (<span class="accented">one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel.</span> In spite of its insignificance, this birthplace of David shall be the birthplace of Messiah. "Shall some forth" is spoken sometimes of birth and descent, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and Genesis 35:11; at other times it contains merely the notion of proceeding from, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. In the present ease both ideas are suitable. <span class="accented">Unto me</span> (Jehovah is speaking). To my praise and glory, to do my will. Micah by these words would recall the announcement concerning David made to Samuel, "I have provided me a king" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), and thus show the typical relation of David to the Messiah (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting</span>. The meaning of the word rendered "goings forth" (<span class="accented">motsaoth</span>) is somewhat doubtful. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">egressus</span>. The Fathers see in it a declaration of the eternal generation of the Son: he who was born in time at Bethlehem hath an eternal existence. In this case the plural form of the word is a plural of majesty, or an abstract expression (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>, "dominions;" <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. "habitations"). To Christians, who believe in the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the plural would express the continual generation or the Son from the Father from everlasting and to everlasting, never beginning and never ending; as the Council of Lateran says, "Without beginning ever and  without end, the Father begetting, the Sen being born (<span class="accented">nascens</span>), and the Holy Ghost proceeding." Many commentators take the "goings forth" to be the ancient promises, the revelations of the Angel of the covenant to the patriarchs, the various preparations made in type and history for the appearance of the great Son of David in due time; but this is a forced interpretation of the word. Granted that Micah's contemporaries understood the prophecy to state merely that a Saviour should arise from the lineage of David who traced his descent from hoar antiquity, and might be said to have lived in the days of old, this fact (if it be a fact) does not preclude us, with our more perfect knowledge, from seeing a deeper meaning in the inspired utterance, an adumbration of the nature of that Prince whom Isaiah calls "Everlasting" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), the Word who "was in the beginning with God" (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 2</a>). We may note certain contrasts in these two first verses. Zion, "the daughter of troops," is contrasted with the mean and insignificant Bethlehem; yet the former shall be shamefully handled, the latter highly honoured; that one's king shall be dethroned and disgraced, this one's Ruler is from everlasting and to everlasting.

This presupposes that the house of David will have lost the throne and have been reduced to a low condition. <span class="cmt_word">Will he give them up.</span> Jehovah will give up the people to its enemies; this is the way in which the house of David shall come to low estate. <span class="cmt_word">She which travaileth hath brought forth.</span> Many commentators have taken the travailing woman to be the afflicted community of Israel, or Zion; but we may not altogether reject the old interpretation which regards this as a prophecy of the birth of Christ from the Virgin, in accordance with the received Messianic exposition of Isaiah's great prediction, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Such an announcement comes in naturally after the announcement of the Ruler coming forth from Bethlehem.

Bishop Butler, in his sermon "Upon the Character of Balaam," adopts the view that Balak is the speaker of vers. 6 and 7, and Balaam answers in ver. 8. Knabenbauer considers Micah himself as the interlocutor, speaking in the character of the people; which makes the apparent change of persons in ver. 8 very awkward. Most commentators, ancient and modern, take the questions in vers. 6 and 7 to be asked by the people personified, though they are not agreed as to the spirit from which they proceed, some thinking that they are uttered in self-righteousness, as if the speakers had done all that and more than could be required of them; others regarding the inquiries as representing a certain acknowledgment of sin and a desire for means of propitiation, though there is exhibited a want of appreciation of the nature of God and of the service which alone is acceptable to him. The latter view is most reasonable, and in accordance with Micah's manner. <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with what offering?

The alteration has been introduced probably with some idea of making the parallelism more exact. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I give my firstborn?</span> Micah exactly represents the people's feeling; they would do anything but what God required; they would make the costliest sacrifice, even, m their exaggerated devotion, holding themselves ready to make a forbidden offering; but they would not attend to the moral requirements of the Law. It is probably by a mere hyperbole that the question in the text is asked. The practice of human sacrifice was founded on the notion that man ought to offer to God his dearest and costliest, and that the acceptability of an offering was proportioned to its preciousness. The Hebrews had learned the custom from their neighbours, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Phoenicians and Moabites (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), and had for centuries offered their children to Moloch, in defiance of the stern prohibitions of Moses and their prophets (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). They might have learned, from many facts and inferences, that man's self-surrender was not to be realized by this ritual; the sanctity of human life (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), the substitution of the ram for Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), the redemption of the firstborn (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>), all made for this truth.

This might well be a comfort to the Israelites when they heard that they were doomed to be cast out of their country, and that the temple was to be destroyed, and that the ritual on which they laid such stress would for a time become impracticable. So the inculcation of moral virtues is often connected with the prediction of woe or captivity. (For the prophetic view of the paramount importance of righteousness, see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.: 1. 8, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc.; see on Zechariah 7:7.) <span class="cmt_word">To do justly.</span> To act equitably, to hurt nobody by word or deed, which was the exact contrary of the conduct previously mentioned (<a href="../../par/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1, 2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To love mercy.</span> To be guided in conduct to others by loving kindness. These two rules contain the whole duty to the neighbour. Compare Christ's description of genuine religion (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To walk humbly with thy God.</span> This precept comprises man's duty to God, humility and obedience. "To walk" is an expression implying "to live and act" as the patriarchs are said to have "walked with God," denoting that they lived as consciously under his eye and referred all their actions to him. Humility is greatly enforced in the Scriptures (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, etc.).

The reading is uncertain. Others render, "Blessed is he who sees thy Name;" but the construction is against this. Others, "Thy Name looketh to wisdom" (or prosperity), has the true wisdom of life in sight. The versions read "fear" for "see." Thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "Shall save those that fear his Name;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Salus erit timentibus Nomen tuum</span>; Syriac, "He imparts instruction to those that fear his Name;" Chaldee, "The teachers fear his Name." This reading depends upon a change of vowel pointing. Orelli renders, "Happy is he who fears thy Name." The Authorized translation, which seems on the whole to be well established, takes the abstract noun "wisdom" as equivalent to "the wise," or "the man of wisdom." For similar expressions, Henderson refers to <a href="../../par/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>-4; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>.

The Authorized Version regards the speaker as the same as in ver. 10, and translates with some violence to the text. It may be that the prophet speaks as the representative of the awakened transgressor, "Can I be guiltless with such deceit about me?" But the sudden change of personification and of state of feeling is very harsh. Hence some follow Jerome in regarding God as the speaker, and rendering, "Shall I justify the wicked balance?" others, the Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; "Shall the wicked be justified by the balance?" Cheyne is inclined to read the verb in the second person, "Canst thou (O Jerusalem) be pure?" since in the next verse the prophet proceeds, "the rich men thereof" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Jerusalem). If we retain the present reading, "Can I be innocent?" we must consider the question as put, for effect's sake, in the mouth of one of the rich oppressors. Jerome's translation is contrary to the use of the verb, which is always intransitive in kal.

It is most suitable to understand this clause as connected with the preceding threat of hunger, and to take the unusual word in the sense of "emptiness." Thus, "Thy emptiness (of stomach) shall remain in thee." Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>)speaks of the famine in the city at the time of its siege. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take hold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt remove</span> (<span class="accented">thy goods</span>).

The decree (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>) is explained by Hengstenberg and many commentators, ancient and modern, to he that of the enemy by which they held Israel captive. Keil and others suppose the law to be meant which separated Israel from all other nations, the ancient ordinance which confined God's people and the blessings of the theocracy to narrow limits. This is now to be set aside (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-16</a>), when heathen nations flock to the city of God.

The miraculous deliverance of the Israelites at the Exodus is a type of the greater deliverance of the true Israelites in Christ (<a href="../../par/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <i>and</i> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt perform</span> (literally, <span class="accented">give</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham.</span> Jacob and Abraham are mentioned as the chiefs and representatives of the chosen family; and "the truth" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's faithfulness to his promises) and "mercy" are equally given to both, separately assigned only for the sake of the parallelism. Knabenbaner compares such passages as <a href="../../par/psalms/114-1.htm">Psalm 114:1</a>, "When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language" (Psalm or. 6; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>, etc.). The general meaning, therefore, is that God will perform the promises made to the forefathers, as <a href="../../par/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Hast sworn,</span> as in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. etc.; Genesis 28:13, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-12.htm">Deuteronomy 7:12</a>. With the close of the ode Hengstenberg compares <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>. Thus the checkered prophecy ends with the glow of faith and happy hope. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../micah/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Micah 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Micah 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nahum/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nahum 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nahum 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
