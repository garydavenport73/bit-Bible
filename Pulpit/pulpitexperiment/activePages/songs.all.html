The Septuagint has simply the title <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, So that our English title in the Authorized Version, 'The Song of Solomon,' has no ancient authority. It is well altered in the Revised Version to 'The Song of Songs.' The word "song" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) does not necessarily convey the meaning. composed to be sung to music. If the performance of the words were chiefly in view, the word would have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">carmen</span>, "lyric poem," "hymn," or "ode." The Greek <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin of the Vulgate<span class="accented">, Canticum canticorum</span>, accord with the Hebrew in representing the work as taking a high place either in the esteem of the Church or, on account of the subject, in the esteem of the writer. Luther expresses the same idea in the title he attaches to it, 'Das Hohelied,' that is, the chief or finest of songs. The reference may be to the excellence of the literary form, but probably that which suggested the title was the supreme beauty of the love which prompted the songs. The title may be regarded as applied to the whole book, or to the first portion of it giving the name to the whole. If it be a collection of separate songs strung together, as some think) by mere resemblance in style and subject, then the words, "which is Solomon's" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) apply to the first song alone. But the unity which is clearly to be traced through the book to the end makes it probable that the title is meant to ascribe the work to the authorship of Solomon. This is the opinion of the majority of critics. It must have come either from the wise king himself, or from some one of his contemporaries or immediate successors. The preposition is the <span class="accented">lamedh auctoris.</span> If the meaning were "referring to," another preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) would have been employed. It has been remarked by Delitzsch that the absence of any description of Solomon as "King of Israel" or "son of David," as in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, confirms the view that Solomon himself was the sole author. Some have argued against the authenticity of the title on the ground that the longer form of the relative, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, is used in it, whereas in the book itself the shorter form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;</span>, is found, but no dependence, can be placed on that argument regarded by itself, for the same writer employs both forms, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jeremiah, who uses the longer form in his prophecies and the shorter in Lamentations. The shorter form is, in fact, the elder, being Old Canaanitish or Phoenician, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which is a lengthened form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and afterwards became <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>. One writer, however Fleischer), holds that the relative pronoun as a substantive origin, and compares it with the Arabic <span class="accented">ithe</span> and the Assyrian <span class="accented">asar</span>, meaning "track" or "place," like the German <span class="accented">welcher</span>, which comes from <span class="accented">wo.</span> But whether this be so or not, it is certainly unsafe to date any book by the form found in it of the, relative pronoun. We know that in poetry the abbreviated form is common. It was probably a North Palestine provincialism, as we see in the Book of Kings. It became common in prose writings after the Captivity because of the degradation of Hebrew, but it was not unknown before that time either in prose or poetry. With regard to the exact description of the poetic form of the Song of Songs, the difference among critics is considerable, but the question is scarcely worth discussing. There undoubtedly is unity of  conception in the songs which are brought together, but it cannot be of importance to prove that there is dramatic unity strictly speaking; there is no dramatic procedure, nor can we suppose that there is any ultimate aim at dramatic representation. But the Exposition which follows will suffice to show that there are facts of history in the background of the poem; if the suggestions of the language and scenery be followed, the facts are very beautiful and even romantic - the love of the great king for one of his own subjects, a lovely northern maiden, whose simplicity and purity of character are a great attraction and lend much force to the religious sentiment of the song. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a> we read that "the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him." That divinely inspired wisdom enabled him, notwithstanding his own personal errors, to idealize and sanctify the lovely episode of his lifo which lies at the foundation of his poem. And the Church of God in every age has appreciated, more or less widely, the inspiration, both of matter and of form, which breathed in it. We are told that Solomon composed one thousand and five songs (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>); whether this is a part of that collection or not we cannot certainly say, but that it is a mere <span class="accented">fasciculus</span>, or collection of separate songs, strung together by their general erotic character, is what we cannot believe. No doubt, as Dr. Mason Good has observed, the Arabian poets were accustomed to arrange their poems in what they compared to a string of pearls, but we can scarcely carry such a fact into the Bible, and deal with sacred books as mere literary remains. There must be a deep religious meaning in such language, and it is in accordance with Eastern usage that amatory songs should be so employed. What the meaning is we must persistently ask, and however much has been wrongly said in the past, while we believe in the Divine authority of the Old Testament we must not renounce the endeavour to find the Song of Songs worthy of its title and its place. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-2.htm">Song of Solomon 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <i>is</i> better than wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2-ch. 2:7.</span> - Part I. MUTUAL LOVE. Song of Shulamith in the royal chambers. Chorus of ladies, daughters of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</span> Whether we take these words as put in the lips of the bride herself, or of the chorus as identifying themselves with her, is of little consequence. It is certain that the idea intended to be expressed is that of delight in the approach of the royal bridegroom. The future is used optatively, "Let me be taken up into the closest fellowship and embrace." All attempts to dispense with the amatory phraseology are vain. The "kisses" must be interpreted in a figurative sense, or the sacred character of the whole book must be removed. The words may be rendered, <span class="accented">with one of his kisses</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sweetness of his lips is such that one kiss would be rapture. Some have thought that allusion is intended to the custom among idolaters referred to in <a href="../../par/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a>, "My mouth hath kissed my hand;" but the meaning is simply that of affection. The great majority of Christian commentators have regarded the words as expressive of desire towards God. Origen said, the Church of the old dispensation longing after higher revelations, as through the Incarnation, "How long shall he send me kisses by Moses and the prophets? I desire the touch of his own lips." It is dangerous to attempt specific applications of a metaphor. The general truth of it is all that need be admitted. If the relation between God and his people is one that can be set forth under the image of human affection, then there is no impropriety in the language of Solomon's Song. "To kiss a kiss" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is the ordinary Hebraic form (cf. "to counsel a counsel"). <span class="accented">Thy love is better than wine.</span> The plural is used, "loves," as in the word "life" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) - the abstract for the concrete, perhaps in order to indicate the manifestation of love in many caresses. The change from the third person to the second is common in poetry. The comparison with wine may be taken either as denoting sweetness or exhilarating effects. The intoxicating power of wine is but rarely referred to in Scripture, as the ordinary wine was distinguished from strong drink. Some, as Hitzig and Bottcher, would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, changing the pointing, and translating, "Let him give me to drink;" but there is no necessity for a reading so forced and vulgar. The Septuagint, altering the vowels of the word "love," turn it into "breasts," and must therefore have supposed it addressed to the bride. The word is connected with the Arabic, and runs through the languages, <span class="accented">dodh</span> (cf. Dada, Dido, David). Perhaps the reference to wine, as subsequently to the ointments, may be explained by the fact that the song is supposed to be sung while wine is presented in the chamber, and while the perfumes are poured out in preparation for the entrance of the royal bridegroom. We can scarcely doubt that the opening words are intended to be the utterance of loving desire on the part of the bride in the presence of the daughters of Jerusalem. Some have suggested that vers. 1-8 are from a kind of responsive dialogue, but the view of the older interpreters and of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Weissbach, and others of the moderns, seems more correct, that all the first seven verses are in the mouth of Shulamith, and then ver. 8 comes in naturally  as a chorus in reply to the song of the bride. The use of the plural, "We will run after thee," etc., is easily explicable. The bride is surrounded by her admiring companions and attendants. They are congratulating her on the king's love. She speaks as from the midst of the company of ladies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-3.htm">Song of Solomon 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <i>is as</i> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee.</span> There is some slight difference among critics as to the rendering of this verse, but it does not affect the meaning. Lovely and delightful thou art. As thy perfumes are so precious, so is thy name; the more it is spread, the more delight is found in it. The idea is that the person is the sweetest, and that his communications are elevating and inspiring. The "virgins" may be taken generally, "Those who are full of the sensibility of youth appreciate thy attractions." The word <span class="accented">almah</span> is much disputed about, but the meaning is simply that of "young woman," whether virgin or married. "Thou art the delight of all the young." Mason Good renders the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Rich thy perfumes; but richer far than they<br />The countless charms that round thy person play;<br />Thy name alone, more fragrant than the rose,<br />Glads every maid, where'er its fragrance flows."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-4.htm">Song of Solomon 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will make mention of thy love more than of wine: rightly do they love thee.</span> This is best taken as all spoken by the bride. It is the language of the purest affection and adoring admiration. "I drew them," God says (<a href="../../par/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>), "with cords of a man, with bands of love." "The Lord appeared of old unto me," says Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), "saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee." In the same sense the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used by our Lord himself of the Father <span class="accented">drawing</span> to the Son, and of the Son, uplifted on the cross, "drawing" all men unto him (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). If the spiritual meaning of the whole poem is admitted, such language is quite natural. The king's chambers are the king's own rooms in the palace, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his sleeping, rooms and sitting rooms - the <span class="accented">penetralia regis.</span> We may take the preterite as equivalent to the present; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The king is bringing me into closest fellowship with himself, not merely as a member of his household, but as his chosen bride." The concluding words have caused much discussion. The meaning, however, is the same whether we say, "The upright love thee," or "Thou art rightly loved." The intention is to set forth the object of love as perfect. The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, is used to signify the abstract of the word, thought, or act; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "righteous," for "rightly" (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>); but the best critics think it could not be the abstract for the concrete plural, as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Recti diligunt re.</span> The same use of the word is seen in eh. 7:9, "The best wine that teeth down <span class="accented">smoothly</span> for my beloved" (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a>). Before going further in the song, it is well to observe how chaste, pure, and delicate is the language of love; and yet, as Delitzsch has pointed out, there is a mystical, cloudy brightness. We seem to be in the region of the ideal. It is not a mere love song, though it may have been the commemoration of an actual past. The Eastern form of the words may be less suited to our taste than it would be to those who first embraced Christianity, and to the nineteenth century than to the first; but the loving rapture of the Church in fellowship with the Saviour is certainly seeking a more vivid expression in song, and there are many of the most simple-minded and devoted Christians whose joy in Christ pours itself out freely in strains not much less fervid and almost as sensuous as anything to be found in Solomon's Song. Some are beginning to remonstrate against this freedom of devotional language, but the instinct of the Church seems to justify it as the demand of the heart under the influence of the Word of God itself. Perhaps there is a state of religious feeling coming into the experience of Christians which will remove the veil from such a book as the Song of Songs, and we shall yet find that its language is needful and is not extravagant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-5.htm">Song of Solomon 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</span> The word "black" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) does not necessarily mean that the skin is black, but rather sunburnt, dark brown, as in <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>, where the same word signifies the livid or swarthy appearance of one who has suffered long from famine and wretchedness. There is certainly no reason to take the word as an argument for the bride being Pharaoh's daughter; but it points to what is confirmed by the rest of the poem - the rustic birth and northern blood of the bride. She has been living in the fields, and is browned with the ruddy health of a country life. The best explanation of the words is that they are drawn out by the fact that the bride is surrounded by her ladies. Some think that they look askance at her, or with indignation at the boldness of her words; but that is quite unnecessary, and would be inconsistent with the dignity of the bride. The country  maiden feels the greatness of the honour, that she is chosen of the king, and with simple modesty, in the presence of courtly ladies around her, sets forth her claim. The simile is not uncommon in poetry, as in Theocritus and Virgil. <span class="accented">Comely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attractive, agreeable. <span class="accented">Kedar</span> (whether from the Arabic, meaning "powerful," or from the Hebrew, "black") designates the tribes of the North Arabian descendants of Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>), Kedareens, referred to by Pliny, and remaining in Arabia until the time of the Mohammedans. The Bedouin still calls his tent his "hair house;" it is covered with goat's-hair cloth, mostly black or grey. Whether the reference is to the colour of the goat's hair or to the tents being browned or blackened by the heat of the sun, we cannot doubt that the allusion is to the complexion, and the rest of the simile would then be applicable to the lovely shape and features of the maiden, the curtains of Solomon being the curtains of a pavilion, or pleasure tent, spread out like "a shining butterfly," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beautiful cloth or tapestry which formed the sides of the tent or the tent coverings, the clothing of the framework, or tent hangings (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>, etc.). Egyptian hangings were particularly prized. The custom prevailed among Eastern monarchs of sojourning once in the year in some lovely rural district, and at such times their tents would be very magnificent. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "as the skins of Solomon;" but this is a mistake. The word is derived from a root "to tremble," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to glitter in the sun." Those who desire to find an allegorical interpretation think there is an evident allusion here to the sojourn of Israel in the wilderness, or the admission of the Gentiles into the covenant; but there is no reason for any such strain upon the meaning. The simile is merely poetical. The soul realizes its own acceptance before God, but ascribes that acceptance to his grace. "The bride, the Lamb's wife," sees the beauty of the Lord reflected in herself, and rejoices in her own attractions for his sake. There is no immodesty in the consciousness of merit so long as that merit is ascribed to him from whom it comes. There is often more pride in the assumption of humility than in the claim to be acknowledged. The same apostle who declared himself less than the least of all saints also maintained that he was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-6.htm">Song of Solomon 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Look not upon me, because I <i>am</i> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; <i>but</i> mine own vineyard have I not kept.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun hath scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</span> The meaning seems to be - Do not let the swarthiness of my complexion lower me in your eyes. Literally the words are, <span class="accented">Do not see me that I am</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not regard me as being, because I am. There is no necessity to suppose any looks of the ladies to have suggested the words. They are the words of modest self-depreciation mingled with joyful sense of acceptance. It is difficult to render the Hebrew exactly. The word translated "swarthy" (<span class="accented">shecharchoreh</span>) is probably a diminutive from <span class="accented">shechorah</span>, which itself means "blackish;" so that the meaning is, "that my complexion is dark." The reference to the sun explains the word still further, as pointing, not to a difference of race, but to mere temporary effects of an outdoor life: "The sun has been playing with my complexion;" or, as the LXX. renders it, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "The sun has been gazing at me." So other Greek versions. Some, however, include the idea of burning or scorching, which is the literal meaning of the verb, though in <a href="../../par/job/3-9.htm">Job 3:9</a> and Job 41:10 it is used in the sense of looking at or upon. The sun is the eye of the heavens (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>), and with delicate feeling it is spoken of here as feminine, the bride playfully alluding, perhaps, to the lady seen in the heavens preceding the ladies of the court in gazing on her beauty. It is difficult to explain with perfect satisfaction the next clause of the verse. Doubtless "mother's sons" is a poetical periphrasis for brothers - <span class="accented">not</span> "step-brothers," as some have said. Perhaps the mother was a widow, as no father is mentioned. The best explanation is that the bride is simply giving an account of herself, why she is so browned in the sun. The brothers, for some reason, had been incensed against her, possibly on account of her favour in the eyes of the king, but more probably for private, family reasons. They would not have her shutting herself up in the house to take care of her complexion; they would have her in the vineyards. In the word "keeper" (<span class="accented">noterah</span> instead of <span class="accented">notzerah</span>) we have an instance of the northern dialect - a kind of Platt-Hebrew - hardening the pronunciation. <span class="accented">My own vineyard have I not kept</span> no doubt refers simply and solely to her complexion, not to her virginity or character. She means - I was compelled by my brothers to go into the vineyards in the heat of the sun, and the consequence was, as you see, I have not been able to preserve the delicacy of my skin; I have been careless of my personal beauty. The sun has done its work. The reference helps us to recognize the historical background of the poem, and leads naturally to the use of the pastoral language which runs through the whole. The king is a shepherd, and his bride a shepherdess. Without straining the spiritual interpretation, we may yet discover in this beautiful candour and  Simplicity of the bride the reflection of the soul's virtues in its joyful realization of Divine favour; but the true method of interpretation requires no minute, detailed adjustment of the language to spiritual facts, but rather seeks the meaning in the total impression of the poem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-7.htm">Song of Solomon 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest <i>thy flock</i> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where thou makest it to rest at noon: for why should I he as one that is veiled beside the flock of thy companions?</span> These words carry on the associations suggested by the previous verse. The bride is longing for the bridegroom; but she cannot think of him yet in any other light than as a companion of her simple country life - he is a shepherd, and she a shepherdess. "Take me into closer fellowship with thyself; let me not remain still only one amongst the many." Perhaps there is intended to be an allusion to the common metaphor - the king as the shepherd and the people as his flock; but the uppermost thought of the bride is separation unto her husband. The soul which longs for the enjoyment of fellowship with God desires to be carried away out of all distractions, out of all restraints, lifted above reserve and above doubt into the closest and most loving union. The idea of the veil may be either the veil of mourning or the veil of modesty and reserve. Probably the latter is the true reference. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. There is some difference of opinion among critics. Ewald thinks it refers to strangeness - "like one unknown," and therefore veiled; Gesenius says, "one fainting;" others connect the word with the root "to <span class="accented">roam</span>," "to <span class="accented">wander"</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>), which is confirmed by Symmachus, the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Chaldee, Jerome, Venetian, and Luther. The simplest explanation is that the bride compares herself, in her absence from her lord, among the ladies of the court, to a veiled woman travelling beside the flocks of the shepherds, seeking her friend, but not yet brought to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-8.htm">Song of Solomon 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - (<span class="accented">Chorus of ladies.</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</span> That another voice is here introduced there can be no doubt; and as it is not like the voice of the bridegroom himself, which is heard in the next verse, we must suppose it to be the chorus of attendant ladies. Delitzsch suggests very plausibly that they are pleasantly chiding the simplicity of the country maiden, and telling her that, if she cannot understand her position, she had better return to her country life. In that case, "if thou know not" would mean - If thou canst not rise up to thy privilege; the knowledge referred to being general knowledge or wisdom. The delicate irony is well expressed, as in the reference to the kids - "feed thy kids," like a child as thou art. But there may be no intentional irony in the words; rather a playful and sympathetic response to the beautiful simplicity of the bride - If thou art waiting to be brought to thy beloved, if thou art seeking thy shepherd, thou most lovely woman, then go quietly on thy way, like a shepherdess tending the kids beside the shepherds' tents; follow the peaceful footsteps of the flock, and in due time the beloved one will appear. This is better than to suppose the ladies presuming to indulge in irony when they must know that Shulamith is the king's favourite. Besides, the first scene of the poem, which is a kind of introduction, thus ends appropriately with an invitation to peaceful waiting for love. We are prepared for the entrance of the beloved one. The spiritual meaning is simple and clear - Those that would be lifted up into the highest enjoyments of religion must not be impatient and doubt that the Lord will reveal himself, but go quietly and patiently on with the work of life, "in the footsteps of the flock," in fellowship with humble souls, and in the paths of peace, in the green pastures and beside the still waters, ready to do anything assigned them, and the time of rejoicing and rapture will come. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-9.htm">Song of Solomon 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - (<span class="accented">Entrance of the bridegroom.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</span> There can be no reasonable doubt that these words are put into the mouth of the king. The "steed" is in the feminine (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>); some would point the word with the plural vowels, that is, "to my horses," or a "body of horses." There is no necessity for that. The reference to a particular very lovely mare is more apt and pointed. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a> we read in the LXX. Version of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which Solomon had for his chariots - fourteen hundred war chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. The Pharaoh chariots were those which the king had imported from Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-28.htm">2 Chronicles 9:28</a>). It may be that the reference is to the splendid decoration of the trappings. Delitzsch very rightly sees in such a figure a confirmation of the view that Solomon himself was the author. The horses from Egypt were famed at that time as those of Arabia became afterwards. The names both of horses and chariots in the Egyptian language were borrowed from the Semitic, as they were probably first imported into Egypt by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. Other examples of the same comparison are found in poetry, as in Horace, Anacreon, and Theocritus. In the last  ('Idyl.,' 18:30, 31) occur the following lines, rendered into English verse: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"As towers the cypress 'mid the garden's bloom,<br />As in the chariot proud Thessalian steed,<br />Thus graceful, rose-complexioned Helen moves."</span> The idea is that of stately beauty and graceful movements. The old commentators see the Divine love of espousals (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>), as in the wilderness of the Exodus, and afterwards in the wilderness of the world. The Bible is full of the expression of Divine tenderness and regard for man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thy cheeks are comely with rows <i>of jewels</i>, thy neck with chains <i>of gold</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, thy neck with strings of jewels. We will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver.</span> This language may be suggested by the comparison first employed - the trappings of the horse. "The head frame of the horse's bridle and the poitral were then certainly, just as now, adorned with silken tassels, fringes, and other ornaments of silver. <span class="accented">Torim</span>, 'round ornaments,' which hang down in front on both sides of the headband or are also inwoven in the braids of hair in the forehead." The strings of jewels were necklaces - three rows of pearls. The ornamentation is, however, quite in accordance with female dress. The king makes the promise of gold and silver decoration as an expression of his personal delight in his bride and acceptance of her. Gold and silver were closely connected; hence silver was called, in the Old Egyptian language, "white gold." The idea seems to be that of silver points sprinkled over golden knobs. Compare the description in 'Faust' of Margaret's delight in the casket she finds in her room. The LXX. and Vulgate have mistaken the word <span class="accented">torim</span> for a similar word for "doves," taking the simile to be the beautiful colours of the dove's neck. The bride does not seem to reply immediately to the king; but we may suppose that the king takes his bride by the hand, and leads her into the banqueting chamber. But the next three verses, which are certainly in the lips of the bride, may be taken as her expression of delight in her husband, either while he feasts in the banquet or when it is over. The banquet is a familiar emblem of the delight of mutual love. Hence the feasts of love in the primitive Church were regarded, not only as seasons of fellowship between Christians, but times of rejoicing, when the soul entered into the full appreciation of the Saviour's presence.

My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts. My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi.</span> The preterite is best taken poetically for the present. The words are evidently a response to those of the king. As such they refer to present feeling and not to a past state. The bride expresses her delight in the king. The table is used generally. The Hebrew word is from a root "to sit round." The habit of reclining at table was introduced much later, during the Persian, Greek, and Roman period. The spikenard was a powerful perfume, probably of Indian origin, as the Indian word <span class="accented">nalada</span>, meaning "that which yields fragrance," shows. The Persian is <span class="accented">nard</span>, the Old Arabic <span class="accented">nardu</span>. It was made from an Indian plant, the <span class="accented">Valeriana</span>, called <span class="accented">Nardo-stachys</span> '<span class="accented">Gatamansi</span>, growing in Northern and Eastern India. The hairy part of the stem immediately above the root yields the perfume. That it was "very precious" we see from the account of Mary's offering, which was worth more than three hundred denarii, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> &pound;8 10s. (<a href="../../par/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a>). Horace promised Virgil a whole cask, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nine gallons, of the best wine in exchange for a small onyx box full of the perfume. The metaphor represents the intense longing of love. <span class="accented">Myrrh</span> was an exotic introduced into Palestine from Arabia, Abyssinia, and India. Like frankincense, it is one of the amyridae. The <span class="accented">Balsamodendron myrrha</span> is the tree itself with its leaves and flowers. From the tree came a resin or gum (<span class="accented">Gummi myrrhae</span>), which either dropped from the leaves or was artificially obtained by incisions in the bark. The natural product was the more valuable. It was much prized as a perfume, and employed for many purposes. The Hebrew women were accustomed to carry little bags or bottles of myrrh suspended from their necks and hanging down between the breasts under the dress, diffusing an attractive fragrance round them. The word <span class="accented">tseror</span> is, properly, "a little bag," <span class="accented">sacculus</span>, "that which one ties up," rather than a "bundle." The meaning, of course, is rhetorical - He is at my heart and delightful to all my thoughts as the fragrance to my senses. The henna flowers, or cypress, in the vineyards of Engedi, is a very beautiful figure. <span class="accented">Copher</span>, the cypress cluster, - in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in Arabic, <span class="accented">al-henna</span> (<span class="accented">Lawsonia</span>) - grows in Palestine and Egypt, as we are told by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.' 12:24). It is a tall shrub reaching to eight or ten feet, exceedingly beautiful in appearance, and giving forth a delightful odour. It is named from a root "to be white or yellow-white." The Moslem women stain their hands and feet with it to give them a yellow tint. Engedi was a lovely district  on the west of the Dead Sea - Hazezon Tamar, now <span class="accented">Ain Tidy</span>, where Solomon made terraces on the hillsides and covered them with gardens and vineyards. The allusion confirms the date of the writing as contemporary with Solomon, as the gardens would then be in their perfection. The figure is, perhaps, intended to be an advance in rhetorical force upon that which preceded - the fragrance diffused and almost overpowering, as of a blossoming tree.

She is very sweet and fair to him. The dove is a natural symbol of love; hence it was attached by the classical nations to the garden of love, together with the myrtle, rose, and apple, all of which we find introduced in this Hebrew poem. Hence the Arabic name for a dove, <span class="accented">Jemima</span>, as we see in the Book of Job, was the name of a woman (cf. Columbina). The language of the king is that of ecstasy; hence the interjection and repetition. The enraptured monarch gazes into the eyes of his beloved bride, and sees there only purity, constancy, and affection. In <a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a> the eyes are compared to fish ponds, no doubt for their clear, liquid depth and serenity. Some have thought that the allusion is to the very lovely eyes of the doves; but there is no need of the limitation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/1-16.htm">Song of Solomon 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed <i>is</i> green.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16-ch. 2:1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; also our couch is green. The beams of our house are cedars, and our rafters are firs. I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley.</span> We take these three verses together as being, in all probability, the address of the bride to her royal husband. This was the view taken by the Masoretic editors and preserved in our present pointing of the Hebrew, as we see in the masculine form of the first word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, which replies to the feminine form in ver. 15, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>. The seventeenth verse is apparently abrupt. Why should the bride pass so suddenly from the general address of affection, "Thou art fair, thou art pleasant," to a particular description of a rural scene? The explanation suggested by some of the critics is not farfetched, that Solomon whispers to her that she shall go back with him to her country life if she pleases, or she reminds him of his promise made at some other time. Undoubtedly the point of Shulamith's response lies in ch. 2:1, "I am not at ease in this palatial splendour; I am by nature a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley. Take me to the green couch, and let me lie under the cedars and the firs." The couch is the divan (cf. <a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>), from a root "to cover over" (like "canopy" in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, so called from its protecting the person under it from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or "gnats). It is not that the nuptial bed is particularly intended, or even the bridal bower, but the home itself as a bowery resting place. "Our home is a sweet country home; take me, there, beloved one." The word "green" is very suggestive in the Hebrew. It is said to "combine in itself the ideas of softness and juicy freshness, perhaps of bending and elasticity, of looseness and thus of overhanging ramification, like weeping willow." <span class="accented">Beams</span>, from a root "to meet," "to lay crosswise," "to hold together." But the meaning depends upon the idea of the whole description. Some would render "fretted ceilings," or "galleries;" but Dr. Ginsburg gives it, "our bower is of cedar arches," which excludes the idea of a formal structure made of cedar beams. The same meaning is conveyed in the last clause, "our rafters are firs." The word rendered "rafters" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span>) literally signifies "a place upon which one runs" (like <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, a "street"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a charming or pleasant spot. The <span class="accented">beroth</span> is the cypress tree, an Aramaic word, or one used in the north of Palestine. The meaning is, "our pleasant retreat is cypresses" - is beautiful and fragrant with the cypress tree. Delitzsch, however, and others would take it differently as describing the panels or hollows of a wainscoted ceiling, like <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">lacunae</span>, <span class="accented">lacunaria</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">laquearii</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>). But the concluding words would then be unfitting. The bride is not describing a splendid palace, but a country home. "I am a tender maiden," she says, "who has been brought up in retirement; take me to a forest palace and to the green, fragrant surroundings, where the meadow flower, the valley lily will be happy." We are so accustomed to the rendering of <a href="../../par/songs/2-1.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>, which our Revised Version has adopted from the Authorized, that it would be wrong to destroy the effect which it borrows from long familiarity unless it were absolutely necessary. The word <span class="accented">chavatseleth</span>, however, has been differently translated; it is literally any wild flower - rose, saffron crocus (<span class="accented">Colchieum autumnale</span>), tulip, narcissus, lily. The crocus is, perhaps, nearest . to the meaning, as the name is probably derived from a root "to form bulbs" or bulbous knolls. It occurs only once again, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>, where it is rendered "rose" in the Authorized Version; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">flos</span>. Some derive it from the root <span class="accented">chavaz</span>, "to be bright," with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as termination. <span class="accented">Sharon</span> may be here a general denomination of the open field or plain, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "to be straight, plain." There  was a district called Sharon on the coast from Joppa to Caesarea. There was another Sharon beyond the Jordan (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>). According to Eusebius and Jerome, there was yet another, between Tabor and Tiberias, and this, as being in the north, may be referred to. Aquila renders "a rosebud of Sharon." The lily (<span class="accented">shoshannah</span>) is only found as here in the feminine form in the Apocrypha. The red and white lily were both known. Some would derive the word from the numeral (<span class="accented">shesh</span>) "six," because the liliaceae are six-leaved, while the rosaceae are five-leaved; but it is probably akin to <span class="accented">shesh</span>, "byssus," <span class="accented">shayish</span>, "white marbles" (cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>, "He shall bloom as a lily"). Our Lord's reference to "the lilies of the field" reminds us that they were in Palestine both very beautiful and very abundant. Zockler thinks it is not the strongly scented white lily (<span class="accented">Lilium candidam</span>) to which reference is made, but the red lily (<span class="accented">Lilium rubens</span>); but either will convey the same idea of a flower of the field which is meant. "My beauty is the beauty of nature - artless and pure." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The apple tree is noted for the fragrance of its blossom and the sweetness of its fruit; hence the name <span class="accented">tappuach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">naphach</span>, "to breathe sweetly." The trees of the wood or forest are specially referred to, because they are generally wild, and their fruit sour and rough, and many have no fruit or flower. The Chaldee renders, "citron;" Rosenmuller and others, "quince." The word is rare (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>). It is sometimes the tree itself, at other times the fruit. It occurs in proper names, as (<a href="../../par/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>), "The King of Tappuah," etc., and that shows that it was very early known in Palestine. It occurs frequently in the Talmud. The word is masculine, while "lily" is feminine. "I sat with delight" is expressed in true Hebrew phrase, "I delighted and sat," the intensity of feeling being expressed by the piel of the verb. By the shadow is intended both protection and refreshment; by the fruit, enjoyment. Perhaps we may go further, and say there is here a symbolical representation of the spiritual life, as both that of trust and participation. The greatness and goodness of the tree of life protects and covers the sinner, while the inner nature and Divine virtue of the Saviour comes forth in delicious fruits, in his character, words, ministry, and spiritual gifts. If there is any truth in the typical view, it must be found in such passages as this, where the metaphor is so simple and apt, and has been incorporated with all religious language as the vehicle of faith and love. Hymnology abounds in such ideas and analogies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-4.htm">Song of Solomon 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me <i>was</i> love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to the house of the wine.</span> Not, as some, "the house of the vines" - that is, the vineyard. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">yayin</span> corresponds with the AEthiopic <span class="accented">wain</span>, and has run through the Indo-European languages. The meaning is - To the place where he royally entertains his friends. Hence the reference which immediately follows to the protection with which the king overshadows his beloved. He covers me there with his fear-inspiring, awful banner, love, which, because of its being love, is terrible to all enemies. The word which is used for "banner" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) is from a root "to cover," that which covers the shaft or standard; the <span class="accented">pannus</span>, "the cloth," which is fastened to a shaft (cf. pennon). Her natural fear and bashfulness is overcome by the loving presence of the king, which covers her weakness like a banner. Some versions render it as an imperative. There can be no doubt of the meaning that the banner is the military banner, as the word is always so used (see <a href="../../par/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>). Perhaps there is a reference to the grandeur and military strength in which the young bride felt delight as she looked up at her young husband in his youthful beauty and manly vigour. The typical significance is very easily discovered. It would be straining it too much to see any allusion to the ritual of the Christian sacraments; but whether we think of the individual soul or of the people of God regarded collectively, such delight in the rich provisions of Divine love, and in the tender guardianship of the Saviour over those whom he has called to himself, belong to the simplest facts of believing experience. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I <i>am</i> sick of love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stay me with raisins, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</span> Again the intensive form of the verb is chosen. She is almost sinking; she cries out for comfort. The food for which she longs is the grape cakes - the grapes sufficiently dried to be pressed together as cakes, which is very refreshing and reviving; not raisins as we know them, but with more of the juice of the grape in them. So date cakes are now offered to travellers in the East. "Refresh me; for I am in a state of deep agitation because of the intensity of my love." Ginsburg thinks the cakes are baked by the fire, the word being derived from a root "to burn." The translation, "flagons of wine," in the Authorized Version, follows the rabbinical exposition, but it is quite unsupported by the critics. Love sickness is common in Eastern countries, more so than with us in the colder hemisphere. Perhaps the appeal of the bride is meant to be general, not immediately directed to the king, as if a kind of exclamation, and it may be connected with the previous idea of the banner. The country maiden is dazzled with the splendour and majesty of the king. She gives up, as it were, in willing resignation of herself, the rivalry with one so great and glorious in the expression of love and praise; she sinks back with delight and ecstasy, calling upon any around to support her, and Solomon himself answers the appeal, and puts his loving arm around her and holds up her head, and gives her the sweetest and tenderest embraces, which renew her strength. We know that in the  spiritual life there are such experiences. The intensity of religious feeling is closely connected with physical exhaustion, and when the soul cries for help and longs for comfort, the presence of the Saviour is revealed; the weakness is changed into strength. The apostolic seer in the Apocalypse describes himself as overcome with the glory of the Saviour's appearance, and being brought back to himself by his voice (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).

The hand gently smooths with loving caresses. The historical sense is more in accordance with the context, as the next verse is an appeal to the attendant ladies. Behold my happiness, how my Beloved comforts me! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <i>my</i> love, till he please.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the toes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.</span> The fact that these words occur again in <a href="../../par/songs/3-5.htm">Song of Solomon 3:5</a> and Song 8:4 shows that they are a kind of chorus or refrain. It is also evident that they are in the lips of Shulamith the bride. Some have suggested that they are uttered by some one else, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the queen-mother subsequently referred to, Solomon himself, the heavenly Bridegroom, the shepherd lover from whom Shulamith had been taken. But all these suggestions are unnecessary and unsupported. The natural and simple view is that the same voice is speaking as in ver. 6. But what is the meaning of this adjuration? Is it merely, "I throw myself on the sympathy you have already expressed"? Ewald well remarks, "In common life people swore by things which belonged to the subject of conversation or were especially dear to the speaker. As, therefore, the warrior swears by his sword; as Mohammed by th e soul, of which he is just about to speak (see Koran, ch. 91:7); so here Shulamith by the lovely gazelles, since she is speaking of love." The Israelites were permitted to adjure by that which is not God, but they would only solemnly swear by God himself. Delitzsch thinks this is the only example of direct adjuration in Scripture without the name of God. The meaning has probably been sought too far away. The bride is perfectly happy, but she is conscious that such exquisite happiness may be disturbed, the dream of her delight broken through. She compares herself to a roe or a gazelle, the most timorous and shy of creatures (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a>). The Septuagint has a peculiar rendering; which points to a different reading of the orignial <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "by the power and virtues of the field." Perhaps the meaning is the same - By the purity and blessedness of a simple country life, I adjure you not to interfere with the course of true love. It is much debated whether the meaning is, "Do not excite or stir up love," or, "Do not disturb love in its peaceful de light." It certainly must be maintained that by "love" is meant "the lover." The refer once is to the passion of love itself. A similar expression is used of the feeling of jealousy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>). The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5e8;</span> (piel) is added to strengthen the idea, and is always used in the sense "to excite or awaken," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a> of strife; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> of strength or power. We must not for a moment think of any artificial excitement of love as referred to. The idea is - See what a blessed thing is pure and natural affection: let not love be forced or unnatural. But there are those who dispute this interpretation. They think that the main idea of the whole poem is not the spontaneity of love, but a commendation of pure and chaste conjugal affection, as opposed to the dissoluteness and sensuality fostered by polygamy. They would therefore take the abstract "love" for the concrete "loved one," as in <a href="../../par/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a> The bride would not have the beloved one aroused by the intrusion of others; or the word "love" may be taken to mean "the dream of love." Which ever explanation is chosen, the sense is substantially the same - Let me rejoice in my blessedness. The bride is seen at the close of this first part of the poem in the arms of the bridegroom. She is lost in him, and his happiness is hers. She calls upon the daughters of Jerusalem to rejoice with her. This is, in fact, the keynote of the song. The two main thoughts in the poem are the purity of love and the power of love. The reference to the toes and gazelles of the field is not so much to their shyness and timidity as to their purity, as distinguished from the creatures more close to cities; hence the appeal to the daughters of Jerusalem, who, as being ladies of the metropolis, might not sympathize as they should with the country maiden. The rest of the poem is a remembrance of the part which illustrates and confirms the sentiment of the refrain - Let the pure love seek its own perfection; let its own pleasure be realized. So, spiritually, let grace complete what grace begins. "Blessed are all those who trust in him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-8.htm">Song of Solomon 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8-ch. 3:5.</span> - Part II.

Recollections of the wooing time in the north. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</span> There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this song. The  bride is going back in thought to the scenes of her home life, and the sweet days of first love. "The house stands alone among the rocks and deep in the mountain range; around are the vineyards which the family have planted, and the hill pastures on which they feed their flocks. She longingly looks out for her distant lover." The expression, "The voice of my beloved!" must not be taken to mean that she hears the sound of his feet or voice, but simply as an interjection, like "hark!" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where the voice of the blood crying merely means, "Hark how thy brother's blood cries;" that is, "Believe that it does so cry"). So here, "I seem to hear the voice of my beloved; hark, he is coming!" It is a great delight to the soul to go back in thought over the memories of its first experience of the Saviour's presence. The Church is edified by the records of grace in the histories of Divine dealings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-9.htm">Song of Solomon 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he showeth himself through the lattice.</span> The <span class="accented">tsevi</span> is the gazelle, Arabic <span class="accented">ghazal.</span> Our word is derived through the Spanish or Moorish <span class="accented">gazela</span>. The young hart, or chamois, is probably so called from the covering of young hair (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-5.htm">Proverbs 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>). Shulamith represents herself as within the house, waiting for her friend. Her beloved is standing behind the wall, outside before the house; he is playfully looking through the windows, now through one and now through another, seeking her with peering eyes of love. Both the words employed, convey, the meaning of searching and moving quickly. The <span class="accented">windows</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the openings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a window broken through a wall, or the meaning may be a lattice window, a pierced wooden structure. The word is not the common word for a window, which is <span class="accented">shevaka</span> (now <span class="accented">shabbaka</span>), from a root meaning "to twist," "to make a lattice." Spiritually, we may see an allusion to the glimpses of truth and tastes of the goodness of religion, which precede the real fellowship of the soul with God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-10.htm">Song of Solomon 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span> The word "spake" Conveys the meaning in answer to a person appearing, but not necessarily in answer to a voice heard. We most suppose that Shulamith recognized her beloved, and made some sign that she was near, or looked forth from the window. As the soul responds, it is more and more invited; the voice of the Bridegroom is heard calling the object of his love by name, "I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over <i>and</i> gone;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, lo, the winter is the rain is over</span> <span class="accented">and <span class="cmt_word"></span>gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing</span> <span class="accented">of birds <span class="cmt_word"></span>is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree ripeneth her green figs, and the vines are in blossom, they give forth their fragrance.

The Jews in Jerusalem to this day call rain <span class="accented">shataa.</span> The rain; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the showers. The flowers, or the flowery time, corresponding with the singing time. Several versions, as the LXX. and other Greek, Jerome in the Latin, and the Targum and Venetian, render, "the time of pruning," taking the <span class="accented">zamir</span> from a root <span class="accented">zamar</span>, "to prune the vine." It is, however, regarded by most critics as an onomatopoetic word meaning "song," "music," like <span class="accented">zimrah</span>, "singing." The reference to the voice of the turtledove, the cooing note which is so sweet and attractive among the woods, shows that the time of spring is intended. Ginsburg says wherever <span class="accented">zamir</span> occurs, either in the singular or plural, it means "singing" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>). The form of the word conveys the idea of the time of the action, as we see in the words for "harvest" (<span class="accented">asiph</span>) and "ploughing time" (<span class="accented">charish</span>). The fig tree and the vine were both employed as symbols of prosperity and peace, as the fig and grape were so much used as food (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>). The little fruits of the fig tree begin, when the spring commences, to change colour from green to red (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/11-13.htm">Mark 11:13</a>, where the Passover time is referred to). The word "to ripen" is literally, "to grow red or sweet." The blossoming vines give forth a very delicate and attractive fragrance. The description is acknowledged by all to be very beautiful. The invitation is to fellowship in the midst of the pure loveliness of nature, when all was adapted to meet and sustain the feelings of awakened love. The emotions of the soul are blended easily with the sensations derived from the outward world. When we carefully avoid extravagance, and put the soul first and not second, then the delights of the senses may help the heart to realize the deepest experience of Divine communion. But the bridegroom first solicits the bride. We reverse the true spiritual order when we place too much dependence on the influence of external objects or sensuous pleasures. Art may assist religion to its expression, but it must never be made so prominent that the artistic pleasure swallows up the religious emotion. Love of nature is not love of Christ. Love of music is not love of Christ. Yet the soul that seeks him may rejoice in art and music, because they blend their attractions with its devotion, and help it to be a joy and a passion.

The bridegroom is still addressing his beloved one, who has not yet come forth from the house in the rocks, though she has shown herself at the window. The language is highly poetical, and may be compared with similar words in Homer and Virgil (cf. 'Iliad.' 21:493; 'Aeneid.' 5:213, etc.). The Lord loveth the sight of his people. He delightcth in their songs and in their prayers. He is in the midst of their assemblies. Secret religion is not the highest religion. The highest emotions of the soul do not decrease in their power as they are expressed. They become more and more a ruling principle of life. There are many who need this encouragement to come forth out of secrecy, out of solitude, out of their own private home and individual thoughts, and realize the blessing of fellowship with the Lord and with his people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines <i>have</i> tender grapes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.</span> There is some difficulty in deciding to which of the persons this speech is to be attributed. It is most naturally, however, assigned to the bride, and this is the view of the majority of critics. Hence she refers to the vineyards as "our vineyards," which the bridegroom could scarcely say. On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that the words are abrupt regarded as a response to the beautiful appeal of the lover. The following are the remarks of Delitzsch on the subject: "This is a vine dresser's ditty, in accord with Shulamith's experience as the keeper of a vineyard, which, in a figure, aims at her love relation. The vineyards, beautiful with fragrant blossoms, point to her covenant of love, and the foxes, the little foxes, which might destroy those united vineyards, point to all the great and little enemies and adverse circumstances which threaten to gnaw and destroy love in the blossom ere it has reached the ripeness of full enjoyment." Some think that Shulamith is giving the reason why she cannot immediately join her beloved, referring to the duties enjoined upon her by her brethren. But there is an awkwardness in this explanation. The simplest and most straightforward is that which connects the words immediately with the invitation of the lover to come forth into the lovely vineyards. Is it not an allusion to the playful pleasure which the young people would find among the vineyards in chasing the little foxes? and may not the lover take up some well known country ditty, and sing it outside the window as a playful repetition of the invitation to appear? The words do seem to be arranged in somewhat of a lyrical form - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Catch us the foxes,<br />Foxes the little ones,<br />Wasting our vineyards,<br />When our vineyards are blossoming."</span> The foxes (<span class="accented">shualim</span>), or little jackals, were very numerous in Palestine (see <a href="../../par/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>). The little jackals were seldom more than fifteen inches high. There would be nothing unsuitable in the address to a maiden to help to catch such small animals. The idea of the song is - Let us all join in taking them. Some think that Shulamith is inviting the king to call his attendants to the work. But when two lovers thus approach one another, it is not likely that others would be thought cf. However the words be viewed, the typical meaning can scarcely be missed. The idea of clearing the vineyards of depredators well suits the general import of the poem. Let the blossoming love of the soul be without injury and restraint. Let the rising faith and affection be carefully guarded. Both individuals and communities do well to think of the little foxes that spoil the vines. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">My beloved <i>is</i> mine, and I <i>am</i> his: he feedeth among the lilies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feedeth</span> (<span class="cmt_word">his flock</span>) <span class="cmt_word">among the lilies.</span> These are the words of the bride. The latter clause is repeated in <a href="../../par/songs/6-2.htm">Song of Solomon 6:2</a>, with the addition, "in the gardens," and it is evident that Solomon is lovingly regarded as a shepherd, because Shulamith delights to think of him as fully sympathizing with her simple country life. She idealizes. The words may be taken as either the response given at the time by the maiden to the invitation of her lover to come forth into the vineyards, or as the breathing of love as she lies in the arms of Solomon. Lilies are the emblem of purity, lofty elevation above that which is common. Moreover, the lily stalk is the symbol of the life of regeneration among the mystical mediaevalists. Mary the Virgin, the <span class="accented">Rosa mystica</span>, in ancient paintings is represented with a lily in her hand at the Annunciation. The people of God were called by the Jewish priests "a people of lilies." So Mary was the lily of lilies in the lily community; the <span class="accented">sanctissima</span> in the <span class="accented">communio sanctorum.</span> There may be an allusion to the lily forms around Solomon in his palace - the daughters of Jerusalem; in that ease the words must be taken as spoken, not in remembrance of the first love, but in present joy in Solomon's embrace. Some would render the words as simply praise of Solomon himself, "who, wherever  he abides, spreads radiancy and loveliness about him," or "in whose footsteps roses and lilies ever bloom." At least, they are expressive of entire self-surrender and delight. She herself is a lily, and the beloved one feeds upon her beauty, purity, and perfection. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/2-17.htm">Song of Solomon 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</span> This is generally supposed to be the voice of the maiden addressing her suitor, and bidding him return in the evening, when the day cools, and when the lengthening shadows fall into night. Some have seen in such words a clear indication of a clandestine interview, and would find in them a confirmation of their hypothesis that the poem is founded on a romantic story of Solomon's attempt to draw a shepherdess from her shepherd. But there is no necessity to disturb the flow of the bride's loving recollections by such a fancy. She is recalling the visit of her lover. How, at first, she declined his invitation to go forth with him to the vineyards, but with professions of love appealed to him to return to the mountains, and in the evening come once more and rejoice in her love. But the words may be rendered, "during the whole day, and until the evening comes, turn thyself to me," which is the view taken by some critics. The language may be general; that is, "Turn, and I will follow." "The mountains of Bether" are the rugged mountains; <span class="accented">Bether</span>, from a root "to divide," "to cut," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> divided by ravines; or the word may be the abstract for the concrete - "the mountains of separation" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mountains which separate. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "decussated mountains." The Syriac and Theodotion take the word as for <span class="accented">beshamim, i.e.</span> offerings of incense (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). There is no such geographical name known, though there is Bithron, east of Jordan, near Mahauaim (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>). The Chaldee, Ibn-Ezra, Rashi, and many others render it "separation" (cf. Luther's <span class="accented">scheideberge</span>). Bochart says, "Montes scissionis ita dicti propter <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> et <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>." The meaning has been thus set forth: "The request of Shulamith that he should return to the mountains breathes self-denying humility, patient modesty, inward joy in the joy of her beloved. She will not claim him for herself till he have accomplished his work. But when he associates with her in the evening, as with the Emmaus disciples, she will rejoice if he becomes her guide through the newborn world of spring. Perhaps we may say the Parousia ot the Lord is here referred to in the evening of the world" (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>.). On the whole, it seems most in harmony with the context to take the words as preparing us for what follows - the account of the maiden's distress when she woke up and found not her beloved. We must not expect to be able to explain the language as though it were a clear historical composition, relating facts and incidents. The real line of thought is the underlying connection of spiritual meaning. There is a separation of the lovers. The soul wakes up to feel that its object of delight is gone. Then it complains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/songs/3.htm"><title>Song of Solomon 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/songs/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/songs/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/songs/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/2.htm" title="Song of Solomon 2">&#9668;</a> Song of Solomon 3 <a href="../songs/4.htm" title="Song of Solomon 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-1.htm">Song of Solomon 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span> The bride is probably relating a dream. The time referred to is the close of the day on which she had been visited by her lover. She is retired to rest, and dreams that she searches for the beloved object in the neighbouring city (cf. <a href="../../par/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>). It is another way of telling her love. She is always longing for the beloved one. She had been waiting for him, and he came not, and retired to rest with a heart troubled and anxious because her lover did not appear as she expected at the evening hour. The meaning may be "night after night (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>)" (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/3-8.htm">Song of Solomon 3:8</a>), or the plural maybe used poetically for the singular. Ginsburg observes that "by night on my bed" is opposed to midday couch (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>), merely to express what came into her thoughts at night in her dreams or as the result of a dream. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the bride intends to represent herself as suffering from self-reproach in having grieved her lover and kept him away from her. In that case the typical meaning would be simple and direct. The soul grieves when it is conscious of estrangement from him whom it loves, and the sense of separation becomes intolerable, impelling to new efforts to deepen the spiritual life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-2.htm">Song of Solomon 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">(I said) I will rise now, and go about the city, in the streets and in the broad ways; I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span> Delitzsch renders, "So I will arise, then." The words of the maiden are quite inconsistent with the hypothesis of a shepherd lover, for in that case she would seek him, not in the streets, but outside the city. Some think the city referred to is Jerusalem, with its markets and streets - the royal city (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>). If it is a dream, it will be unnecessary to decide to what city the words refer. The idea of the speaker would seem to be either that she was at the time within the walls of the city referred to, or that she was in some dwelling near. But a dream is not always consistent with the real circumstances of the dreamer. Taking it as a reminiscence of first love, it seems better to understand the city as only imaginary, or some neighbouring town in the north. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-3.htm">Song of Solomon 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">The watchmen that go about the city found me: <i>to whom I said</i>, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen that go about the city found me:</span> (to whom I said) <span class="cmt_word">Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span> The simplicity of these words is very striking. They confirm the view that the bride is recalling what occurred in her country life. The watchmen make no reply, and do not treat her ill, as in the dream related in <a href="../../par/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>, where they are keepers of the walls, and smite her and wound her. In a small country town she might have been recognized, or known to be really in trouble. But such incidents must not be pressed too much in a poem. The allegorical view finds considerable support in the fact that it is difficult on any hypothesis exactly to explain the language as descriptive of real occurrences. In such instances as <a href="../../par/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a> the reference to watchmen in  the city shows that such a metaphor would be familiarly understood. Whether adopted from Solomon's Song or not, the figure of a city watched and guarded, and the people of God as watching for the glory of Zion, was common in the prophetic writings. The soul seeking for its object and for the restoration of its peace calls in the aid of the faithful guardians of the holy city, the friends alike of the Saviour and of those who desire to be his. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-4.htm">Song of Solomon 3:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It was</i> but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was but a little that I passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</span> This verse plainly points to the search referred to in the previous verse being limited to the neighbourhood of Shulamith's home. The lover was not far off, though he had delayed his coming. Possibly it is a real occurrence which is related. In that case we must suppose that the night was not very far advanced. But the hypothesis of a dream is the most natural explanation. The word <span class="accented">cherer</span>, which is used of the house, denotes the inner part, <span class="accented">penetralia.</span> The modesty of the last clause is very beautiful. The mother would, of course, at that time be in her sleeping chamber. There alone would the maiden receive her lover at such a time. The mother would gladly welcome the young man, and thus the love which Shulamith declares is set upon the ground of perfect chastity and homely purity. The object of this little episode introduced by the bride into her song as she lies in the arms of Solomon is to show that, ecstatic and intense as her devotion is, it is not the lawless affection of a concubine, but the love of a noble wife. The religious emotions are always presented to us in Scripture, not as wild fanaticism or superficial excitement, but as pure offering of the heart which blends with the highest relations and interests of human life, and sanctifies home and country with all their ties and obligations. The mother and the child are one in the new atmosphere of bridal joy. No religion is worthy of the name which does not bring its object into the chamber of her who conceived us. We love all that are bound with us in life not the less, but the more, because we love Christ supremely. We revere all that is just and holy in the common world the more, and not the less, because we worship God and serve the Lord. What a rebuke to asceticism, monasticism, and all unsocial religion! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-5.htm">Song of Solomon 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <i>my</i> love, till he please.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.</span> This is the refrain which divides the poem. We thus perceive that the whole of the preceding passage has been uttered by the bride in the presence of the ladies. There is no occasion to connect a refrain very closely with the words which go before it. Like the ancient Greek chorus, it may express a general sentiment in harmony with the pervading feeling of the whole composition. In this case it seems to be a general note of praise, celebrating the preciousness of pure, spontaneous affection. There have been several beautiful and celebrated imitations of this first part of Solomon's Song, though they all fall far short of the original. Paul Gerhard has caught its spirit; Laurentius has copied it in his Advent Hymn. Watts, in bk. 1:66-78 of his 'Divine gongs;' 'Lyra Germanica;' Schaff's 'Christian Song;' and Miss Havergal, in some of her compositions, will furnish examples. Delitzsch quotes an ancient Latin imitation - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quando tandem venies, meus amor?<br />Propera de Libano, dulcis amor!<br />Clamat, amat, sponsula. Veni, Jesu;<br />Dulcis veni Jesu."</span> This ends Part II., which sets before us the lovely beginning of this ideal love. We must then suppose that the writer imagines himself in Jerusalem, as though one of the court ladies, at the time that Solomon the king returns from the north, bringing with him his bride elect. We pass, therefore, from the banqueting chamber, and recall the scenes which accompanied the arrival of Shulamith at Jerusalem. The remainder of the poem is simply the celebration of married love, the delight of the bridegroom in the bride and of the bride in her husband. The whole book concerns a bride, and not one who is about to be made a bride. Here the dream which is introduced is not the dream of a lover awaiting the beloved one, but the dream of a young wife whose bridegroom tarries. The third part is the nuptial rejoicings; the fourth part is the reminiscence of love days or of the early married life; and the fifth part, which is a conclusion, is a visit of Solomon and his bride to the country home of the latter, pointing to the depth and reality of the influence which this pure maiden had upon his royal nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Who <i>is</i> this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6-ch. 5:1.</span> - Part III. NUPTIAL REJOICINGS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the powders of the merchant?</span> This may be taken as spoken by a single voice, one of  the ladies or inhabitants of Jerusalem, or it may be regarded as the exclamation of the whole population going out to see the splendid sight - a gorgeous procession coming towards the city. "Who is this coming?" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, feminine); that is, "Who is this lady coming?" There could be no difficulty in discerning that it was a bridal procession which is seen. Curiosity always asks, "What bride is this?" "Who is <span class="accented">she?"</span> not, "Who is he?" A maiden from Galilee is being conducted to Jerusalem; the procession naturally passes through the valley of the Jordan (Ghor). There is splendour and majesty in the sight. It must be some one coming to the royal palace. The censers of frankincense are being swung to and fro and filling the air with fragrant smoke. Columns of dust and smoke from the burning incense rise up to heaven, and mark the line of progress before and after. "The spices of Arabia" were famous at all times. Hence the names of the perfumes are Arabic, as <span class="accented">murr, levona</span>, and the travelling spice merchant, or trader, was Arabic (cf. the Arabic elixir). We can scarcely miss the typical colouring in such a representation - the <span class="accented">wilderness</span>, typical of bondage and humiliation, sin and misery, out of which the bride is brought; the onward progress towards a glorious destination (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1</a>:16; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>). The Church must pass through the wilderness to her royal home, and the soul must be led out of the wilderness of sin and unbelief into everlasting union with her Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-7.htm">Song of Solomon 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Behold his bed, which <i>is</i> Solomon's; threescore valiant men <i>are</i> about it, of the valiant of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; three score mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel</span>. The litter, or palanquin, is easily recognized. The word is <span class="accented">mittah</span>, which is literally "bed," or "litter," but in the ninth verse we have another word, <span class="accented">appiryon</span>, which is a more stately word. "the royal car." It is the bringing home of the bride which is described. In the forty-fifth psalm the idea seems to be that the bridegroom betook himself to the house of the parents and fetched his bride, or that she was brought to him in festal procession, and he went forth to meet her (see 1 Macc. 9:39). That was the prevailing custom, as we see in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). In this case, however, there is a vast difference in rank between the bride and bridegroom, and she is brought to him. The long journey through the wilderness is implied in the mention of the bodyguard (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). The intention evidently is to show how dear the bride was to Solomon. His mighty men were chosen to defend her. So the Church is surrounded with armies of guardian attendants. Her Lord is the Lord of hosts. The description reminds us of the exquisite lines in Shakespeare's 'Antony and Cleopatra,' in which he describes the lovely Egyptian in her barge "like a burnished throne," lying "in her pavilion (cloth of gold, of tissue)," with the smiling cupids on each side, while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... from the barge,<br />A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br />Of the adjacent wharfs."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc"><a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, sc. 2</span>) The word <span class="accented">mittah</span>, "a bed, or litter," comes from a root "to stretch out," and is also used of a bier (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-21.htm">2 Samuel 3:21</a>). The idea is that of a portable bed, or sitting cushion, hung round with curtains, after the manner of the Indian palanquin, such as is still found in the Turkish caiques or the Venetian gondolas. It was, of course, royal, belonging to Solomon, not to any nobleman or private person; hence its magnificence. The bearers are not named. The bodyguard, consisting of sixty chosen men, forming an escort, were one tenth part of the whole royal guard, as we see from <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>. Delitzsch suggests that in the mention of the number there may be a reference to the twelve tribes of Israel - 60 being a multiple of 12. The term, "mighty men," is explained in the next verse as warriors, that is, men "held fast by the sword" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew idiom, men practised in the use of the sword; so it is explained by some; but others take it as meaning that they "handle the sword;" hence our Revised Version. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-8.htm">Song of Solomon 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">They all hold swords, <i>being</i> expert in war: every man <i>hath</i> his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.</span> The guard of warriors round the litter secured the bride from any sudden alarm as she travelled through the wilderness, and so gave her quiet rest. The journey from Shunem to Jerusalem would be about fifty miles in a direct course, and it was therefore necessary to pass at least one, if not two, nights on the way; the course being through a wild and solitary region. The Church of God may be often called to pass through dangers and enemies, but he that loveth her will provide against her destruction - she shall have rest in the love cf. her Lord. He will surround her with his strength. "My peace I give unto thee" - provided by me, coming from myself, the fruit of my self-sacrificing love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/3-9.htm">Song of Solomon 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seats of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.</span> The palanquin is described, that the attention may be kept fixed awhile on the bridal procession, which, of course, forms the kernel of the whole poem, as representing the perfect union of  the bride and bridegroom. The Greek versions translate <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ferculum.</span> We read in Athenaeus (5:13) that the philosopher and tyrant Athemon showed himself on "a silver-legged <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> with purple coverlet." There probably is some connection between the Hebrew <span class="accented">appiryon</span> and the Greek <span class="accented">phoreion</span>, but it is exceedingly doubtful if the Hebrew is merely a lengthened form of the Greek. Delitzsch derives the Hebrew from a root <span class="accented">parah</span>, "to cut or carve" anything of wood. The Greek would seem to be connected with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, "to bear," "carry." The resemblance may be a mere coincidence. The rabbinical tradition is that the Hebrew word means "couch, or litter." Hitzig connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">paryana</span>, meaning "saddle," "riding saddle," with which we may compare the Indian <span class="accented">paryang.</span> "bed." Others find a Chaldee root for the word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "to run," as <span class="accented">currus</span> in Latin, or from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shine," <span class="accented">i.e."</span> to be adorned." At all events, it would not be safe to argue the late date of the book from such a word as <span class="accented">appiryon</span>, on account of its resemblance to a Greek word. The "wood of Lebanon" is, of course, the cedar or cypress (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>, etc.). There may be a covert allusion intended to the decoration of the temple as the place where the honour of the Lord dwelleth, and where he meets his people. The frame of the palanquin was of wood, the ornaments of silver. The references to the high value set upon silver, while gold is spoken of as though it was abundant, are indications of the age in which the poem was composed, which must have been nearly contemporaneous with the Homeric poems, in which gold is spoken of similarly. Recent discoveries of the tomb of Agamemnon, etc., confirm the literary argument. The palanquins of India are also highly decorated. The daughters of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ladies of the court, in their affection for King Solomon, have procured a costly tapestry, or several such, which they have spread over the purple cushion. Thus it is paved, or covered over, with the tokens of love - while all love is but a preparation for this supreme love. (For the purple coverings of the seat, see <a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>.) The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the last clause is rendered differently by some, but there can be no doubt that the meaning is "on the part of," that is, coming from. The typical interpreter certainly finds a firm ground here. Whether we think of the individual believer or of the Church of God, the metaphor is very apt and beautiful - we are borne along towards the perfection of our peace and blessedness in a chariot of love. All that surrounds us speaks to us of the Saviour's love and of his royal magnificence, as he is adored by all the pure and lovely spirits in whose companionship he delights.

This seems to be an appeal to a larger company of those who will rejoice in the bride and her happiness. The daughters of Zion are perhaps intended to represent the people generally as distinguished from the ladies of the court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let all the people rejoice in their king and in his royal bride. The mention of the royal mother seems to point to the beginning of Solomon's reign as the time referred to. The crown, or chaplet, with which the proud mother adorned her son, was the fresh wreath round a young king's head, a wedding coronet, no doubt made of gold and silver. It was not the crown placed on the head of Pharaoh's daughter, which would not be so spoken cf. According to the Talmud, the custom remained even to later times. There can be no doubt of Bathsheba's special delight in Solomon (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13</a>). We must not, of course, push too far the typical interpretation of such language, which may be taken as the poetical form rather than the spiritual substance. And yet there may be an allusion, in the joy and pride of Bathsheba in her son's gladness, and the consummation of his nuptial bliss, to the Incarnation and the crowning glory of a Divine humanity, which is at once the essential fact of redemption, and the bright expectation which, on the head of the Saviour, lights up eternity to the faith of his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/songs/4.htm"><title>Song of Solomon 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/songs/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/songs/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/songs/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/3.htm" title="Song of Solomon 3">&#9668;</a> Song of Solomon 4 <a href="../songs/5.htm" title="Song of Solomon 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-1.htm">Song of Solomon 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair, my love; behold, thou <i>art</i> fair; thou <i>hast</i> doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair <i>is</i> as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thine hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Mount Gilead.</span> We commence, at this verse, the loving converse of the bridegroom with the bride, which we must suppose is heard as they travel together in the bridal procession. The words of adoring affection are chiefly spoken by the bridegroom, as is natural in the circumstances, and the reference to the journey, and its consummation in ver. 8, make it certain that the intention is to carry us in thought to the palanquin and the breathings of first love in bridal joy. The poetry is exquisite and truly Eastern, while yet absolutely chaste and pure. The praise of the eyes is common in all erotic poetry. Her eyes gleam, in colour, motion, and lustre, like a pair of doves from behind the veil; showing that the bride is thought of as travelling. The bride was always deeply veiled (see <a href="../../par/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>), as the Roman bride wore the <span class="accented">velum flamineum</span>. The LXX. have mistaken the meaning, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>. The veil might typify silence or reserve, but the word is <span class="accented">tsammah</span>, which is from a root "to veil," and is righty rendered by Symmachus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The hair was long and dark, and lay down the shoulders uncovered and free, which added much to the graceful attraction of the bride. In later times it was customary for the hair to be adorned with a wreath of myrtle or roses, or a golden ornament representing Jerusalem. The goats in Syria and the neighbouring countries are mostly black or dark brown, while the sheep are white. Delitzsch says, "A flock of goats encamped upon a mountain (rising up, to one looking from a distance, as in a steep slope and almost perpendicularly), and as if hanging down lengthwise on its sides, presents a lovely view adorning the landscape." It would be especially lovely amid the romantic scenery of Gilead. The, verb rendered "lie along" is otherwise taken by the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate <span class="accented">ascenderunt.</span> The rabbis differ from one another in their renderings. One says, "which, look, down;" another, "make bare," "quit," or "descend;" another, "are seen." The modern translators vary. Luther says, "shorn;" Houbigant, "hang down;" Kleuken and Ewald, "shows itself;" Gesenius and others, "lie down;" Ginsburg, "rolling down," "running down." Our Revised Version gives, <span class="accented">lie along</span>, which is a very probable meaning. The reference is to the luxuriance and rich colour of the hair. Gilead would be a recollection of the bride's native place. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-2.htm">Song of Solomon 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thy teeth <i>are</i> like a flock <i>of sheep that are even</i> shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none <i>is</i> barren among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them.</span> The  simile is very apt and beautiful Thy teeth are perfectly smooth, regular, and white; the upper set corresponding exactly to the lower set, like twin births in which there is no break (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/6-6.htm">Song of Solomon 6:6</a>). The moisture of the <span class="accented">saliva dentium</span>, heightening the glance of the teeth, is frequently mentioned in love songs. The whiteness of wool is often used as a comparison (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; Book of Enoch 46:1). Some think that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. should not be rendered "newly shorn," but "periodically shorn" (see Ginsburg) - a poetical epithet for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The newly shorn would be washed first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, "to be double,....to be pairs," in the hiph. is "to make double," "to make pairs," "to appear paired." Perhaps the reference is to the sheep being washed in pairs, and going up side by side from the water. This would seem almost more exact than the idea of twin lambs, because the difference in size between the ewe and the lamb would suggest irregularity. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, "deprived," "bereaved" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>), may point merely to the loneliness of the single sheep going up by itself, suggesting one tooth without its fellow. Ginsburg says, "all of which are paired." Each keeps to its mate as they come up from the pool. This is a decided improvement on the Authorized Version. But the figure is clear with either rendering, and is very striking and suggestive of the pleasant country life to which the bride was accustomed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-3.htm">Song of Solomon 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thy lips <i>are</i> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech <i>is</i> comely: thy temples <i>are</i> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely; thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> <span class="accented">Scarlet</span>; that is, shining, glistening red colour. <span class="accented">Thy mouth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span>). Thy mouth as speaking. So the LXX., Jerome, and Venetian, "thy speech," <span class="accented">eloquium</span>, conversation. But this is questioned, as it should then be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span>. The word <span class="accented">midhbar</span> undoubtedly means "the mouth," from <span class="accented">davar</span>, "to speak," with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> preformative, as the name of the instrument. It is the preterite for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, but perhaps as referring specially to speech. <span class="accented">Thy temples</span>; Latin <span class="accented">tempora</span>, from the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, "weak," meaning the thin, piece of skull on each side of the eyes, like the German <span class="accented">schlafe</span>, from <span class="accented">schlaff</span>, "slack." The inside of the pomegranate is of a red colour mixed and tempered with the ruby colour. Ginsburg, however, thinks that the cheeks are intended, and that the comparison is with the outside of the pomegranate, in which the vermilion colour is mingled with brown, and resembles the round cheek; but then why say, "<span class="accented">piece</span> of a pomegranate"? <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, from the root "to cut fruit" (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4.htm">1 Kings 4</a>:39), certainly must refer to the cut fruit and the appearance of the inside. The meaning may be a segment, that is, so as to represent the roundness of the cheek. Possibly the reference may be to blushes on the bride's cheek, or to ornaments which appeared through the veil. We can scarcely expect to make out every particular in an Eastern description. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thy neck <i>is</i> like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.</span> There is an evident change here in the character of the similitudes. The royal bridegroom does not forget to praise the majesty of his bride. The description now suits a royal queen. She is full of dignity and grace in her bearing. The tower referred to was no doubt that which was sometimes called "The tower of the flock" (<a href="../../par/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>), that from which David surveyed the flock of his people (cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16, 25</a>) - the government building erected on Mount Zion which served as a court of justice. The word <span class="accented">talpiyoth</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;</span>, as if a proper name. Hengstenberg would render it "built for hanging swords," supposing it composed of two words - <span class="accented">tal</span>, from a root "to hang," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>, "swords." But the word <span class="accented">piyoth</span> does not mean "swords," but the "double edges" of the swords. Kimchi renders. "an erection of sharp-cornered stones." Gesenius takes it from two roots, "to perish" and "to go," that is, <span class="accented">exitialibus armis</span>, which is very doubtful. Ewald's explanation seems the best, "built for close troops, so that many hundreds or thousands find room therein," taking it from a root, connected with the Arabic, meaning, "to wrap together." Delitzsch, however, observes that both in Aramaic and Talmudic Hebrew words occur, like this, in the sense of "enclosure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> joining together, one working into the other, so that it may be taken as meaning, "in ranks together." This view is supported by Doderlein, Meier, Aquila, Jerome, Vulgate (<span class="accented">propugnacula</span>), and Venetian (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). If this be accepted, it may mean "terraced," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> built in stories one above another. This would convey the appearance of the tall, straight neck better than any. Surrounded with ornaments, the neck would so appear. There is another suggestion, supported by Ginsburg and taken from Rashi and Rashbun, Jewish writers, that the word is a contraction for a noun meaning "instruction," and means "the model tower" - the tower built for an architect's model. It would be rendered, "built for the builder's model." The meaning "armoury" takes it as composed of two words, <span class="accented">tael</span>," a hill," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>," swords." It was decorated with a thousand shields, which was a customary adornment of towers and castles (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>). <span class="accented">All the</span>  <span class="accented">shields of heroes.</span> We can scarcely doubt the reference in such words to the time of Solomon, and therefore to his authorship, as the allusion to heroes, or mighty men of valour, would be customary soon after the time of David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-5.htm">Song of Solomon 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thy two breasts <i>are</i> like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.</span> This is a beautiful and yet perfectly delicate figure, describing the lovely equality and perfect shape and sweet freshness of the maiden's bosom. The meadow covered with lilies suggests beauty and fragrance. Thus the loveliness of the bride is set forth in seven comparisons, her perfections being sevenfold. "A twin pair of the young of the gazelle, lying in a bed covered with lilies, representing the fragrant delicacy and elegance of a chaste virgin besom, veiled by the folds of a dress redolent of sweet odour" (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/1-13.htm">Song of Solomon 1:13</a>). The bridegroom, having thus delighted himself in praise of his bride's loveliness, then proceeds to declare his desire for her sweet society, but he is interrupted by the bride. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-6.htm">Song of Solomon 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</span> If this be the language of the bride, which most modern interpreters think, the meaning is to check the ardour of her lover, in the modesty of her fresh and maidenly feeling - Let me retire from such praises. They are too ardent for me. It is only a moment's interruption, which is followed by still more loving words from the bridegroom. We must naturally connect the words with <a href="../../par/songs/2-17.htm">Song of Solomon 2:17</a>, where the bride certainly speaks. Louis de Leon thinks that the meaning is general, "shady and fragrant places." Anton (1773) suggests that she is desiring to escape and be free. It cannot be included as a description of the neighbourhood of the royal palace. She might, however, mean merely - Let me walk alone in the lovely gardens of the palace until the shades of night shall hide my blushes. It is unlikely that the words are in the mouth of Solomon; for then it would be impossible to explain their use by Shulamith previously. She is not referring to Lebanon and its neighbourhoed, and there can be no idea of looking back to a lover from whom she is torn. The interpretation which connects it with maidenly feeling is certainly the most in harmony with what has preceded. Perhaps the typical meaning is underlying the words - Let me find a place of devout meditation to feed my thoughts on the sweetness of this Divine love into which I have entered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-7.htm">Song of Solomon 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou <i>art</i> all fair, my love; <i>there is</i> no spot in thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee.</span> The bridegroom speaks. The sweet humility and modesty of the bride kindles his love afresh. He praised the loveliness of her bodily form, and she by her response showed the exceeding loveliness of her soul. It must not be forgotten that, whether borrowed from this book or not, such language is undoubtedly employed in Scripture of the Church, the bride, the Lamb's wife, who is described as "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). It should be noticed that the king immediately addresses his love as "bride," and "sister-bride," to show that there is more than admiration of her person in his thoughts. She is his by assimilation and by eternal union, and he invites her to enter fully into the new life which he has prepared for her, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>, "forgetting her own people, and her father's house." It is not enough that feeling should be stirred, or even that it should take possession of the soul, if it be only feeling; it is required of us that our inner life of emotion should become practical devotedness, "counting all things but loss" for the sake of him we love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">Come with me from Lebanon, <i>my</i> spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</span> This seems to be simply the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, the meaning being, "Give thyself up to me" - thou art mine; look away from the past, and delight thyself in the future. Delitzsch, however, thinks that the bridegroom seeks the bride to go with him up the steep heights of Lebanon, and to descend with him from thence; for while ascending the mountain one has no view before him, but when descending he has the whole panorama of the surrounding region lying at his feet. It is stretching poetical language too far to take it so literally and topically; there is no necessity to think of either the lover or his beloved as actually on the mountains, the idea is simply that of the mountainous region - Turn thy back upon it, look away from it. This is clearly seen from the fact that the names connected with Lebanon - Amana, Senir, Hermon - could have no reference to the bride's being in them. as they represent Anti-Libanus, separated from Lebanon by the Coelo-Syrian valley, stretching from the Banias northwards to the plain of Hamath (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a>, where Amana is Abana, overlooking Damascus, now the Basadia). Shenir, or Senir, and Hermon are neighbouring peaks or mountains, or possibly different names for the same (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> they are mentioned as districts. Hermon is the chief mountain of the range of Anti-Libanus on the northeast border of Palestine (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12</a>). The wild beasts  abounded in that district, especially lions and panthers. They were found in the clefts and defiles of the rocks. Lions, however, have now altogether disappeared. In the name <span class="accented">Amana</span> some think there is an allusion to truth (<span class="accented">amen</span>) (see <a href="../../par/hosea/2-22.htm">Hosea 2:22</a>); but that would be too obscure. The general intention of the passage is simple and plain - Leave the rough places, and come to my palace. The words "with me" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) are taken by the LXX. and Vulgate as though written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the imperative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to come," as a word of invitation, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "thou shalt come," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou hast come and be content, renders it improbable that such should be the reading, whereas the preposition with the pronoun is quite in place. The spiritual meaning is not far to seek. The life that we live without Christ is at best a life among the wild, untamed impulses of nature, and in the rough and dangerous places of the world. He invites us to go with him to the place which he has prepared for us. And so the Church will leave its crude thoughts and undeveloped life, and seek, in the love of Christ and in the gifts of his Spirit, a truer reflection of his nature and will (see <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-16</a>). The Apocalypse is based upon the same idea, the advancement of the kingdom of Christ from the place of lions and panthers to the new Jerusalem, with its perfection of beauty and its eternal peace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</span> The bridegroom still continues his address of love, which we must not, of course, press too closely, though it is noticeable that the language becomes somewhat more sober in tone, as though the writer were conscious of the higher application to which it would be put. Some translators take the first clause as though the word "ravished" should be rendered "emboldened." Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, literally, "heartened," may mean, as in Aramaic, "make courageous." Love in the beginning overpowers, <span class="accented">unhearts</span>, but the general idea must be that of "smitten" or "captured." So the LXX., Venetian, and Jerome, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vulnerasti cor meum</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>). <span class="accented">My sister, my bride</span>, is, of course, the same as "my sisterly bride," a step beyond "my betrothed." Gesenius thinks that "one of thine eyes" should be "one look of thine;" but may it not refer to the eye appearing through the veil, as again one chain of the neck may glitter and attract all the more that the whole ornamentation did not appear in view? If but a portion of her beauty so overpowers, what will be the effect of the whole blaze of her perfection? As the Church advances in her likeness to her Lord, she becomes more and more the object of his delight, and as the soul receives more and more grace, so is her fellowship with Christ more and more assured and joyful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-10.htm">Song of Solomon 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">How fair is thy love, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices! Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</span> The expression of thy love, that is, the endearments, the embraces, are delightful. The allusion to the lips may be a mere amplification of the word "love," but it may also refer to speech, and we think of the nineteenth psalm and the description of the words and testimony of the Lord, "more to be desired than gold, and sweeter than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb" (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>). The words of pure, inward joy flowing forth from the lips may be so described. So the Lord has said, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>, that he rejoiceth over his people as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride.

The bride is not yet brought to the royal palace. She is still travelling in the royal palanquin. The idea of a paradise or garden is carried from the beginning of Scripture to the end, the symbol of perfect blessedness. The figure of the closed or shut-up garden represents the bridegroom's delight in the sense of absolute and sole possession - for himself and no other. The language is very natural at such a time, when the bride is being taken from her home. We may compare with the figures here employed those in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thy plants <i>are</i> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants, spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</span> <span class="accented">Thy shoots</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that which comes forth from thee, thy plants, or, as Bottcher puts it, "all the phenomena and life utterances of her personality." All the plants had their meaning in flower language. They are mostly exotics. But it is difficult now to suggest meanings, though they may have been familiar to Jewish readers at the time. The <span class="accented">pardes</span>, "park, or enclosure," was adorned especially with foreign and fragrant plants of great beauty. It is an Old Persian word, perhaps, as Delitzsch suggests, from <span class="accented">pairi</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) and <span class="accented">dez</span> (Pers. <span class="accented">diz</span>), "a heap."  <span class="accented">Precious fruit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fructus laudam</span>, "fruits of renown" or excellence (cf. Syriac <span class="accented">magdo</span>, "dried fruit"). The <span class="accented">carcom</span>, or saffron, a kind of crocus (Ind. <span class="accented">safran</span>), yields the saffron colour from its dried flower eyes, used both as a cosmetic and as a medicine (cf. Sansc. <span class="accented">kuakuma</span>). The <span class="accented">calamus</span>, simply a reed, the sweet reed, a corn indigenous to the East. <span class="accented">Cinnamon</span> (<span class="accented">Quinnamon</span>)<span class="accented">, Laurus cinnamomum</span>, is indigenous on the east coast of Africa and Ceylon, found later in the Antibes. The inner bark peeled off and roiled together forms the cinnamon bark (see Pliny, bk. 12). There are seven spices mentioned. We need not trouble ourselves to identify them all, as they are mostly Indian, and such as Solomon would fetch from the far East in his celebrated ships. The description is highly poetical, and simply means that all sweetness and attractiveness combine in the fair one. But symbolically we may see an allusion to the spread of the Church over the world, and all the glory and honour of the nations" being introduced into it. So the graces of the individual soul expand themselves under the influence of Christian truth and fellowship.

Referring, of course, to the clear, cool streams coming down from the snowy heights. The sweet freshness of the country maiden suggested this. May we not see a symbol of the spiritual life in such language (cf. <a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>)? Ethically, at least, the blending of the freshness of a mountain stream with the luxuriance and fragrance of a cultivated garden is very suggestive. To an Eastern monarch, such purity and modesty as Solomon found in his bride must have been a rare excellence which might well be made typical. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/4-16.htm">Song of Solomon 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, <i>that</i> the spices thereof may flow out.

She is yet unworthy of the king and of his love until the seasonal changes have developed and unfolded and spread forth her excellences. The north represents cold; the south, heat. Let the various influences from different quarters flow gently over the garden and call forth the fragrance and the fruits (cf. <a href="../../par/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>). There is rich suggestion in such words. Whether we think of the individual soul or of the Church of Christ, the true desire of those who delight in the love of the Saviour is that all the gifts and graces which can be bestowed may make them worthy of him who condescends to call his people his delight. Surely it is no mere romantic idyll that is before us. Such significance cannot be a mere coincidence when it is so transparent and so apt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/songs/5.htm"><title>Song of Solomon 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/songs/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/songs/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/songs/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/4.htm" title="Song of Solomon 4">&#9668;</a> Song of Solomon 5 <a href="../songs/6.htm" title="Song of Solomon 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">I am come into my garden, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.

There were celebrated plantations at Jericho. The Queen of Sheba brought "of spices very great store;" "There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon." Is there a reference to the conversion of the heathen nations in this? The wine and milk are what God offers to his people (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>) without money and without price. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> is what Chloe gives to Daphnis (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>). It would seem as though the writer intended us to follow the bridal procession to its destination in the royal palace. The bridal night intervenes. The joy of the king in his bride is complete. The climax is reached,  and the rest of the song is an amplification. The call to the friends is to celebrate the marriage in a banquet on the second day (see <a href="../../par/genesis/29-28.htm">Genesis 29:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; Tobit 11:18; and cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> and Revelation 19:9). A parallel might be found in <a href="../../par/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>, where Messiah, at the close of his sufferings, salutes his friends, the poor, and as they eat at his table gives them his royal blessing, "Vivat cor vestrum in aeternum!" The perfect state of the Church is represented in Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New, as celebrated with universal joy - all tears wiped away from off all faces, and the loud harpings of innumerable harpers. Can we doubt that this wonderful book has tinged the whole of subsequent inspired Scripture? Can we read the descriptions of triumphant rejoicing in the Apocalypse and not believe that the apostolic seer was familiar with this idealized love song? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-2.htm">Song of Solomon 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">I sleep, but my heart waketh: <i>it is</i> the voice of my beloved that knocketh, <i>saying</i>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, <i>and</i> my locks with the drops of the night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2-ch. 8:4.</span> - Part IV. REMINISCENCES OF LOVE DAYS. <span class="accented">The bridegroom rejoicing in the bride.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">The bride's reminiscence of a love dream. <span class="cmt_word"></span>I was asleep, but my heart waked, It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</span> There is a resemblance between this account of what was apparently a dream, and that which is related in <a href="../../par/songs/3-1.htm">Song of Solomon 3:1-4</a>; but the difference is very clear. In the former case the lover is represented as dismissed for a season, and then the relenting heart of the maiden sought after him and found him. In this case he "stands at the door and knocks," coming in the night; and the maiden rises to open, but finds him gone, and so is drawn after him. The second dream is much more vivid and elaborate, and seems to be an imitation and enlargement of the other, being introduced apparently more for the sake of dwelling on the attractions of the beloved one and his preciousness in the eyes of the maiden than in self-reproach. Is it not possible that the poem originally concluded at <a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a> with the marriage, and that the whole of the latter half was an amplification, either by Solomon himself, the author of the first half, or by some one who has entered into the spirit of the song? This would explain the apparent repetition, with the variations. But, at all events, the second part certainly is more from the standpoint of married life than the first. Hence the bride speaks at great length, which she does not in the earlier portion. Delitzsch thinks that this second love dream is intended to represent what occurred in early married life; but there are two objections to that - <span class="accented">first</span>, that the place is evidently a country residence; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, that such an occurrence is unsuitable to the conditions of a royal bride. It is much more natural to suppose that the bride is recalling what occurred in her dream when the lover, having been sent away until the evening, as on the former occasion, returned, and in the night knocked at the door. "My heart waked" is the same as "My mind was active." The "heart" in Hebrew is the inner man, both intellect and feeling. "I was asleep, but I was thinking" (cf. Cicero, 'De Divinatione,' 1:30). The lover has come off a long journey over the mountains, and arrives in the night time. The terms with which he appeals to his beloved are significant, denoting <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> equal rank - <span class="accented">my sister</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> free choice - <span class="accented">my love</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> purity, simplicity, and loveliness - <span class="accented">my dove</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> entire devotion, undoubting trust - <span class="accented">my undefiled. Tammanthi</span>, "my perfection," as Arabic <span class="accented">tam, teim</span>, "one devoted to another." as a servant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Similar passages are quoted from heathen love poetry, as Anacreon, 3:10; Propertius, 1:16-23; Ovid, 'Amor.,' 3:19, 21. The simple meaning of the dream is that she is full of love by night and by day. She dreamed that she was back in her old country home, and that her lover visited her like a shepherd; and she tells how she sought him, to show how she loved him. When we are united to the Saviour with the bonds of a pledged affection, we lose the sense of self-reproach in the delight of fellowship, and can even speak of our own slowness and backwardness only to magnify his grace. We delight to acknowledge that it was his knocking that led us to seek after him, although we had to struggle with the dull heart; and it was not until it was moved by his approach, by his moving towards us, that we hastened to find him, and were full of the thought of his desirableness. There are abundant examples of this same interchange of affection in the history of the Church's revivals and restorations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-3.htm">Song of Solomon 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?

I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span> Evidently the meaning is, "I have retired to rest; do not disturb me." She is lying in bed. The <span class="accented">cuttoneth</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, was the linen garment worn next the body - from <span class="accented">cathan</span>, "linen." The Arabic <span class="accented">kutun</span> is "cotton;" hence the French <span class="accented">coton</span>, "calico, or cotton" shift. Shulamith represents herself as failing in love, not meeting the condescension and affection of her lover as she should. Sloth, reluctance, ease, keep her back. "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion!" The scene is, of course, only ideally true; it is not meant to be a description of an actual occurrence. Fancy in dreams stirs up the real nature, though it also  disturbs it. Shulamith has forsaken her first love. She relates it with sorrow, but not with despondency. She comes to herself again, and her repentance and restoration are the occasion for pouring out the fulness of her affection, which had never really changed, though it has been checked and restrained by self-indulgence. How true a picture both of the individual soul and of the Church in its decline! "Leave me to myself; let me lie at ease in my luxury and my smooth, conventional ways and self-flattering deceit." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-4.htm">Song of Solomon 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">My beloved put in his hand by the hole <i>of the door</i>, and my bowels were moved for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.</span> The door hole is a part of the door pierced through at the upper part of the lock, or door bolt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>), that is, by the opening from without to within, or through the opening, as if, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to open the door by pressing back the lock or bolt from within. There was some obstacle. He tailed to open it. It had not been left so that he could easily obtain admittance. The metaphor is very apt and beautiful. How much he loved her! How he tried to come to her! As applied to the Saviour, what infinite suggestiveness! He would be with us, and not only knocks at the door, but is impatient to enter; tries the lock, and too often finds it in vain; he is repelled, he is resisted, he is coldly excluded. <span class="accented">My heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, "my inner being" (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, where the same word is used of God). It is often employed to express sympathy and affection, especially with tender regret. The later authorities, as the older translations, have "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> over him, or on account of him, in the thought of his wounded heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-5.htm">Song of Solomon 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped <i>with</i> myrrh, and my fingers <i>with</i> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.</span> The meaning seems to be that the lover had come to the door perfumed as if for a festival, and the costly ointment which he brought with him has dropped on the handles of the bolts. Similar allusions may be found in Lucretius and other heathen writers. This description is, of course, inapplicable to the shepherd theory. It would not be a rough country swain that came thus perfumed; but Solomon is thought of as at once king and lover. It would be stretching the poetry too far to suppose that Shulamith meant the natural sweetness of her lover was the perfume. Neither is there any probability in the explanation that she dipped her hand in perfumed oil before she opened the door. That would destroy all the form and beauty of the dream. It is her lover whose fragrance she celebrates, not her own. Whether he brought perfumes with him, or the innate personal sweetness of his presence left its fragrance on that which he touched, in either case it is the lover himself who is spoken cf. His very hand, wherever it has been, leaves behind it ineffable delight. His presence reveals itself everywhere. Those who go after him know that he is not far off by the traces of his loving approaches to them. The spiritual meaning is too plain to need much exposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-6.htm">Song of Solomon 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, <i>and</i> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> The meaning is this - The voice of my beloved struck my heart; but in the consciousness that I had estranged myself from him I could not openly meet him, I could not offer him mere empty excuses. Now I am made sensible of my own deficiency. I call after him. I long for his return, but it is in vain (cf. the two disciples going to Emmaus, <a href="../../par/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, "Did not our heart burn within us," etc.?). Similar allusion to the effect of the voice of the beloved is found in Terence, 'And.,' 1:5, 16, "Oratio haec," etc. The failing or departing of the soul at the sound of the voice must refer to the lack of response at the time, therefore it was that she sought him and cried out after him. <span class="accented">When he spake</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in his speaking</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he said, "I will not now come because at first refused;" cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>, the solemn warning against the loss of opportunity. It is a coincidence between the two books of Solomon which cannot be disregarded. If there is any spiritual meaning at all in Solomon's Song, it certainly is a book which he who wrote the first chapter of Proverbs is likely to have written. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span> The intention is to show into what evil she fell by having to seek her beloved instead of being with him. She is mistaken and misjudged; she is smitten and wounded with reproaches and false accusations, as though she were a guilty and evil minded woman. She is subjected to abuse and ill treatment from those who should be her guardians. She had hard work to escape, leaving her robe behind her (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>). The <span class="accented">redhidh</span>, like <span class="accented">ridha</span> in Arabic, is a plaid-like upper garment thrown over the shoulders - so says Aben Ezra; but it is derived, no doubt, from the root "to make broad or thin," to spread out - perhaps, therefore, "a thin, light upper robe" which was worn over the chiton, a summer overdress, a cloak (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">pallium</span>; Luther, <span class="accented">Schleier</span>). If we take the dream thus described, and which seems to conclude at this point, as related to the  surrounding ladies, then we must suppose that it is introduced for the sake of what follows. The bride feels that she does not love her beloved one half enough; she is so conscious of deficiencies, that she might even have acted as her dream represented. It had entered her soul and made her ill with inward grief and self-reproach. She might so act, she might so treat her husband. So she adjures her companions to tell him how much she loves him. The spiritual application is not difficult to see. When the soul loses its joy in Christ, it becomes the prey of fears and self accusations, and even of reproaches from Christ's servants and the guardians of his Church. For when our religion ceases to be a spontaneous delight to us, we are apt to carry on even the active work of our life in a manner to be misunderstood by sincere believers around us. Yea, the very efforts we make to recover peace may bring reproach upon us. Any Christian minister who has had to deal with religious despondency will quite understand this dream of the bride's. We may often smite and wound, and even deprive of the garment of reputation and esteem, those who are really seeking for Christ, because we have misunderstood them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-8.htm">Song of Solomon 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I <i>am</i> sick of love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</span> This appeal to the ladies suggests that the bride is speaking from her place in the royal palace; but it may be taken otherwise, as a poetical transference of time and place, from the place where the dream actually occurred, to Jerusalem. It is difficult, in a poem of such a kind, to explain every turn of language objectively. We cannot, however, be far wrong if we say the bride is rejoicing, in the presence of her attendant ladies, in the love of Solomon. He has just left her, and she takes the opportunity of relating the dream, that she may say how she cannot bear his absence and how she adores him. The ladies enter at once into the pleasant scheme of her fancy, and assume that they are with her in the country place, and ready to help her to find her shepherd lover, who has turned away from her when she did not at once respond to his call. The daughters of Jerusalem will, of course, symbolically represent those who, by their sympathy and by their similar relation to the object of our love, are ready to help us to rejoice - our fellow believers.

The word <span class="accented">tsach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">tsahach</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>), means a bright, shining clearness; it is not the same as <span class="accented">lavan</span>, which would mean "dead white." So in Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The red <span class="accented">adhom</span>, from the root <span class="accented">dam</span>, which means "to condense," is dark red (<span class="accented">rouge puce</span>), no doubt as betokening health and vigour. The pure, delicate white among the Caucasians denotes high rank, superior training, hereditary nobility, as among ourselves the "aristocratic paleness" (cf. Hom., 'I1,' 4:141, "<span class="accented">ivory with purple</span>;" Virg., 'AEn.,' 12:65; Ovid, 'Am.,' 2; ' Eleg.,' 5:39; Hor., Od., 1:13, etc.; Tibull., 'Eleg.,' ext. 4, etc.). The chiefest, that is, the distinguished one, the chosen (so the Greek versions, Syriac, Jerome, Luther). The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">e cohorte selectus.</span> Another rendering is "bannered," furnished with a banner or pennon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) hence the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> as a past participle (so the Venetian <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The numeral (<span class="accented">revava</span>) "<span class="accented">ten thousand"</span> is simply used to represent an innumerable multitude; "myriad" is so used among ourselves (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">His head <i>is as</i> the most fine gold, his locks <i>are</i> bushy, <i>and</i> black as a raven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks; washed with milk and fitly set. His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs; his lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl; his body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span> This description, which is complete in itself, is best regarded in its unbroken perfection. We must not expect to find a meaning for each separate part of it. There are ten corporeal excellences enumerated. We naturally recall the descriptions in Daniel and in the Apocalypse, which certainly have reference to this, and manifestly combine the attributes of greatness and beauty in the Son of man. Solomon, no doubt, as the son of Bathsheba, was distinguished by his personal attractions. Some of the details of description are differently rendered by different commentators. Delitzsch regards the description of the hair in ver. 11 as compared to a hill or hilly range" his locks hill upon hill," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his hair, seen from his neck upwards, forms in undulating lines hill upon hill." The black colour is no  doubt mentioned as a contrast with the fair, white complexion. The eyes are not only pure and clear, but with a glancing moistness in them which expresses feeling and devotion. So Plutarch has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to denote a languishing look, and we find the same figure in the 'Gitagovinda ' and Hafiz, and in Ossian. So Luther, "Und stehen in der Falle." The pureness of the white of the eye is represented in the bathing or washing in milk. They are full and large, "fine in their setting," referring no doubt to the steady, strong look of fine eyes. "The cheeks" are compared to towers of plants; that is, there is a soft elevation in them. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">Sicut areolae aromatum consitae a pigmentariis.</span> The Targum says, "Like the rows of a garden of aromatic plants, which produce deep, penetrating essences, even as a (magnificent) garden aromatic plants" - perhaps referring to the "flos juventae," the hair on the face, the growth of the beard. "The lips" are described as the organs of speech as well as inviting to embrace. They drop words like liquid fragrance. "The bands" may be differently described according as they are viewed. Delitzsch says, "His hands form cylinders, fitted in with stones of Tarshish." Gesenius thinks the comparison is of the closed hand and the stained nails, but that seems farfetched. Surely it is the outstretched hands that are meant. The form of the fingers is seen and admired; they are full, round, fleshy like bars of gold. The word "Tarshish" may mean clay white, as in the Greek versions; that is, <span class="accented">topaz</span>, called Tarshish from Tartessus in Spain, where it is found. The description of the body is of the outward appearance and figure only, though the word itself signifies "inward parts." The comparison with ivory work refers to the glancing and perfect smoothness and symmetry as of a beautiful ivory statue, the work of the highest artistic excellence. The sapphire covering tempers the white. The beautiful blue veins appear through the skin and give a lovely tint to the body. So in the description of the legs we have the combination of white and gold, the white marble setting forth greatness and purity, and the gold sublimity and nobleness; intended, no doubt, to suggest that in the royal bridegroom there was personal beauty united with kingly majesty, as in the following description of his general aspect, which, like the splendours of the mountains, was awe-inspiring and yet elevating and delightful (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11</a> (10): <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). His mouth, or palate, is sweetness itself; that is, when he speaks his words are full of winning love (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>). We may compare with the whole description that given of Absalom, Solomon's brother, in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25, 26</a>. It has been truly remarked by Zockler that "the mention of the legs, and just before of the body, could only be regarded as unbecoming or improper by an overstrained prudishness, because the description which is here given avoids all libidinous details, and is so strictly general as not even to imply that she had ever seen the parts of the body in question in a nude condition." It merely serves to complete the delineation of her lover, which Shulamith sketches by a gradual descent from head to foot, and, moreover, is to be laid to the account of the poet rather than to that of Shulamith, who is in everything else so chaste and delicate in her feelings. Certainly it would be much less delicate regarded as the description of a shepherd lover who is seeking to obtain possession of the maiden taken from him, than of the royal bridegroom to whom Shulamith is at all events affianced, if not already married. The highest spiritual feelings of loving adoration of the Saviour have welcomed some parts of this description, and adopted them into the language of "spiritual songs." To some minds, no doubt, it is repellent; to those to whom it is not so, the warmth and glow of Eastern language is by no means too realistic for the feelings of delight in the Lord which express themselves in rapturous music. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?</span> The dialogue still continues, possibly because, as Delitzsch suggests, the effect of the dream which Shulamith narrates is not passed away in the morning. Under the influence of it she goes forth and meets the daughters of Jerusalem, who offer their assistance. But there is no necessity for this. The poetry merely demands that the idea of the dream should  be still kept before the mind of the reader. The scene is still in the palace. The ladies playfully carry on the bride's cue, and help her to pour out her feelings. The bridegroom, they know, is near at hand, and is coming to delight himself in his bride; but the bride has not yet drawn him back completely to her side. This is evident from the fact that there is no distress in the language of the bride. She is not complaining and crying out in agony under a sense of desertion; she is waiting for the return of her beloved, and so she calmly sings of his love and his perfect truthfulness, even though absent from her. He is where his perfect beauty and fragrance might well be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/6-2.htm">Song of Solomon 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</span> In <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5, 6</a> Solomon says, "I planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared." In <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> it is said, "The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their Shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of water of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes." We can scarcely doubt that the meaning is - The bridegroom is not gone far; he is where he is congenially employed; where his pure and lovely nature finds that which is like itself - beauty and fragrance and innocence. It is his resort, and it corresponds with his perfection. Delitzsch thinks "thoughtfulness and depth of feeling are intended" (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>). "His thoughts are very deep." But it would seem more fitting, in the lips of the bride, that she should dwell on the aspects of her beloved which correspond with her own feelings. She is one of the lilies. The king is coming into his garden, and I am ready to receive him. The shepherd among his flock. They are all like lilies, pure and beautiful. The bride has nothing but chaste thoughts of her husband: because she knows that he is hers, and she is his. Surely such language is not inaptly applied to spiritual uses. Tennyson's lovely poem, 'St. Agnes' Eve,' has caught the spirit of Shulamith. A few of his lines will illustrate this - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The shadows of the convent towers<br />Slant down the snowy sward,<br />Still creeping with the creeping hours<br />That lead me to my Lord.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Make thou my spirit pure and clear<br />As are the frosty skies,<br />Or this first snowdrop of the year<br />That in my bosom lies.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">He lifts me to the golden doors;<br />The flashes come and go;<br />All Heaven bursts her starry floors,<br />And strews her lights below,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">And deepens on and up! the gates<br />Roll back, and far within<br />For me the heavenly Bridegroom waits,<br />To make me pure of sin.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">The sabbaths of eternity,<br />One sabbath deep and wide,<br />A light upon the shining sea -<br />The Bridegroom with his bride."</span>

Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing, whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> The king is not far off. The bride knows that he is near. She prepares herself for him with words of love. He is coming among his "rosebud garden. of girls." His voice is heard as he approaches. And as he enters the chamber he bursts forth with lavish praises of his bride. Tirzah and Jerusalem, two of the most beautiful cities of the world, are taken as symbols of the surpassing beauty of the bride - doubtless also with an intended reference to the symbology of Scripture, where the people of God are compared throughout to a city. Tirzah was discovered by Robinson in 1852, on a height in the mountain range to the north of Nablus, under the name <span class="accented">Tulluzah</span>, high and beautiful, in a region of olive trees. The name itself signifies sweetness, which might be so employed even if there were no actual city so called. Jerusalem is said to have been "the perfection of beauty" (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). Cities are generally spoken of as females, as also nations. The Church is the city of God. The new Jerusalem is the bride of the Lamb. If the prophets did not take their language from this Song of Solomon, then the phraseology and symbology which we find here must have been familiarly known and used among the people of Israel from the time of Solomon. The beauty of the bride is overwhelming, it is subduing and all-conquering, like a warrior host with flying banners going forth to victory. Solomon confesses that he is vanquished. This, of course, is the hyperbole of love, but it is full of significance to the spiritual mind. The Church of Christ in the presence and power of the Lord is irresistible. It is not until he appears that the bride is seen in her perfection. She hangs her head and  complains while he is absent; but when he comes and reveals himself, delighting in his people, their beauty, which is a reflection of his, will shine forth as the sun forever and ever. The word which is employed, "terrible," is from the root "to be impetuous," "to press impetuously upon," "to infuse terror," LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to make to start up," referring to the flash of the eyes, the overpowering brightness of the countenance. So the purity and excellence of the Church shall delight the Lord, and no earthly power shall be able to stand before it. Heaven and earth shall meet in the latter days. Wickedness shall fly before righteousness as a detbated host before a victorious army. Is there not something like a practical commentary on these words in the history of all great revivals of religion and eras of reformation? Are there not signs even now that the beauty of the Church is becoming more and more army-like, and bearing down opposition? The remainder of the description is little more than a repetition of what has gone before, with some differences. Mount Gilead is here simply Gilead. The flock of shorn sheep is here the flock of ewes with their young. Perhaps there is intended to be a special significance in the use of the same description. The bride is the same, and therefore the same terms apply to her; but she is more beautiful than ever in the eyes of the bridegroom. Is it not a delicate mode of saying, "Though my absence from thee has made thee complain for a while, thou art still the same to me"? There is scope here for variety of interpretation which there is no need to follow. Some would say the reference is to the state of the Church at different periods - as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to the primitive Church in its simplicity and purity, to the Church of the empire in its splendour and growing dominion. The Jewish expositors apply it to the different stages in the history of Israel, "the congregation" being the bride, as under the first temple and under the second temple. Ibn Ezra, and indeed all expositors, recognize the reason for the repetition as in the sameness of affection. "The beloved repeats the same things here to show that it is still his own true bride to whom he speaks, the sameness in the features proving it." So the Targum. The flock of goats, the flock of ewes, the piece of pomegranate, all suggest the simple purity of country life in which the king found so much satisfaction, he is wrapt up in his northern beauty, and idolizes her. One cannot help thinking of the early Jewish Church coming forth from Galilee, when all spoke of the freshness and genuineness of a simple-hearted piety drawn forth by the preaching of the Son of Mary - the virgin-born Bridegroom whose bride was like the streams and flowers, the birds and flocks, of beautiful Galilee; a society of believing peasants untouched by the conventionalities of Judaea, and ready to respond to the grand mountain like earnestness and heavenly purity of the new Prophet, the Shepherd of Israel, "who feedeth his flock among the lilies." There is a correspondence in the early Church, before corruption crept in and sophistication obscured the simplicity of faith and life among Christians, to this description of the bride, the Lamb's wife. There must be a return to that primitive ideal before there can be the rapturous joy of the Church which is promised. We are too much turned aside from the Bridegroom to false and worthless attractions which do not delight the Beloved One. When he sees his bride as he first saw her, he will renew his praises and lift her up to himself.

Is not that because the time referred to in the poem was early in the reign? The words are an echo of what we read in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a> and <a href="../../par/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>. Perhaps the general meaning is merely to celebrate the surpassing beauty of the new bride. But there certainly is a special stress laid on her purity and innocence. There is no necessity to seek for any exact interpretation of the queens and concubines. They represent female beauty in its variety. The true Church is in closer relation to the Bridegroom than all the rest of the world. Even in the heathen and unconverted world there is a revelation of the Word, or, as the ancient Fathers of the Church said, a <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. He was then as light, though the darkness comprehended him not. The perfection of the true bride of the Lamb will be acknowledged even by those who are not professedly Christian.

The word rendered "looketh forth" is literally "bendeth forward," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order to look out or forth (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>), LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> Venet., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, "stooping down and looking into the Word as into well"). The idea seems to be that of a rising luminary, looking forth from the background,  breaking through the shades of the garden, like the morning star appearing above the horizon (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Venetian) (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>, where the morning star is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>).

The fierce rays of the Eastern sun are terrible to those who encounter them. The glory of the Church is a glory overwhelming as against all that opposes it. The description is pure hyperbole as applied to a fair bride, referring to the blazing beauty of her face and adornments, but symbolically it has always been felt a precious contribution to religious language. Perhaps no sentence in the Old Testament has been more frequently on the lips of devout men, especially when they have been speaking of the victories of the truth and the glowing prospects of the Saviour's kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/6-11.htm">Song of Solomon 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, <i>and</i> to see whether the vine flourished, <i>and</i> the pomegranates budded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded and the pomegranates were in flower. Or ever I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.</span> There cannot he much doubt as to the meaning of these words. Taking them as put into the lips of the bride, and as intended to be a response to the lavish praises of the bridegroom, we may regard them as a modest confession that she had lost her heart immediately that she had seen King Solomon. She went down into her quiet garden life to occupy herself as usual with rustic labours and enjoyments, but the moment that her beloved approached she was carried away - her soul was as in a swift chariot. Delitzsch thinks that the words refer to what occurred after marriage. He supposes that on some occasion the king Look his bride with him on an excursion in his chariot to a plain called Etam. He refers to a description of such a place to be found in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07, 3, but the explanation is far fetched and improbable. The nut or walnut tree (<span class="accented">Juglans regia</span>, Linn.) came originally from Persia. The name is very similar in the Persian, AEthiopic, Arabic, and Syriac. One cannot help comparing the lovely simplicity of the bride's description with the tender beauty of Goethe's 'Herman and Dorothea.' The main point is this, that she is not the mere captive of the king, taken, as was too often the case with Eastern monarchs, by violence into his harem; she was subdued by the power of love. It was love that raised her to the royal chariots of her people. She beholds in King Solomon the concentration and the acme of her people's glory. He is the true Israel; she is the glory of him who is the glory of God.

What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.</span> Shulem is the same as Shunem (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). Shulamite will, therefore, mean "lady of Shulem." It is the first occurrence of the name. It cannot be a pure proper name, says Delitzsch, because the article is attached to it. It is a name of descent. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "she who is from Shunem." Abishag was exceedingly beautiful, and she came from the same district. It is the country in the tribe of Issachar, near to little Hermon, to the southeast of Carmel and south of Nain, southeast of Nazareth, southwest of Tabor. It is found at present under the name <span class="accented">Sawlam</span>, not far from the great plain of Jiszeal (now <span class="accented">Zer'in</span>), "which forms a convenient way of communication between Jordan and the seacoast, but is yet so hidden in the mountain range that the Talmud is silent concerning this Sulem, as it is concerning Nazareth." It is impossible to resist the impression of the fact that this part of Galilee so closely associated with our Lord and his ministry should be the native place of the bride. Delitzsch thinks that the Shulamite is on her way from the garden to the palace. That the words are addressed to her by the admiring ladies can scarcely be disputed; hence the "we" of the address. "The fourfold 'come back' (or, 'turn') entreats her earnestly, yea, with team, to return thither (that is, to the garden) with them once more, and for this purpose, that they might find delight in looking upon her." But Delitzsch is scarcely right in thinking that the garden of nuts to which the bride referred is the garden of the palace. She is, perhaps, turning to leave the company of ladies, Solomon himself beingamong them, as though she would escape from their gaze, which is too much for her in her simplicity, and the ladies, seeing her intention to leave them, call her back. Another view is that the word "return" is for "turn round;" that is, "Let us see thee dance, that we may admire the beauty of thy form and movements." This would explain the appropriateness of the bride's reply in the latter haft of the verse. Moreover, the fourfold appeal is scarcely suitable if the bride was only slightly indicating her intention to leave. She would surely not leave hastily, seeing that Solomon is present. The request is not that she may remain, but that they may look upon her. It would be quite fitting in the mouth of lady companions. The whole  is doubtless a poetic artifice, as before in the case of the dream, for the purpose of introducing the lovely description of her personal attractions. Plainly she is described as dancing or as if dancing. Delitzsch, however, thinks that the dance is only referred to by the ladies as a comparison; but in that case he certainly leaves unexplained the peculiarity of the description in <a href="../../par/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1-5</a>, which most naturally is a description of a dancing figure. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why will ye look upon the Shulamite as upon the dance of Mahanaim?</span> The Shulamite, in her perfect modesty and humility, not knowing how beautiful she really is, asks why it is that they wish still to gaze upon her, like those that gaze at the dance of Mahanaim, or why they wish her to dance. But at the same moment, with the complaisance of perfect amiability, begins to move - always a pleasure to a lovely maiden - thus filling them with admiration. Mahanaim came in later times to mean "angels," or the "heavenly host" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>), but here it is generally thought to be the name of a dance, perhaps one in which the inhabitants of Mahanaim excelled, or one in which angels or hosts were thought to engage. The old translators, the Syriac, Jerome, and the Venetian, render, "the dances of the camps" (<span class="accented">choros castrarum</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), possibly a war dance or parade. The word, however, is in the dual. Delitzsch thinks the meaning is a dance as of angels, "only a step beyond the responsive song of the seraphim" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>.). Of course, there can be no objection to the association of angels with the bride, but there is no necessity for it. The word would be, no doubt, familiarly known in the age of Solomon. The sacred dances wore often referred to in Scripture. and there would be nothing degrading to the dignity of the bride in dancing before the ladies and her own husband. "After throwing aside her upper garment, so that she had only the light clothing of a shepherdess or vine dresser, Shulamith danced to and fro before the daughters of Jerusalem, and displayed all her attractions before them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/songs/7.htm"><title>Song of Solomon 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/songs/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/songs/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/songs/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/6.htm" title="Song of Solomon 6">&#9668;</a> Song of Solomon 7 <a href="../songs/8.htm" title="Song of Solomon 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs <i>are</i> like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</span> To the ladies who are looking on the bride appears simply noble and royal. The word <span class="accented">naudhib</span> which is used, translated "prince's daughter," means "noble in disposition," and so in birth and rank, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>; so in <a href="../../par/songs/6-12.htm">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>, "the princely people." The description, which is perfectly chaste, is intended to bring before the eye the lithe and beautiful movements of an elegant dancer; the bendings of the body, full of activity and grace, are compared to the swinging to and fro of jewelled ornaments made in chains. The cunning workman or artist is one who is master of that which abides beautiful. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, like, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "whose truthful work can be trusted." The description passes from the thighs or loins to the middle part of the body, because in the mode of dancing prevailing in the East the breast and the body, are raised, and the outlines of the form appear through the clothing, which is of a light texture. We must not expect to find a symbolical meaning for all the details of such a description. The general intention is to set forth the beauty and glory of the bride. The Church of Christ is most delightful in his sight when it is most full of activity and life, and every portion of it is called forth into manifest excellence. "<span class="accented">Arise</span>, <span class="accented">shine</span>," is the invitation addressed to the whole Church, "shake thyself from the dust," "put on thy beautiful garments," be ready for thy Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/7-2.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thy navel <i>is like</i> a round goblet, <i>which</i> wanteth not liquor: thy belly <i>is like</i> an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span> It must be remembered that ladies are speaking of one who is in the ladies' apartment. There is nothing indelicate in the description, though it is scarcely Western. The "round goblet," or basin, with mixed wine, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wine with water or snow mixed with it, is intended to convey the idea of the shape of the lovely body with its flesh colour appearing through the semitransparent clothing, and moving gracefully like the diluted wine in the glass goblet. The navel is referred to simply as the center  of the body, which it is in infants, and nearly so in adults. Perhaps Delitzsch is right in thinking that there may be an attempt to describe the navel itself as like the whirling hollow of water in a basin. In the latter part of the verse the shape of the body is undoubtedly intended. "To the present day winnowed and sifted corn is piled up in great heaps of symmetrical, half-spherical form, which are then frequently stuck over with things that move in the wind, for the purpose of protecting them against birds. The appearance of such heaps of wheat," says Wetstein, "which one may see in long parallel rows on the threshing floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the song every Arabian will regard as beautiful." According to the Moslem Sunnas, the colour of wheat was that of Adam. The white is a subdued white, denoting both perfect spotlessness and the purity of health. The smooth, round, fair body of the maiden is seen to advantage in the varied movements of the dance.

This is omitted here, perhaps, only because lilies are just before spoken cf. The description is now in the lips of the ladies; before it was uttered by the king himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thy neck <i>is</i> as a tower of ivory; thine eyes <i>like</i> the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose <i>is</i> as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; thine eyes are as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus</span>. This is plainly a partial repetition of the king's description. The ivory tower was perhaps a tower well known, covered with ivory tablets, slender in structure, dazzlingly white in appearance, imposing and captivating. No doubt in the lips of the court ladies it is intended that this echo of the royal bridegroom's praises shall be grateful to him. Heshbon is situated some five and a half hours east of the northern points of the Dead Sea, on an extensive, undulating, fruitful, high table-land, with a far-reaching prospect. "The comparison of the eyes to a pool means either their glistening like a water-mirror or their being lovely in appearance, for the Arabian knows no greater pleasure than to look upon clear, gently rippling water: cf. Ovid, 'De Arte Am.,' 2:722 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adspicies oculos tremulo fulgore micantes,<br />Ut sol a liquida saepe refulget aqua"</span> The nose formed a straight line down from the forehead, conveying the impression of symmetry, and at the same time a dignity and majesty inspiring with awe like the tower of Lebanon. The reference is perhaps to a particular tower, and in the time of Solomon there were many noted specimens of architectural and artistic splendour. "A tower which looks in the direction of Damascus is to be thought of as standing on one of the eastern spurs of Hermon or on the top of Amana (<a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>), whence the Amana (Barada) takes its rise, whether as a watchtower (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>) or only as a look out from which might be enjoyed the paradisaical prospect." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/7-5.htm">Song of Solomon 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thine head upon thee <i>is</i> like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king <i>is</i> held in the galleries.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof.</span> Carmel is called the "Nose of the mountain range" (<span class="accented">Arf-ef-jebel</span>). It is a promontory. The meaning, no doubt, is the exquisite fitness of the head upon the neck, which is one of the most lovely traits of personal beauty. Some, however, think that the reference is to colour - Carmel being derived from the Persian, and meaning "crimson." This is rejected by Delitzsch, as the Persian would be <span class="accented">carmile</span>, not <span class="accented">carmel</span>. The transition is natural from the position and shape of the head and neck to the hair. The purple shellfish is found near Carmel (cf. Lucian's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and Anacreon's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and similar expressions in Virgil's 'Georgics,' 1:405, and Tibullus, 1:4, 63). The locks of hair are a glistening purple colour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their black is purple as they catch the lights. Hengstenberg, however, thinks that the reference is to the temples, and not to the hair itself; but the use of the term in classical poets is decisive. The lovely head shaking the locks as the body moves gracefully in the dance fills the king with delight and admiration. He is quite captivated, and the ladies, having finished their description of the bride, look at the bridegroom, and behold him quite lost in the fascination - "held captive in the tresses." Delitzsch quotes a similar expression from Goethe, in the 'West Ostliche Divan,' "There are more than fifty hooks in each lock of thy hair." The idea of taking captive is frequent in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; Sirach 9:3, 4). Thus ends the song of the ladies in praise of the bride. We must suppose that the king, who is probably present, then takes up the word, and pours out his heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - (<span class="accented">Song of the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride.</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. I said, I will climb up into the palm tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples; and thy mouth like the best wine, that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of them that are asleep.</span> The  abstract "love" is plainly here used for the concrete, "O loved one." It is just possible that the meaning may be - How delightful is the enjoyment of love! but the bodily description which follows suggests that the words are addressed directly to Shulamith. We certainly have in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, an apostolic apostrophe to love, which Delitzsch calls the Apostle Paul's spiritual song of songs. But it would be somewhat irrelevant here. The king is deeply moved as he watches the beautiful figure before him, and delights in the thought that so lovely a creature is his own. The rapture which he pours out may be taken either as a recollection of how he was captivated in the past, or the past may be used for the present, as it frequently is in Hebrew. The meaning is the same in both cases. The palm tree may be selected on account of its elegance, but it is commonly employed in Eastern poetry as the emblem of love. The mystical writers use it to denote the Divine manifestation. The comparison of the breasts to clusters of grapes is quite natural, but no doubt reference is intended to the fruit as luscious and refreshing. Both the palm and the vine in the East are remarkable for the abundance and beauty of their fruits. In the case of the palm - "dark brown or golden-yellow clusters, which crown the summit of the stem and impart a wonderful beauty to the tree, especially when seen in the evening twilight." The palm and the vine are both employed in Scripture in close connection with the Church. "The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree;" "The vine brought out of Egypt" (Ps <a href="../../par/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>.), and the "vineyard of the beloved" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and the "true vine," to which the Lord Jesus Christ compares himself, remind us that the illustration was perfectly familiar among the Jews; and we can scarcely doubt that the reference in this case would be understood. The Lord delighteth in those "fruits of righteousness" which come forth from the life and love of his people. They are the true adornment of the Church. The people of God are never so beautiful in the eyes of their Saviour as when they are covered with gifts and graces in their active expression in the world. Then it is that he himself fills his Church with his presence. The ninth verse is somewhat difficult to explain. The words are no doubt still in the lips of the king. There is no change of speaker until ver. 10, when Shulamith replies to the king's adoring address. Ginsburg says, "Her voice is not merely compared to wine because it is sweet to everybody, but to such wine as would be sweet to a friend, and on that account is more valuable and pleasant." The Authorized Version is supported by some critics as the best, "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak." Delitzsch adheres to this. The LXX. renders it thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "accommodating itself to my lips and teeth." So Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Jerome, <span class="accented">Labiisque et dentibus illius ad ruminandum.</span> Luther strangely renders, "which to my friend goes smoothly down and speaks of the previous year" (pointing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). Another rendering is, "which comes unawares upon the lips of the sleepers." Some think it refers to the smacking of the lips after wine. "Generous wine is a figure of the love responses of the beloved, sipped in, as it were, with pleasing satisfaction, which hover around the sleepers in delightful dreams, and fill them with hallucinations." Another reading substitutes "the ancient" for "them that are asleep." The general meaning must be wine that is very good and easily taken, or which one who is a good judge of wine will praise. It is possible that there is some slight corruption in the text. The passage is not to be rendered with absolute certainty. Delitzsch and others think that it is an interruption of the bride's, but they have little support for that view. The bride begins to speak at ver. 10.

It seems possible that a portion of the bride's speech may have dropped out - "My beloved is mine" - or she may wish to adopt the language of <a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, and represent herself as a true wife, whose husband is wrapt up in her love. By "desire" is intended the impulse of love, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, "to move or impel." The thought seems to be this - As my beloved is full of worshipping affection, and I am wholly his, let his love have free course, and let us retire together away from all the distractions and artificiality of the town life to the simplicity and congenial enjoyments of the country, which are so much more to my taste. The more real and fervent the religious emotions of the soul and the spiritual life of the Church, the more natural and simple will be their expression. We do not require any profuse ceremonies, any extravagant decorations, any complicated and costly religions services, in order to draw forth in the Christian Church the highest realization of the Saviour's fellowship. We want the Christianity we profess to take possession of us, body and soul. And so it will be as Christians learn more of Christ.

The solitude and glory and reality of external nature are dearer to her than the bustle and splendour of the city and of the court. By "the field" is meant the country generally. The village or little town surrounded with vineyards and gardens was the scene of Shulamith's early life, and would always be delightful to her. The word is the plural of an unused form. It is found in the form <span class="accented">copher</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), meaning "a district of level country." Delitzsch renders, "let us get up early," rather differently - "in the morning we will start" - but the meaning is the same. The word <span class="accented">dodhai</span>, "my love," is "the evidences or expressions of my love" (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/4-16.htm">Song of Solomon 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-2.htm">Song of Solomon 1:2</a>). No doubt the bride is speaking in the springtime, the Wonnemond of May, when the pulses beat in sympathy with the rising life of nature.

We are, of course, reminded of <a href="../../par/genesis/30-14.htm">Genesis 30:14</a>, where the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, when the son of Leah found mandrakes in vintage time. They produce their effect by their powerful and pleasant fragrance. They are said to be only rarely found in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, but they were abundant in. Galilee, where Shulamith was brought up. The Arabs called them <span class="accented">abd-el-sal'm</span>, "servant of love" - <span class="accented">postillon d'amour.</span> We are not wrong in using that which is perfectly natural and simple for the cherishing and increasing of devout feeling. The three elements which coexist in true spiritual life are thought, feeling, and action. They support one another. A religion which is all impulse and emotion soon wears itself out, and is apt to end in spiritual vacuity and paralysis; but when thought and activity hold up and strengthen and guide feeling, then it is scarcely possible to endanger the soul. The heart should go out to Christ in a simple but fervent worship, especially in praise. There are no Christians who are more ready to devote themselves to good works than those who delight much in hearty and happy spiritual songs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/songs/8.htm"><title>Song of Solomon 8 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/songs/8.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/songs/8.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/songs/8-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/7.htm" title="Song of Solomon 7">&#9668;</a> Song of Solomon 8 <a href="../isaiah/1.htm" title="Isaiah 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-1.htm">Song of Solomon 8:1</a></div><div class="verse">O that thou <i>wert</i> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! <i>when</i> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!

I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</span> The meaning seems to be this - Let our relation to one another be the highest and the purest and the most permanent possible. The sisterly relation is not merely one of affection, but one of blood. The bond between husband and wife may be broken by the caprice and weakness of human feeling, but nothing can destroy the bond of blood. "A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>); "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). The brotherly bond represents the strength of the blood relationship. When to that is added personal affection, then the tie is perfect. Shulamith means that she would have their love freed from all the uncertainties of human fickleness. As symbolically interpreted, therefore, we take this whole passage to signify that the Church, when it is desiring the closest fellowship with the Saviour, would be lifted above all the temptations of earthly life, which so often lower the standard of Christian feeling and service. The words are specially impressive in the lips of the bride of Solomon. It is a testimony to the inspiration of the whole book that the voluptuous monarch, whose life fell so far below the ideal of a godly king, should yet, indirectly though still powerfully, condemn and rebuke his own departure from God, setting clearly before us the surpassing excellence of pure love and the sanctity of married life. In the Mug's address to his bride he called her "sister" and "sister-bride;" she now virtually returns his own sentiment and calls him "brother."' She shows that she has risen in her love far above the mere fleshly desires - "the lust of the fiesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." She would blend her whole existence with that of her Lord. <span class="accented">I would</span> <span class="accented">kiss thee</span>; <span class="accented">yea, and none would despise me.</span> Nothing can more exquisitely and delicately express the fulness of affection. It is not merely a return for that which is given; it is free and spontaneous. So should our spiritual feelings be. They should be the natural outpouring of the soul towards the Saviour; not a worked up, artificial, spasmodic impulse, not a cold, dead formalism, not an unsympathetic service of conscience; but "doing the will of God from the heart." "Love is the fulfilling of the Law;" "Faith worketh by love." The second verse is differently rendered by some. Jerome, Venetian, and Luther take it as referring to the bride's dependence on her husband's superior wisdom - "Thou wouldest instruct me;" which, of course, is a very suitable sentiment as addressed to the wise King Solomon. The Targum expounds it thus: "I would conduct thee, O King Messiah, and bring thee into the house of my sanctuary; and thou wouldest teach me to fear God and to walk in his ways." Hitzig and our Revisers take the verb as in the third person feminine, and applied to the mother. "She would teach me as a mother teaches a young bride, from her own early experience." The old view that the bride is the personification of wisdom seems quite refuted by this speech of Shulamith's. She desires and waits for instruction. Solomon is wisdom. She is the soul of man, or the Church of God, delighting to sit at his feet and learn of him. Whichever rendering we choose, whether the mother or Solomon be regarded as teacher, the meaning is the same. It is, as Delitzsch has observed, a deep revelation of Shulamith's heart. "She knew how much she yet came short of being to the king all that a wife should be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; in her mother's house, if he were once there, he would in. struct her, and she would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the pomegranates." The "spiced wine," <span class="accented">vinum conditura</span>, aromatic wine, probably grape wine "mixed with fragrant and pungent  essences," as in the East. The juice, or pressed juice, of the pomegranate is a delicious drink. There is no allusion to any love symbol. The grains of the pomegranates were said by the Arabians to be from Paradise (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "vinum de punicis quod roidem vocant" in Dioscorides and Pliny). Perhaps this reference to exchange of gifts may be taken as symbolizing the happy state of the Church when she pours out her treasures in response to the spiritual blessings which she is freely receiving. The meaning is something beautiful and precious. And that is the highest state of religious life when the service we render and the gifts we place on the altar are felt to be the grateful sacrifices of our hearts under a sense of Divine love. When the Church of Christ depends for its support on such fellowship between itself and the Saviour there will be no limits to its attainments, no achievements beyond its powers. "All that see" such a state of the Church "shall acknowledge" the glory of it, "that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed" (see the whole of the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, which breathes the very spirit of Solomon's Song). The rejoicing bride then gives herself up to the thought of her husband's affection. In that beautiful simplicity and purity of her childhood's life she would realize the bliss of her new relation. Delitzsch describes her state of mind thus: "Resigning herself dreamily to the idea that Solomon is her brother, whom she may freely and openly kiss, and her teacher besides, with whom she may sit in confidential intercourse under her mother's eye, she feels herself as if closely embraced by him, and calls from a distance to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb this her happy enjoyment." Perhaps the sense of weakness and dependence is meant to be expressed. The bride is conscious that her lord is everything to her. In that identification which the highest love brings vividly into the soul, there is the joy of exultation. "All things are ours; and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's."

Love is its own lord. Let it have free course. Let it perfect itself in its own best way. The form of the adjuration is abbreviated in this case. The omission of the words, "By the roes and by the hinds of the field," is not without its significance. Is it not intended to intimate that the <span class="accented">natural</span> love, to which reference was made by the introduction of the beautiful wild creatures of the field, is now no more in the thoughts of the bride, because it has been sublimated into the higher sisterly love of which she has been speaking? She is not merely the lovely woman on whom the king dotes because of her personal beauty; she is his companion and dearest friend. He opens his heart to her. He teaches her. He lifts her up to his own level. She participates in his royal dignity and majesty. The <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of her first estate of love is now exalted into the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, which is the grace never to be without its sphere, abiding forever. We must not press too closely the poetic form of the song. Something must be allowed for the framework in which the main ideas are set before us. It may not be possible to answer the question - Who are intended to be symbolized by the daughters of Jerusalem? There is no necessity to seek further into the meaning of the whole poem than its widest and most general application. But the daughters of Jerusalem are in a lower position, a less favoured relation to the bridegroom, than the bride herself. We may, therefore, without hesitation, accept the view that by the adjuration is intended the appeal of the higher spiritual life against all that is below it; the ideal love calling upon all that is around it and all that is related to it to rise with it to perfection. The individual soul is thus represented claiming the full realization of its spiritual possibilities. The Church of God thus remonstrates against all that hinders her advancement, restrains her life, and interrupts her blessedness. Jerusalem has many daughters. They are not all in perfect sympathy with the bride. When they listen to the adjurations of the most spiritual, the most devoted, the most heavenly and Christ-like of those who are named by the Name of the Lord, they will themselves be lifted up into the bridal joy of "the marriage supper of the Lamb." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-5.htm">Song of Solomon 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">Who <i>is</i> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth <i>that</i> bare thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - Part V. CONCLUSION. THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE IN THE SCENE OF THEIR FIRST LOVE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</span> We must compare this question with the corresponding one in <a href="../../par/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>. In that case the inhabitants of Jerusalem are supposed to be looking forth, and behold the bridal procession approaching the capital. In this case the scene is transferred to the country, to the neighbourhood of the bride's home, where she has desired to be with her lord. The country people, or the group of her relatives, are supposed to be gazing at the pair of lovers, not coming in royal state, but in the sweet simplicity of true affection, the bride leaning with loving confidence on the  arm of her husband, as they were seen before in the time of their "first love." The restoration of "first love" is often the prayer of the disciple, feeling how far he falls short of the affection which such a Master should call forth. The first feelings of the heart when it is won to Christ are very delightful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Where is the blessedness I knew<br />When first I saw the Lord?<br />Where is the soul-refreshing view<br />Of Jesus and his Word?"</span> It is a blessedness when we come up from the wilderness. It is a joy to ourselves and a matter of praise to our fellow believers when we are manifestly filled with a sense of the Saviour's presence and fellowship. The word <span class="accented">midhbaur</span>, translated "wilderness," does not, however, necessarily mean a desolate and barren desert, but rather the open country, as the Valley of Jezreel The LXX. had either a different reading in the Hebrew or has mistaken it. They have rendered the last clause "clothed in white," which perhaps Jerome has followed with his <span class="accented">deliciis affluens</span>. The word is, however, from the root <span class="accented">rauvaq</span>, which in the hiph. is "to support one's self." The meaning, therefore, is, "leaning for support." It might, however, be intended to represent the loving confidence of married life, and therefore would be equivalent in meaning to the Greek and Latin renderings, that is, "Who is this? Evidently a young newly married wife with her husband." Perhaps this is the best explanation of the words as preparing for what follows, as the bridegroom begins at once to speak of the first love. Some think that the road in which the loving pair are seen to be walking brings their footsteps near to the apple tree over against Shulamith's house where they had first met. But there is no necessity for that supposition. It is sufficient if we imagine the apple tree to be in sight. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Under the apple tree I awakened thee; there thy mother was in travail with thee; there was she in travail that brought thee forth.</span> I awakened thee; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I stirred thee up to return the affection which I showed thee (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7</a>). The Masoretic reading prints the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, as with the masculine suffix, but this renders the meaning exceedingly perplexed. The bride would not speak of awakening Solomon, but it was he who had awakened her. The change is very slight, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;</span> becoming <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;</span>, and is supported by the Old Syriac Version. It must be remembered that the bridegroom immediately addresses the bride, speaking of her mother. The apple tree would certainly be most naturally supposed to be situated somewhere near the house where the bride was bore perhaps overshadowing it or branching over the windows, or trained upon the trellis surrounding the house. The bridegroom points to it. "See, there it is, the familiar apple tree beside the house where thy dear self wast born. There, yonder, is where thy mother dwelt, and where thou heartiest my first words of affection as we sat side by side just outside the house under the shade of the apple tree." The language is exquisitely simple and chaste, and yet so full of the tender affection of the true lover. The spot where the first breathings of love came forth will ever be dear in the remembrance of those whose affection remains faithful and fond. The typical view certainly finds itself supported in these words. Nothing is more delightful and more helpful to the believer than to go over in thought, again and again, and especially when faith grows feeble, when the heart is cold and fickle under the influence of worldly temptations and difficulties of the Christian course, the history of the first beginning of the spiritual life. We recall how dear the Lord was to us then, how wonderful his love seemed to us, how condescending and how merciful. We reproach ourselves that we faint and fail; we cry out for the fulness of grace, and it is given us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <i>is</i> strong as death; jealousy <i>is</i> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <i>are</i> coals of fire, <i>which hath</i> a most vehement flame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very flame of the Lord. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly contemned.</span> Is this to be regarded as the reply of the bride to the tender allusion of her husband to their first love; or is it, as some think, only the first words which belong to the bride, while the rest of the two verses are a kind of chorus echoing her loving appeal, and bringing the general action of the poem to a conclusion? It is difficult to decide this, and the meaning is not affected either way. Perhaps, however, it is best to take it as spoken by the bride, who continues her address to the end of the eighth verse. She is full of joy in the return of perfect confidence; she prays that the full tide of affection may never cease to flow, that there be no ebbing of that happy feeling in which she now delights; and then sings the praise of love itself, as though a prelude of praise to a long and eternal peace. The seal is the signet ring, <span class="accented">chotham</span>, from a root "to impress" It was sometimes carried by a string on the breast, and would, therefore, be near the heart (see <a href="../../par/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>). It was sometimes worn on the hand (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; and cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>). It was not worn on the arm like a bracelet (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>). Probably it was not the signet ring which is referred to in the second clause: "Set me as a seal on thine  heart, and as a bracelet on thine arm." The same simile is not infrequent in the prophets. The desire of Shulamith was to escape all possibility of those declensions of which she had spoken before. "Let me never be out of thy thoughts; let me never go back from my fulness of joy in thy love." The true believer understands well such language. He knows that the maintenance of devout affection is not a matter of mere desire and will. The Lord himself must help us with his blessed gifts, the influence of his gracious Spirit to overcome the feebleness and fickleness of a fallen heart. We want to be close to the heart of the Saviour; we want to be constantly in his eye, and so diligently employed in his service, so closely associated with the work of his mighty arm, that we shall be ever receiving from him the signs and evidences of his approval and affection. The purity and perfection of true love are the theme of every sincere believer. The priceless value of such love is described in the Book of Proverbs (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), in <a href="../../par/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. It is an unquenchable flame - nothing can resist it. We cannot but recall the rapturous language of one who himself was an example of the highest devotedness to the Saviour, who rejoiced over death and the grave in the consciousness of victory through him from whose love nothing can separate us (<a href="../../par/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). Certainly the history of the sufferings and trials of the true Church form a most striking commentary upon these words. Floods of persecution have swept over it, but they have not quenched love. The flame has burst forth again and again when it seemed to be extinguished, and it has become a very "flame of the Lord." The bush has been burning, but has not been consumed. By jealousy is intended love in its intensity not bearing arival. The "flame of the Lord" may be compared with "the voice of the Lord," which is described in Hebrew poetry as connected with the fury of the storm. The flame, therefore, would be lightning and the voice thunder. The whole of this passage, which forms a kind of keynote of the poem, is more like a distinct strain introduced to give climax to the succession of songs than the natural expression of the bride's feelings. It has been always regarded as one of the sublimest apostrophes to love to be found anywhere. The enemies of God and of humanity are represented as falling before it, death and the grave. Its vehemence and force of manifestation are brought vividly before us by the comparison of the flash of lightning. It is remarkable that this exaltation of love should be included in the Old Testament, thus proving that the Mosaic Law, with its formal prescriptions, by no means fulfils the whole purpose of God in his revelation to the world. As the New Testament would not have been complete without the message of the beloved disciple, so this Old Testament must have its song of love. Nor is it only the ideal and the heavenly love which is celebrated, but human affection itself is placed very high, because it is associated with that which is Divine. It is a more precious thing than mere wealth or worldly honour, and he that trifles with it deserves the utmost scorn and contempt of his fellows. It is well to remark how consistently the poetic framework is maintained. There is no attempt to leave the lines of human relations even at this point, whets evidently the sentiment rises above them. The love which is apostrophized is not removed from earth in order to be seen apart from all earthly imperfections and impurities. We are invited rather to look through the human to the Divine which embraces it and glorifies it. That. is the method of the Divine revelation throughout. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." We do not need to take Solomon's Song as an allegory. It is a song of human love, but as such it is a symbol of that which is Divine.

"She hath no breasts" is equivalent to saying she is not yet mature, of marriageable age (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). The question which the bride asks of King Solomon refers to the promise which he is supposed to have made, and which he is virtually pledging himself to fulfil by this visit to the country home of his queen. "What shall be done for the advantage of my little sister? Let us consult together" (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>). "The day when she shall be spoken for" is the day when she shall attract the attention of a suitor. It must necessarily be difficult to find satisfactory interpretations forevery detail in such a poem of human love as this. It might be sufficient to see in this reference to the younger sister the general idea of love's expansion. Those who are themselves the objects of it, being full of exquisite happiness, desire to call others into the same joy. This is true both of the individual and of the Church. <span class="accented">What shall be done for others?</span> That is the question which is awakened in every heart where true love is at work. There is no need to explain the language further. But the allegorists have been very ingenious in attempting to find meanings forevery allusion of the poem. Who is the little sister? What is her virginity? What  is the day in which she shall be spoken for? Some have said that the little sister represents the firstfruits of the Jews and Gentiles received into the Christian Church immediately after the time of our Lord's ascension, as Beza and others. Some, again, take it to mean the whole body of Jews and Gentiles yet to be converted. Others would see in it those that are weak in faith, the beginners in Christian life. And, again, it has been regarded as pointing to the "daughter of Zion" at the time of the first beginnings of her conversion to the heavenly Solomon, which is the view of Hengstenberg and others. There is no end to such fancies. The broad general meaning is all that we can rest upon. The bride naturally thinks of her sister. It is a lovely incident in a perfectly idyllic poem. The visit to the home is quite in harmony with the fresh, pure, and simple life which reveals itself in all the utterances of the bride, and is honoured by the devoted attention of the splendid monarch. It is a real touch of nature when the young bride, in her family life once more, asks what shall become of her sister. It is an exquisite type of that sisterly solicitude with which all true Christians will care for the souls around them. Delitzsch thinks that the question which is asked by the bride is answered by her brothers, as they were the actual guardians of the little sister (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>:50, 55; 34:6-8). But there is no necessity to introduce any new interlocutors at this point. The words are certainly addressed to Solomon. It is quite natural that he should reply to them in a royal style, with the <span class="accented">pluralis majestatis</span> which suits the corresponding position of the bride as a suppliant for her sister. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-9.htm">Song of Solomon 8:9</a></div><div class="verse">If she <i>be</i> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she <i>be</i> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar</span>. The interpretation which Delitzsch suggests of these words is that the "wall" represents firmness of character, and the "door" weakness and insecurity. If she firmly and successfully withstands all immoral approaches, then we will bestow high honour upon her, as a tribute to her maidenly virtue and constancy. The turret or castle of silver would mean rewarding her with increase. Silver is the emblem of holiness, gold of nobility. The meaning may, however, merely be, "We will endow her with plenty." The boards of cedar are supposed to be special protections, as cedar is noted for its hardness and durability. But is not the meaning much simpler and more natural? It would be rather a far fetched use of the figure of a door that it should suggest seduction, and would be rather unsuitable in the lips of the bridegroom when speaking of the little sister of his own bride. May not the meaning be no more than this? - She may become one of the most substantial parts of the building, like a wall; in that ease all that she can be she shall be; we will put the highest honour upon her. She may be a door, that is, though not so great and substantial as the wall, still in the very front of the building and before the eyes of all. In that case we will beautify her with costly and fragrant adornment. The gate shall be enclosed in cedar wood. "The wall and the door," says Zockler, "are mostly understood of the steadfast and faithful keeping of the Word of God and of its zealous proclamation to the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, etc.); but some also explain them of the valiant in faith and the weak in faith, or of the learned and simple, or of faithful Christians and such as are recreant and easily accessible to the arts of seduction. And then, according to these various interpretations, the 'silver bulwarks' are now the miracles of the first witnesses of Jesus, now the distinguished teachers of the Church, now pious Christian rulers, now the testimonies of Holy Scripture by which faith is strengthened. And, again, by the 'cedar boards' are sometimes understood the ten commandments or the Law, sometimes Christian teachers, sometimes the examples of the saints, sometimes the salutary discipline of the cross and sufferings for Christ's sake," etc. All such attempts at detailed interpretation fail to give satisfaction. Their effect is to repel many from the study of the book altogether, just as the follies and. extravagances of the interpreters of prophecy have greatly hindered the study of the prophetic Scriptures. The <span class="accented">wall</span> and the <span class="accented">door</span> need not be taken as opposed to one another, as they are not in our conceptions of a city. They fulfil different functions. The <span class="accented">wall</span> is for <span class="accented">defence</span>; the door is for <span class="accented">admission.</span> In the one case we think of <span class="accented">strength</span>, and in the other case of <span class="accented">beauty.</span> The application of the symbols is very easy if the general meaning alone is regarded. There is a variety of capacity and function in the Church of Christ. There are differences in the forms of Christianity among different nations. But the Lord will receive and bless all. Some are not fitted to be built upon as strong wails, but they may still be beautiful examples of Christian graces in the eyes of the world, through whom many gladly enter into the truth and into the fellowship of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-10.htm">Song of Solomon 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof: then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to brings a thousand pieces of silver. My vineyard, which is mine, is</span>  <span class="cmt_word">before me: thou, O Solomon, shalt have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</span> The meaning seems to be affectionate approval of the method just described. Solomon says, "If the young sister be, worthy of love, she shall receive more and more of defence and honour; she shall be all that I can make her." The bride takes up this thought. "So it is with me, and, in the spirit of thankful acknowledgments and praise, I will respond to all the favour of the king. King Solomon has loved me, and now I am rising higher and becoming more and more glorious because of his love." The typical reference can scarcely be missed. The Church, the bride of the Lamb, shines only in the light of him whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life. The comparison to a city with the walls and towers, while it would seem a little far fetched in a love song, is quite in place if the typical intention was in the mind of the writer. He was thinking of the city of God, "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth." "One that findeth peace" is the same as "one that findeth favour," that is, one who is the object of his affection. There are several references which confirm this, such as <a href="../../par/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>. The word "peace" (<span class="accented">shalom</span>) is in all probability purposely chosen in this case as a kind of play on the name <span class="accented">Solomon</span>, which appears immediately afterwards. "The king of peace delights in me because I am peace in his eyes." The Church is after the image of the King. His likeness in her makes her beautiful. Men take knowledge of Christians that they have been with Jesus (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). It is scarcely necessary to point out that this language of the bride is entirely against the shepherd theory. She could not have talked of finding peace in his eyes if she was torn from her true lover. The bride then goes on to express her devotedness to the king and her desire to bring forth abundance for him. She uses as an example, which perhaps was typical in her time and country, some remarkably fruitful vineyard of the king's. She will, in like manner, realize all his highest wishes. All that she has shall be his. The name Baal-hamon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. Judith 8:3), designates probably a place near to Sunem, somewhere to the north, on the further side of the Plain of Jezreeh The produce of the vineyard must have been very large, as every keeper was to bring in for himself a thousand shekels of silver. It is not stated how many keepers there were, but the word which is employed is not "servants," but "watchers, or overseers." A vineyard was divided into portions, with a certain definite prescribed number of vines in each portion. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a> we read, "And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings shall even be for briers and thorns." Now, a thousand silverlings was one shekel, so that if this passage can be taken as throwing light on what the bride says, it would imply that, instead of one shekel forevery thousand vines, every keeper brought a thousand shekels. That would seem impossible, so that the parallel can scarcely be strict. Perhaps the largeness of the vineyard is referred to, and each of the keepers would have many thousands of vines under his inspection. The general meaning, however, is not obscure. The vineyard was a celebrated one, and was taken as a typical instance of fertility and abundance. When the bride speaks of her vineyard which is before her, there may be an allusion to her previous manner of life as a rustic maiden employed in the vineyards, and to her own position as a keeper or as one of the family. But this is not intended to be prominently expressed. The whole spirit of the poem justifies the view that she is speaking of her person. She invited Solomon to rejoice in the beauty and fragrance of her garden, to pluck the fruits, to revel in the delights. Everything that is pleasant and lovely is before him (see <a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>). <span class="accented">Before me</span>; that is, in my power is all this delight, and my desire is to my husband; all that I have is his. Like the far-famed keepers of Baal-hamon, I will give the king a thousand shekels, that is, the utmost that the vineyard can produce, and "those that keep the fruit thereof" shall have two hundred - perhaps meaning a hundred each, that is a tenth, which was the ancient tithe due to the priests. It may be, however, that a double tithe is intended. The king shall be satisfied, and all those who labour for the king shall be more than ever rewarded. If we take such words as typical, they point to a state of things in the history of the kingdom of God when the spiritual and the temporal shall be perfectly adjusted. The keepers of the vineyard have often made sad havoc of the vineyard itself because of their greedy discontent. The fruits which have been yielded by the Church have fallen very far short. The husbandmen have ill treated the Lord's servants. But all the judgments which have been poured out both upon ancient Jews and upon the corrupt Christendom of later times have been directed to one end, to make the vineyard of the Lord more fruitful, to remove the things which are offensive in his sight, to satisfy him whose soul travailed for his people; for herein is the Father glorified in the Son, when them  who bear the name of the Beloved "bear much fruit." Then the keepers of the vineyard will themselves rejoice, not that they reap a larger harvest of this world's good, not "for filthy lucre's sake," but because their hearts are one with his whose vineyard they keep, and to see the fruit abound is to fill them with joy. Surely we shall recognize in such language an anticipation of the many allusions which are found both in the prophets and psalms and in the discourses of our Lord himself. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver.</div><div class="comm">

There cannot be much doubt that these are the words of the bridegroom. They are addressed to the bride. She is the dweller in the gardens; that is, one who is at home in the gardens, whose beauty blends with the rural loveliness around her. The king wishes his bride to understand that she is only acceptable in his sight, and that all that she asks shall be granted. It is delightful to him to hear her voice, as it is delightful to those who have been accustomed to that voice from her childhood. "Dear country girl, sing to me, and let me revel in the sweetness of thy music. 'Thy companions hearken for it' - thy former associates, the playmates of thy youth. And while they gather round us, and you and I rejoice in one another, let the sound of thy voice mingle with the peaceful beauty of this earthly paradise." There is an exquisite tenderness in this conclusion of the poem. The curtain falls, as it were, upon a scene of mutual confidence and affection, the simplicity of the bride's early home being lifted up into the royal splendour of the king's presence, the companions beholding and praising, while, in the midst of all that sunny bliss and peaceful content, the voice of the Bride is heard singing one of the old, familiar strains of love with which she poured out her heart in the days when her beloved came to find her in her home. It is impossible to conceive a more perfect conclusion. It leads up our thoughts to the laud of light and song, where "the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be the Shepherd" of those who shall "hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat;" "and he shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes" (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16, 17</a>). It is sad to think that Solomon himself fell from such an ideal of human affection, and was unfaithful to such a bride. But there is no need to trouble the clear, transparent beauty of this typical poem by any reference to the incidents of the writer's own history. He placed it on the altar of God, no doubt, at a time when it represented sincere feelings in his heart, and because he was inspired to see that it would be profitable to the people of God as a mirror in which they could behold the reflection of the highest truth. But though he himself fell away from his high place as a prophet of God, the words which he left behind him were still a precious gift to the Church. It is otherwise with him who is typified by the earthly monarch. He who is the heavenly Bridegroom has himself to lift up the weakness and fickleness of his bride by fellowship with her, until she is above the reach of temptation, and partaker of his own glory. And he does so, as this exquisite poem reminds us, by the power of his love. It is the personal influence of the Lord Jesus Christ which must glorify the Church and restore it to its original simplicity and spirituality. The scene into which we are led in this story of bridal affection typifies a state of the Church when the artificiality of court life shall be abandoned, the magnificence of mere external pomp and ritual shall be left behind, and the bride shall simply delight herself in the Bridegroom among the pure and peaceful surroundings of a country home. The Church will realize the greatness of her power when she is delivered from that which hides her Saviour, when she is simply human and yet entirely spiritual; then the Lord of her life, the second Adam, the perfect Man, who is from heaven and in heaven, but still on earth, changing earth to heaven by his love, will fulfil his promise. "He not merely concludes the marriage covenant with mankind, but likewise preserves, confirms, refines, and conducts it step by step to its ideal consummation, which is at the same time the palingenesia and perfection of humanity." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/songs/8-14.htm">Song of Solomon 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</span> This is a snatch of the old love songs which the bride used to sing when love was fresh and young. She sings it now at the request of her bridegroom himself, and in the delighted ears of her companions. She goes forth from among, them leaning on her beloved, to rejoice in the beautiful scenery and rural pleasures with him whose presence heightens every joy, the life of her life, the soul of her soul, "all her salvation, all her desire." The bridegroom and the bride are seen disappearing together over the flowery hills; and the music of the Song of Songs dies away in the sweet fragrance of that closing scene; the vision of love has, gazelle-like, leapt from point to point, and vanishes away at last among the mountains of spices. It is well to notice that what were before "mountains of Berber," that is, of "separation," are now "mountains of  Besamin" - balsam mountains. There is no more word of separation. Henceforth the only note is one of peaceful enjoyment. "<span class="accented">My beloved is mine, and I am his."</span> Our home and haunt is the same. The concluding words, we cannot doubt, are intended to open a perfect future to the eye. Yet the poet, with consummate art, connects that future with the past and the present by the voice of the bride heard singing the love song with which she first expressed her love, now lifted up into anticipation of the everlasting hills of fragrant and joyful life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../songs/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
