In its first verse it adds the words (Authorized Version), "concerning the Name of the Lord" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to the glory of God"), after the words, <span class="cmt_word">the fame of Solomon. Sheba</span>. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-22.htm">1 Chronicles 1:22</a>); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, <a href="../../par/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a> (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (<a href="../../par/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, here as also in the parallel. This word is used twenty-one times, and in a slightly varied form (as in the ninth verse of this same chapter) nine more times. It is almost always translated (Authorized Version) by this same word "spice" or "spices" (except <a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>). There are other Hebrew words for "spices," such as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<a href="../../par/songs/8-2.htm">Song of Solomon 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-10.htm">Ezekiel 24:10</a>); but the "spice" or "spices" designated by our present word, and the exact name or nature of which cannot be certainly pronounced upon, was in great request for domestic, ecclesiastical, funeral (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>), and other purposes, and was a chief export from Arabia, Syria, and Persia. <span class="cmt_word">Gold in abundance</span>. Of course, it is not necessary to suppose that the gold that came either now from Sheba, or even from Ophir, was obtained from the immediate region; as seen before, there may have been a special market or emporium for them there<span class="cmt_word">. Precious stones</span>. These were used for sacred purposes, and for domestic and dress ornaments, and were graven upon in early times by the Hebrews The chief of those mentioned in the Old Testament are the carbuncle, sardius, topaz (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), diamond, emerald, sapphire (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>); <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), agate, amethyst, ligure (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-12.htm">Exodus 39:12</a>), beryl, jasper, onyx (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-6.htm">Exodus 39:6, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), ruby (<a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>), chrysolite, chrysoprasus (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The precious stones which the queen brought are likely enough, however, to have comprised other varieties (including the pearl from the Persian Gulf), such as Pliny describes; and see in particular <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; and the art. "Stones, Precious," in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1382. <span class="cmt_word">All that was in her heart</span>. The expression simply <span class="cmt_word">means all that she had so desired to get information upon, since she had heard of the fame of Solomon.</span>

Translating our thoughts rather violently into modern language, we might picture the queen inspecting the <span class="accented">kitchens</span> of the palace, and remember that the kitchens of an Oriental court did the work, not of an individual "table," but of those of a very large domestic and official retinue; much more these of Solomon now. Keil and Bertheau, however, with others, refer this expression to the set-out of one meal-table (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that of a modern banquet, wedding breakfast, or the like), where both the abounding lading of the table and the ample variety of the courses, and the rich foreign or home fruits, in season or out of season, and the furnishing and decorating of the table, all come in to add their contribution of effect; and they quote not inaptly our ver. 20, elucidated by <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>. This was a daily glory with Solomon's palace-establishment. The immediate connection and the contents of this verse, though difficult, favour this direction of explanation, as will be seen in the succeeding clauses. <span class="cmt_word">The sitting of his servants</span>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) occurs forty-three times, and is rendered in the Authorized Version thirty-two of these times as "habitation" or "dwelling." Of the remaining eleven times, one or other of those words would be almost the synonym of the word used, and in every ease the rendering "dwelling," if kept to the general idea of a dwelling or resting-place more or less <span class="accented">temporary</span>, would not be inappropriate or inconsistent with the evident drift of the connection; only here and in the parallel is the inconvenient rendering "sitting" adopted by the Authorized Version. Hence we disagree with Professor Dr. Murphy's explanation, <span class="accented">the sitting, i.e.</span> "in council of his chief officers." What the nature of the <span class="accented">location</span> (to use a term least specific) of the servants pointed to here is, nevertheless, still not quite clear. It is evidently placed in some antithesis with the <span class="accented">standing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the standing-place) here rendered 'inadequately or incorrectly, <span class="cmt_word">the attendance of his ministers</span>. <span class="accented">The attendance, i.e.</span> "the station (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>) (see the four other occurrences of this' word: <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>). <span class="accented">Of his ministers</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, participle of a piel verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word, in an amazing majority of the hundred occurrences of it, expresses ministry of <span class="accented">sacred</span> service of some kind. It may, indeed, be said that the present passage, with only one or two others, are doubtful in this meaning or character of explanation. To our next clause, referring to <span class="cmt_word">their apparel</span>, we find in the parallel mention, as here, of the <span class="cmt_word">cupbearers</span>, though the matter of <span class="accented">their</span> apparel is not included as it is here. Part of the difficulty of the verse arises from the consideration that up to this point the contents of the successive clauses of it may compose possibly enough a sharp graphic description of the daily banquet scene. An apt reference to similar description of Arabian banquets is given in the 'Speaker's Commentary ' as to be found in vol. it. pp. 213-215 of 'Ancient Monarchies.' Our next clause, however, brings us back into difficulty by its reference to Solomon's <span class="cmt_word">ascent</span> by <span class="cmt_word">which he went up into the house of the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> with our Exposition, 'Pulpit Commentary'), apparently so unseasonably; nor are we much helped by reading, with the Septuagint, "the burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord." The obscurity and lack of coherence are not formidable, indeed, and perhaps may be with moderate satisfaction set down again to the account of the occasionally careless selection of the compilers from the material of the older work. Possibly the allusion in our ver. 11 to the <span class="accented">terraces</span>, or stairs, or highways (see margin) to "the house of the Lord," <span class="accented">and to the king's palace</span>, may hold some clue to the <span class="accented">ascent</span> being adverted to here.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-9.htm">2 Chronicles 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and twenty talents of gold</span>. Putting the value of gold at &pound;4 per ounce, the value of one talent would be &pound;5476, making a total of &pound;657,120. Poole makes it &pound;1,250,000; S. Clarke, f 720,000. From our vers. 13, 14 we learn that in one year Solomon received 666 talents, beside what merchants brought. <span class="cmt_word">Any such spice</span>. The parallel has "no more such abundance of spices," and "of spices very great store." The Arabian spices, and their land and even sea borne fragrance, as also the very lucrative trade they created, are often alluded to by historians (see, among many others, Herod., 3:113; Diod., 3:46; Strabo, 16:4, &sect; 19). Much of all this so-termed <span class="accented">giving</span> was evidently matter of <span class="accented">exchange</span>. The queen got <span class="accented">quid pro quo</span>, while ver. 13 of the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a>.) seems to speak of the other truer giving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Either these two verses are misplaced (with their parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>), or they ought to have, though unstated, some occult bearing on the queen. There are some slight indications pointing to this, and the meaning is perhaps that the terraces, balustrades, stairs (which possibly is the idea in the "ascent," ver. 4), pillars, etc., made of the wood which Hiram's and Solomon's servants had <span class="accented">formerly</span> brought with gold, were the artificial-work wonders which helped to astound the queen. <span class="cmt_word">Terraces to the house of the Lord, and to the king's palace</span>. These so rendered <span class="accented">terraces</span> were probably stairs, and, as already intimated, may have composed the "ascent" (ver. 4), and explain the mention of it in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The algum trees.</span> This is the Hebrew text order of the <span class="accented">lamed</span> and <span class="accented">gimel</span> alphabet characters, as the Authorized Version order in the parallel <span class="accented">almug</span> is also the order of its Hebrew. The tree is mentioned only six times - three times in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>) and three times in Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>). Apparently this wood did grow in Lebanon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>), though we think this not certain. Kimchi thinks it was the bukkum (Arabic word), which Europeans call Brazil wood, and which (Keil) was found in Ethiopia, as well as India. Some think it the sandal-wood of Malabar. Whatever it was, it no doubt was to be purchased at the emporium of Ophir. The intrinsic nature of the wood, and its intrinsically valuable nature, may easily be inferred from its use for the woodwork and sounding-board woodwork of musical instruments like the <span class="accented">harp</span> and <span class="accented">psaltery.</span> This fact would much incline to the view that the <span class="accented">red</span> sandal-wood is what is here called algum. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes Max Muller ('Lectures on Language,' 1st series, p. 191) for the statement that the vernacular for this wood in India is <span class="accented">valguka</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Harps...  psalteries</span> (see our Exposition on 2 Chronicles 5:12, and articles in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and others. The sentence, <span class="cmt_word">there were none such seen in the land of Judah,</span> may Be read as an indication that they had been part of the exhibition made to the Queen of Sheba. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-11.htm">2 Chronicles 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the king made <i>of</i> the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</div><div class="comm">

The parallel has not this obscure clause, but has, "beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal Bounty." Professor Dr. Murphy explains our clause as purporting to say this: Solomon gave all the queen's desire in the way of bounty, "beside" all that belonged as an equivalent for "what she had brought." She got so much sheer gift, beside all that, according to the then Eastern custom, was her due.

Gesenius mentions Turkish, Persian, and Sanscrit derivations that would well suit it. It is very noticeable that it is employed also by the writer of Kings. It is used of a ruler in the Assyrian empire (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>), in the Chaldean (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>), in the Persian (<a href="../../par/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/9-3.htm">Esther 9:3</a>), specially of the Persian governor of Judaea (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-26.htm">Nehemiah 12:26</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>); while Gesenius reads this passage in our present text and its parallel, to speak of governors of <span class="accented">Judaea</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">country</span>). See also <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>, where the word is translated (Authorized Version) "captains," and is in the Syrian king's mouth. The word is not used before Kings. It is used by the writer of Kings three times; of Chronicles, once; by Ezra, six times; in Nehemiah, eight times; in Esther, three times; in Daniel, four times; and in the remaining prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, Malachi, ten times in all. The Authorized Version, out of the whole number of these occurrences of the word, has rendered it "captains" thirteen times; "deputies," twice; and "governors," twenty times.

Now, the <span class="accented">maneh</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>), or pound, meant 100 bekas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels. Thus the targets, or shields, had six manehs of gold to their plating each, and the lesser <span class="accented">bucklers</span> (as we may perhaps call them) three manehs each. On the estimate that the shekel weighed 9 dwt. 3 gr., since the maneh weighed fifty shekels (100 <span class="accented">bekas</span>, or half-shekels), the gold to a shield (target) may be put at something over 11 lbs. troy. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the forest of Lebanon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an armoury (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>).

The parallel adds that "the top of the throne was round behind" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>). Comparing also the two accounts, it would appear that there were twelve lions on each side of the throne, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two to each step. When it is said that <span class="cmt_word">there were two lions standing by the stays</span> (or, <span class="accented">arms</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on each side of</span> the sitting-place, we may easily imagine, from ancient modelled thrones, that of them the arms were themselves "no small part." It is remarkable that the parallel does not take cognizance of the footstool. The lion is, of course, as natural a symbol as it is an old one of sovereign power and place; and the use of the lion and the number of them, reminding of the tribes of Israel, were specifically justified to the people, whose oracles contained such words as those in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>. Josephus tells us that a golden bull supported the seat of the throne. If so, it is remarkable that the statement should be omitted in both of our Old Testament narrations. The dimensions of the throne we might have looked for, but they are not given. That they were well proportioned to the height, marked by six steps, may be taken for granted.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - To Tarshish. The parallel has, in both clauses of its verse (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), "ships <span class="accented">of</span> Tarshish." The order of the words in the former clause of our present verse, that compels us to read, "going to Tarshish," certifies the correct meaning. The word "Tarshish" (the subsequent <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>) covered a district in South Spain, as well as named a town and river, and stretched opposite the coast of Africa. Both coasts were beneath Phoenician rule, and a voyage to Tarshish would most naturally mean calling at many a port, and many an African port, from one and another of which all the imports here spoken of would be obtainable. The meaning of the Hebrew root of Tarshish is "to subjugate." The town lay between the two mouths of the river Baetis, now Guadal-quiver. Gesenius thinks that the writer of Chronicles says, in ignorance, "to Tarshish." and that the ships went to Ophir! These passages do not say that the voyage, whatever it was, took three years; much less that that length of time was necessary. Whether voyages were in Solomon's time made <span class="accented">from</span> the Red Sea, circumnavigating Africa, into the Mediterranean, is not certain. If they were such voyages, taken at a sauntering pace, with calls at many ports and easygoing delays, they may easily have consumed as long a space of time as three years! The theory that Tarshish was Tarsus in Cilicia is easily and conclusively negatived. The names in Hebrew of "ivory, apes, and peacocks" have been said to be of Indian origin. This is far from proved, and, as regards the first two, may be said to be sufficiently disproved. But if it all were so, still the fact that the Hebrew names were of an Indian language derivation would go very short way to prove that the Hebrew people got the things represented by them direct, or at all, from India. <span class="cmt_word">Ivory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The Authorized Version rendering "ivory" occurs ten times in the Old Testament, having for its original the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-17.htm">2 Chronicles 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-14.htm">Song of Solomon 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>). In <span class="accented">all</span> these cases, two of them being in closest juxtaposition with the present and its parallel occasion, the word speaks of ivory that is being used, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as though it were manufactured material or ready for manufacture. But in our passage and its parallel, where the different word given above is found, it is manifest that it speaks of the material, so to say, in the rough, as just "tooth or tusk of ?;" but, further, what the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is is not yet ascertained. It is not a word known in the Hebrew vocabulary. Gesenius finds the Sanscrit <span class="accented">ibhas</span>, which signifies an "elephant;" Canon Rawlinsen finds in some Assyrian inscriptions a word <span class="accented">habba</span>, used of both elephant and camel, but probably having for its generic signification "a great animal;" Keil (on the parallel) finds a Coptic word, <span class="accented">eboy</span>, the Latin <span class="accented">elephas</span>, to which he prefixes the Hebrew article <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>. The Targum Jonathan shows at once <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>. Gesenius, in his 'Thesaurus,' calls also timely attention to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>, where we read, "They brought thee a present, horns of ivory <span class="accented">and</span> ebony" (Hebrew, Chethiv, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>; Keri, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). But no use of "ebony" happens to be mentioned in the connection of our present passages or subject. Thus it will be seen that no little ingenuity has been employed to hunt down this little word, though as yet not quite successfully. More may be seen in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:906. <span class="cmt_word">Apes</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., p. 390) says, "This word is identical with the name of the <span class="accented">monkey</span> in <span class="accented">Tamil."</span> Keil connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>, but does not believe, with Gesenius, that the animal came from India, but Ethiopia. In a valuable note in the' Speaker's Commentary' we read, "It is found" (not stated <span class="accented">where</span>) "that the word was an Egyptian word, signifying a kind of monkey, in use in the time of Thothmes II., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about the time of the Israelites' exodus." (For Herodotus's testimony respecting ivory and apes in North Africa, see his 'Hist.,' 4:91.) <span class="cmt_word">Peacocks</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' p. 393') says a Tamil word, <span class="accented">tokei</span>, means "peacock." Keil proposes to consider it one of the later Romans' luxurious delicacies, <span class="accented">aves Numidicae</span>, from Tuoca, a town in Mauretania or Numi-alia. Some translate it "guinea-fowl," and some "parrots." The peacock did not belong to Africa, yet still it may have been purchaseable at some port there.
