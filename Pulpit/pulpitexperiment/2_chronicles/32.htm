This verse and these items of it may without any inconvenient strain be made conterminous with just one verse in Kings, the thirteenth of <a href="../../par/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>. The king personally seems to have devoted himself especially to the siege of Lachish, an Amoritish city indeed originally, and a place of great strength of petition, but conquered by Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 31-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span> here and in parallel). This invasion of Sennacherib (Herod., 2:141), son of Sargon, may be with moderate certainty affixed to the date  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. <span class="accented">Thought</span> to <span class="accented">win</span>. A weak rendering for the preferable <span class="accented">purposed</span> or <span class="accented">boasted to break them</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Hezekiah saw... and that he purposed... Jerusalem</span>. Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had <span class="accented">been paid</span>, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and "took counsel," etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an <span class="accented">offer</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still "purposed to fight against Jerusalem" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2-4</a>, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which <i>were</i> without the city: and they did help him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To stop the waters of the fountains... without the city</span>. These fountains or springs were probably those represented by <span class="accented">En Rogel</span>, on the <span class="accented">Ophel spur</span> or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance "tower," in <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>) for "stopping" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word "stop" eight times, and otherwise "shut" or "closed," or to carry a derived meaning, "hidden" or "secret." If the word "shut" or "shut off" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running <span class="accented">westward</span> from the springs and the Gihon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339). This pool was very probably none other than the pool of Siloam.

Compare the Septuagint, which has it, "through the midst <span class="accented">of the city</span>;" and compare foregoing verse and note; and see again above reference to Courier's 'Handbook' at length.

Note also the word "all" here, side by side with the "much" of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And raised</span> (it) <span class="cmt_word">up to the towers</span>. Discard this Authorized Version rendering. The meaning cannot be certainly pronounced upon, but perhaps it may be intended to say that he <span class="accented">heightened</span> the towers. The objection is that the same verb is wanted for the next clause, and that its rendering would need to be there slightly reduced again to a mere statement of raising from the ground (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> building) another <span class="cmt_word">wall without.

On the other side, there is very little additional in our narrative, a few words heightening the effect in our vers. 18, 20, 21, constituting the whole of such additional matter. The vague mark of time, <span class="cmt_word">after this</span>, with which our present verse opens, merely says that in due course of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, and attack of the fenced cities (ver. 1), he proceeds to send his servants and his insolent defiances to the metropolis, Jerusalem itself. The three words in italics, "himself <span class="accented">laid</span> "siege," should evidently give place to the single word "remained" or "was;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he and all his host with him remained at, or opposite to, Lachish, while his servants went to defy Jerusalem in his name.

This Authorized Version rendering is manifestly incorrect, though, if we simply omit the article, and tender <span class="accented">in siege</span>, we shall probably have Sennacherib's exact idea. He spoke not of the literal technical thing siege, but of the distress and confinement that the apprehension of the siege did not fail to bring. This so to say moral tone to the rendering of the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>) is much to be preferred to that of the margin, "in <span class="accented">the fortress</span> or <span class="accented">stronghold</span>."

The rumour of the approach of "Tirhakah King of Ethiopia" (ver. 9) quickened Sennacherib's anxiety to make short work with the conflict at Jerusalem, by intimidating the people to an early collapse of their resistance,.

Stating, on the other hand, in mere historic dry detail, the return of Sennacherib to his own land, his dwelling at Nineveh, and assassination, in the house of Nisroch "his god," at the hands of his own two sons, mentioned by name Adrammelech and Sharezer, who had to fly for it to Armenia (<span class="accented">Ararat</span>), it does not show the obviously designed moral touch of our compiler, <span class="cmt_word">so he returned with shame of face to his own</span> <span class="cmt_word">land,</span> nor the similarly complexioned description of the time, place, and agents of his assassination.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-26.htm">2 Chronicles 32:26</a></div><div class="verse">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, <i>both</i> he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah humbled himself</span>. Possibly the language of the nineteenth verse in the parallel is the one surviving historic trace of this. The language found in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-19.htm">Jeremiah 26:19</a> may be also a note of the same, though its dependence (see vers. 17, 18) on <a href="../../par/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> seems to make it less likely. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a></div><div class="verse">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - If Hezekiah not only began to negotiate, but actually paid the precious metals, etc., with which he offered to buy off the invasion of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>), he may have become considerably recouped by the presents and gifts subsequently, liberally it would appear, brought to him (see our ver. 23), and it is possible that this may give us some further clue to where it was that his heart strayed, while displaying his wealth and treasures to the messengers of Berodach-Baladan King of Babylon.

What Hezekiah "stopped" was the spring, or more strictly access to it, and guided its prized waters down, probably by an underground channel, to Siloam, or else to the pool in the city which he had constructed and enclosed by that "another wall without" (ver. 5), west of the "city of David."
