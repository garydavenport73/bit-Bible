See the parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>, which verse, however, in a sense, disappoints us; for, beginning with these same words, it does not go on at all to tell of this second occurrence of the fire and the cloud and the glory. <span class="cmt_word">The fire came... and consumed the burnt offering and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sacrifices.</span> So <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>, when the tabernacle was consecrated. The closing verses of our ch. 5, compared with the first verse of ch. 6, and in particular the first word of that verse, "<span class="accented">then</span>," leave it quite open to conjecture that the demonstration of the fire and the glory of the Lord had not ceased, but was continued during the prayer of Solomon, though at its close they may have been marked with added brightness, and then wrought their sacrifice-consuming work. Such supposition may bring us nearest to some tenable explanation of what otherwise seems the very unaccountable omission in the parallel. The language of our ver. 2 adds something to countenance this theory, coinciding as it does with the language of the last verses of ch. 5.

Let it be noticed that in both these verses the compiler of Chronicles avoids the words, "all Israel," and "all the children of Israel;" in favour of <span class="cmt_word">all the people</span>. The parallel tells us that the <span class="cmt_word">sacrifices</span> in part were <span class="accented">peace offerings</span>, eatable, therefore, by priests and people. Large as the numbers of the <span class="cmt_word">oxen and sheep</span> sacrificed, yet indications in the narrative round about do something to sustain them, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the number of people who had come together; the fact that all the people are said to offer sacrifices; the fact that Solomon, Because of the press for room (ver. 7), hallowed the <span class="cmt_word">middle of the court</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably the court itself, in order to find place for the "burnt offerings, meat offerings, and fat" (ver. 7); further, the number of mouths of people that certainly would need filling, not only on one day, but on days more than one, while on the third day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-6.htm">Leviticus 19:6</a>) any part of a peace offering still left was to be destroyed by fire. Nevertheless, the thought of the scene of butchery is, to our modern imagination, amazing to the last degree. An assemblage of people in Jerusalem, all making also for its temple, of a hundred and twenty thousand people, and a minimum of another twenty-two thousand people, is startling; but add to these a <span class="cmt_word">sheep</span> apiece for the former number, and an <span class="cmt_word">ox</span> apiece for the latter (a computation itself necessarily under the mark), and allow several days to be covered by the- killing and sacrificing, and one feels that the key and explanation of the present words of the Bible text in this very passage are scarcely in hand. The interesting note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a> scarcely assists us. Its instances of the "profusion" of the "sacrifices of antiquity" are altogether and immensely distanced by the narrative before us, not only in the number of victims, but in respect of the time in which the victims had to be despatched and disposed of, and the place and space within which, if not the slaughtering, yet certainly the offering, had to be done.

The word thus translated in the Authorized Version occurs (including both its but very slightly differing forms) eleven times. Five of these times the margin offers, probably unnecessarily, the optional rendering of "restraint." It may be that the root involves this idea, and certainly the word is especially used for the seventh or closing day of Passover, and eighth or closing day of Tabernacles; but other occasions of its use seem to negative this as an essential element in the signification or essential condition of the use of the word; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Proclaim a solemn assembly" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>); "Call a solemn assembly" (<a href="../../par/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>).

The expressions that we have in this verse guide us amid some ambiguities to the correct date of the consecration of the temple. The verse purports to speak of the final completion the temple and the king's house or palace, with all whatsoever that was necessary to them in the matter of their furnishing. And, to say the least, the impression naturally produced on the reader is that they are spoken of as being <span class="accented">thus</span> completed simultaneously, although, beyond doubt, there was a sense in which the temple was (not utterly finished but) built long before the palace. Accordingly, when the next verse tells us of God's answer vouchsafed to the dedication prayer of Solomon, we <span class="cmt_word">are</span> not driven to the supposition that several years had elapsed since the final completion of the temple and the dedication of it on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, a similar interval lost between the dedication prayer and the Divine acknowledgment of it. It may be again stated that the main structure of the temple (not including courts, pillars, furnishing, vessels, etc.) was built after seven years' process, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, but the palace only after another complete twelve years (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), in Solomon's twenty-fourth year. A liberal study of the parallel narrative of Kings in its entirety strengthens considerably this view, inasmuch as there the whole account of the palace-building finds its place previous to the account of the dedicating of the temple. However, though there can be little practical doubt as to how the facts of the case stood and stand, yet this occasion must count one to be added to the chronological memorabilia of Scripture, in that, while both the accounts to which we have access leave very vague the very things we should naturally expect to have been stated concisely, they also both seem entirely unconscious of it - a directest outcome of the fact that both writers were but picking their own way in the midst of borrowed material, neither of them the original historian.

Although we can scarcely trace the principle of their selection from the seven parts of the prayer, they would seem to have been selected from the original work, as samples of a reply which presumably embraced reference to <span class="accented">all</span> the seven. When, in ver. 14, it is said, <span class="cmt_word">I will heal their land</span>, the telling expression, according to the Authorized Version, must be understood to refer to the removing of drought by rain. On the other hand, the Authorized Version is, in ver. 15, unfortunate in the unnecessary and misleading insertion of the <span class="accented">italics</span> found there, and in the use of the preposition "in" for <span class="accented">of</span>, the simple case <span class="accented">construct</span>, which is manifestly what is wanted and intended.

Much mercy, much forbearing, long-suffering, and slowness to anger, were sure to mark the Divine rule; nor would condemnation take effect, nor <span class="accented">did</span> it take effect, till the revolt of the people was a thorough revolt, as finally testifying itself in the crucifixion of Christ (see also, as comments on the <span class="accented">expressions</span> of these two verses, <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, and generally 15-64).
