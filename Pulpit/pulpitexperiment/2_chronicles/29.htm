So that, if these numbers be correct, and the numbers of our verse correct, Hezekiah must have been born when his father was only <span class="accented">eleven</span> years old. Of which all that can be said is, with Keil, that such a thing was not impossible and not unknown.

The parallel spells this name "Abi," omitting the final he, and dagesh in <span class="accented">yod. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Zechariah</span>. This may, perhaps, have been the Zechariah whose name accompanies the mention of the name of "Uriah the priest" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>, where we may be surprised to find Uriah called a "faithful witness," when we remember his associations with Ahaz, as told in our foregoing chapter.

This word, rendered here "street," occurs forty-two times, and is always rendered by the same English word, except three times, when it appears as "broad places," or "ways." Probably it should always be translated thus, its meaning and its manifest preponderant use being "an open space" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a>).

This word occurs twenty-seven times, and is rendered "separation" fifteen times, "flowers" twice, "put apart" three times, "uncleanness" or "filthiness" six times, and "menstruous" once. The term, therefore, is among the strongest that could be used, and glances probably at the abominations, of whatsoever sort, that Ahaz's idolatries had entailed (comp. ver. 16).

Some think (as, for instance, Canon Rawlinson) that they were sin offering, as the account of the offering of them (ver. 22) takes priority for them over the he-goats; others (as Bertheau, Professor J. G. Murphy, etc.), that they were certainly burnt offering. It scarcely appears as though much stress can be laid upon what is apparently the chief reason of Canon Rawlinson's opinion, in face of the immediate language of the last sentence of our ver. 24, "for the king commended the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel." The fact of no mention of burnt offering in our present verse, and of the natural construction of the description, "for a sin offering for the kingdom," etc., as applying to <span class="accented">all</span> that had preceded, seems the better argument, and all that is necessary, unless something moderately decisive be forthcoming to rebut it. The solution of all, however, is probably to our hand in <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, which is a very close and significant parallel to our present verse. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, or "young bullocks" is found in <a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and afterwards in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, etc.; Leviticus 8:2, 14, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="../../par/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; and, after, <a href="../../par/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18, 19-21</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2, 22</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifices of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-7</a>, and, after, <a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is the present passage; and, after, <a href="../../par/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>.

We are so distinctly twice told that these sacrifices were for all Israel, that it may be taken for granted that the desire of Hezekiah was to include the northern kingdom - with which, under Hoshea, in subjection to the Assyrian king, times were now very hard and ominous of the end - in the benefits of the expiatory offerings now made (so see vers. 5, 6, 10-12 of next chapter).

The simple tale of this verse speaks volumes of the state of the ecclesiastical profession and of the ecclesiastical heart at this very time.
