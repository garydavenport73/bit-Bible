Order of the divinest kind, discipline of the most perfect sort, are the glory of the temple and temple service of old, of the Church, her ministers, her members, and all her pious work of more modern date.

Hezekiah's object was to send impulses of energy through the whole nation.

It is not certain, however, that the word did not cover other sweet preparations, as probably in <a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>. The alternative reading, "dates," has thus come into the margin, but on very insufficient title, as, while there is doubt as to whether the honey of bees was generally tithed, there is none at all that the people's pious zeal might prompt them to bring tithe of it <span class="accented">voluntarily</span>, among other things, that they at any time held in honour and had in abundance.

Their <span class="cmt_word">tithes</span> <span class="cmt_word">of holy things</span> probably denote the "heave offerings" of Aaron (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>; for other references to the matter of this verse, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>).

He thus treats both vers. 16 and 17 as parenthetical. It seems quite as probable that the "to give" should be shown before ver. 17 as well as ver. 18.
