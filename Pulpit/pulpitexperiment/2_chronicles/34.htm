The parallel describes it, in more general terms, as "repairing the breaches." The repairs here spoken of, however, betoken, to say the least the rough usage, as well as "negligence," of kings like Manasseh and Amen, and suggest a further question as to the nature of those heathen and idolatrous practices, which cost so much to the very structure of temple and houses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably the contiguous chambers of the main building (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>), the exact style of which, however, is very doubtful.

The mention of the "scribe" in the singular number is of frequent occurrence in the historic books, and in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-22.htm">Isaiah 36:22</a>).

The word "quenched," which immediately follows, suits the word "kindled," and what with the testimony of the Septuagint, both here and in ver. 21, and the Hebrew in both passages of the parallel, suggests that "poured" is the substitution, by some mishap, of a copyist - a mishap, for instance, that might result from the copyist writing from the speech of some one, and not from his own inspection. Exactly similar mistakes may often be seen in our maps, where the spelling and misspelling of the name of some place seem only to be accounted for by the same supposition. The catastrophe now foretold befell the nation manifestly in the reigns of the succeeding sovereigns, whose days were emphatically both few and evil, viz. the two sons of Josiah, Jehoahaz and Eliakim, whose name was changed to Jehoiakim; and the two sons of this latter, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah (according to <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>, the same with <span class="accented">Mattaniah</span>, and son of <span class="accented">Josiah</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-26.htm">2 Chronicles 34:26</a></div><div class="verse">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel <i>concerning</i> the words which thou hast heard;</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a></div><div class="verse">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard <i>thee</i> also, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm">

So they brought the king word again.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-29.htm">2 Chronicles 34:29</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The wise, religious, and unselfish conduct of the king is clearly betokened in the course he took, as narrated here and in the succeeding three verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-30.htm">2 Chronicles 34:30</a></div><div class="verse">And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Levites</span>. The parallel mentions "prophets" and omits "Levites," which latter our compiler is safe not to forget. When it is said in this verse, he read, the meaning, of course, is "the priests" read (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-31.htm">2 Chronicles 34:31</a></div><div class="verse">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king stood in his place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not simply]in his order, but upon his royal pedestal, or platform; possibly following a mere suggestion, originating with the word used in the parallel, "by his pillar" (so Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-32.htm">2 Chronicles 34:32</a></div><div class="verse">And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand <i>to it</i>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - Some think the text here corrupt, both for the presence of the words, and in <span class="cmt_word">Benjamin</span>, and the absence of the words, "in the covenant." Their case, however, is scarcely conclusive (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>).
