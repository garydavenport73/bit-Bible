The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>) says more distinctly, "The house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin." They of Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-16.htm">2 Chronicles 10:16</a>) had flung it at Judah: "Now, David, see to thine own house." Rehoboam, of course, does this very thing. For the first <span class="accented">time,formally, Benjamin</span> is now introduced as throwing in its lot with Judah, and the acted prophecy of Ahijah is seen fulfilled; the chiefest of the tribes, and the tribe that came of the youngest and most petted of old Jacob's sons, are now wedded to the end. The tribe of Benjamin lay hemmed in between Ephraim, to which it had once much leaned, and to which (as Benjamin was the blood-uncle of Ephraim) it was more closely related, and Judah, with which it had once been at variance (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-32</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>). But exactly on the border-line of Judah and Benjamin rose the city Jerusalem and the temple (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>); and, beyond doubt, this fact had helped to bring about the much more friendly feeling, if not absolutely close union, that now for some time had existed between these two tribes in their contiguous allotments. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred and four-score thousand chosen men,</span> <span class="cmt_word">which were warriors.</span> According to Joab, in David's time the men able to bear arms of Judah alone were five hundred thousand (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>). Compare the numbers in the next reign (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>), and, later on still, in Jehoshaphat's (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>). Both of these show that Abijah and Jehoshaphat respectively had improved the time given to training much larger armies, whereas now Rehoboam was taken by surprise.

The second is found in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5, 7</a>, on occasion of the invasion of Judah and Jerusalem by Shishak King of Egypt; and the third, in the same chapter, ver. 15, that he wrote a book respecting the acts of Rehoboam. The expression, "man of God," owns to a somewhat unexplained history. It is first found in the added part of Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), where it is applied to Moses. It occurs once in Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>); twice in Judges (<a href="../../par/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6, 8</a>); four times in Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>); <span class="accented">twenty-nine</span> times in Kings; six times in Chronicles; once each in Ezra, Nehemiah and Jeremiah.

When we consider the mention of Rehoboam personally in the former clause of the verse, it would seem most probable that the meaning is all the people of the nation, resident in the Judah and Benjamin allotments, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nation called collectively Israel. This will include "the remnant" spoken of in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-23.htm">1 Kings 12:23</a>, compared with 17).

They and theirs will have, long as life lasts, as lives last, to go through the baptism of bitter suffering, and leave a heritage of the same for others.

He builds fifteen "fenced cities," or "cities for defence," twelve of them south and west of Jerusalem, for lear of Egypt; he fortifies certain strongholds, officering them, provisioning them, and supplying to them and "every several city" the necessary weapons of warfare and shields.

Bethlehem, originally Ephrath (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a>), was one of the very oldest towns existent in Jacob's time.

The sad knell is sounded all too soon; see first verso of next chapter. Three years' strength will soon become weakness, and three years' goodness will save no soul. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-18.htm">2 Chronicles 11:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, <i>and</i> Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The 'Speaker's Commentary' opportunely  suggests the probability that we may be indebted here to Iddo's "genealogies" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>). The word <span class="cmt_word">daughter</span> here is a correction of the Keri, the Chethiv having been "son," This <span class="cmt_word">Jerimoth</span> is the seventh out of a list of eight men of the same name mentioned in the two books of Chronicles. He is not given as one of the children of David's proper wives in either <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-8</a> or 1 Chronicles 14:4-7; Jerome says it was the Jewish tradition that he was the son of a concubine of David. It is just possible that Jerimoth and Ithream were two names of the same person. <span class="cmt_word">Abihail</span> was second cousin of Mahalath. It is not quite clear whether Abihail were wife of Jerimoth and mother of Mahalath, or a second wife now mentioned of Rehoboam. The contents of the next verse not differencing the children there mentioned, and assigning her own to each wife of Rehoboam, if these were two wives of his, favours the former supposition (our Hebrew text being "and she <span class="accented">bare</span>," not "which bare"). When it is said that Abthail was the daughter of <span class="cmt_word">Eliab</span>, the meaning probably is, as again in ver. 20, granddaughter. (For Eliab, see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-19.htm">2 Chronicles 11:19</a></div><div class="verse">Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - (See last note.) If previous verse speaks of two wives of Rehoboam, of which wife (our Hebrew text being not "which bare," but "and she bare") were <span class="cmt_word">Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham</span> the children? or of which respectively, if they express the children of both? As the words now stand, it can only be supposed, with all lexicons, that Abihail is mother of the three children on the two-wife supposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Maachah was the granddaughter of Absalom by his daughter Tamar, wife of Uriel (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>).

Rehoboam again offends against the "Law" (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>). He cannot justly plead as a precedent the instance of David and Solomon, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>; for this was only justified by the express Divine ordinance, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>.

Rather his <span class="accented">wise</span> <span class="accented">dealing is</span> an indication that his conscience was not quite at ease, and that he knew he was wrong.
