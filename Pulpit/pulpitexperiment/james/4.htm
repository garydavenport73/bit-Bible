In behalf of its secondary meaning, "contention," Grimm ('Lexicon of New Testament Greek') appeals to Sophocles, 'Electra,' 1. 219, and Plato, 'Phaed.,' p. 66, c.

There is then no need to seek an explanation of the passage in the outbreaks and insurrections which were so painfully common among the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Lusts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); R.V., "pleasures." "An unusual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, hardly distinguishable from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in fact taken up by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Alford). With the expression, "that war in your members," comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, "<span class="accented">Abstain</span> from fleshly lusts which war against the soul." Ver. <span class="cmt_sub_title">2 gives us an insight into the terrible difficulties with which the apostles</span> had to contend. Those to whom St. James was writing were guilty of lust, which actually led to murder. So the charge in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a> evidently presupposes the possibility of a professing Christian suffering as a murderer or thief. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill</span>. The marginal rendering "<span class="accented">envy"</span> supplies a remarkable instance of a false reading once widely adopted, although resting simply on conjecture. There is no variation in the manuscripts or ancient versions. All alike have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But, owing to the startling character of the expression in an address to Christians, Erasmus suggested that perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye envy," was the original reading, and actually inserted it in the second edition of his Greek Testament (1519). In his third edition (1522) he wisely returned to the true reading, although, strangely enough, he retained the false one, "<span class="accented">invidetis</span>," in his Latin version, whence it passed into that of Beza and others. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> appears, however, in a few later editions, e.g. three editions published at Basle, 1524 (Bebelius), 1546 (Herwagius), and 1553 (Beyling), in that of Henry Stephens, 1576; and even so late as 1705 is found in an edition of Oritius. In England the reading obtained a wide currency, being actually adopted in all the versions in general use previous to that of 1611, viz. those of Tyndale, Coverdale, Taverner, the Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Version. The Authorized Version relegated it to the margin, from which it has been happily excluded by the Revisers, and thus, it is to be hoped, it has finally disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill, and desire to have.</span> The combination is certainly strange. Dean Scott sees in the terms a possible allusion to "the well-known politico-religious party of the zealots," and <span class="accented">suggests</span> the rendering, "<span class="accented">ye</span> play the murderers and zealots." It is, perhaps, more probable that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> simply refers to covetousness; cf. the use of the word (although with a better meaning) in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>.

And yet St. James says, "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss;" for our Lord elsewhere limits his teaching, "<span class="accented">All</span> things whatsoever ye shall ask <span class="accented">in prayer believing</span>," etc. (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-22.htm">Matthew 21:22</a>). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. The active and middle voices are similarly interchanged in <a href="../../par/1_john/5-15.htm">1 John 5:15</a>, on which Dr. Westcott writes as follows: "The distinction between the middle and the active is not so sharply drawn; but generally the personal reference is suggested by the middle, while the request is left wholly undefined as to its destination by the active." <span class="cmt_word">That ye may consume it upon your lusts</span>; render, with R.V., <span class="accented">that ye may spend it in your pleasures</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, as in ver. 1.

Very strange is this sudden exclamation, "<span class="accented">ye</span> adulteresses!" and very difficult to explain. The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is used as a feminine adjective by our Lord in the expression, "<span class="accented">an</span> evil and adulterous generation" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>); and in this possibly lies the explanation of St. James's use of the term. More probably, however, it should be accounted for as a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>, where we read of Samaria and Jerusalem under the titles of Aholah and Aholibah: "The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; <span class="accented">because they are adulteresses</span>, and blood is in their <span class="accented">hands."</span> It is remarkable too that in <a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, although the Hebrew has the masculine, and <span class="accented">men</span> are evidently referred to. If, then, in the Old Testament the Jewish communities were personified as adulteresses, it is not unnatural for St. James to transfer the epithet to those Judaeo-Christian communities to which he was writing; and the word should probably be taken, just as in the Old Testament, of spiritual fornication, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apostasy from God, shown in this case, not by actual idolatry, but by that "<span class="accented">friendship</span> of the world" which is "enmity with God," and by "<span class="accented">covetous</span>ness which is idolatry." <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The word occurs here only in the New Testament. With the thought of this verse, compare our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18, 19</a>.

With regard to the first clause, the rendering of the R.V., "speaketh," may be justified by <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>. It is possible that St. James was intending to quote <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> immediately, but after the introductory formula, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, he interposes with the emphatic question, "Is it to <span class="accented">envy</span>," etc.? and does not arrive at the quotation till ver. 6, when he introduces it with a fresh formula of quotation, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, a looseness of construction which is quite natural in a Hebrew. Other views, for which it is believed there is less to be urged, are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., are a quotation from some (now lost) early Christian writing. On this view the passage is parallel to <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, where a portion of a Christian hymn is introduced by the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That St. James is referring to the general drift rather than to the exact words of several passages of the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10, 19</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That the allusion is to some passage of the New Testament, either <a href="../../par/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a> or <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. Passing on to the translation of the second clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., it must be noted that <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is never used elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. (Wisd. 6:25; 1 Macc. 8:16) or in the apostolic Fathers except in a bad sense. True that <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> teaches us that God is a "<span class="accented">jealous God</span>," but there the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span> by the far nobler word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. Wolf, 'Curae Philippians Crit.,' p. 64, where it is noted that, while <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="accented">a vex media</span>, the same cannot be said of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is always <span class="accented">vitiosa</span>, and is never used by the LXX. <span class="accented">ubi vox Hebraica</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5ea;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5e6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5da;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> This seems to be a fatal objection to the marginal readings of the Revised Version, and to compel us to rest content with that adopted in the text, "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?" or rather, "Is it to <span class="accented">envying</span> that the Spirit...  longs?" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being placed for emphasis at the beginning of the sentence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">But he giveth more grace.

The quotation is from <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. St. James's version agrees with this exactly, except that it has <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the Hebrew has simply "he," ran). The passage is also quoted in precisely the same form by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>), and with <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Clement of Rome. In St. Peter the quotation is followed by the injunction, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God .... Your adversary <span class="accented">the devil</span>, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: <span class="accented">whom withstand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) steadfast in the faith." There is clearly a connection between this passage and the one before us in St. James, which proceeds, "Be subject therefore unto God; but <span class="accented">resist the devil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>), and he will flee from you." This passage, it will be felt, is the simpler, and therefore, probably, the earlier of the two (cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a>).
