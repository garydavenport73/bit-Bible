The prophet (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>). This title, which is added in the inscriptions only to the names of Haggai and Zechariah, and cursorily to that of Jeremiah (46, 47, 50.), implies that he exercised the practical office of prophet, and was well known; and, as Pusey thinks, Habakkuk appended it here on account of the form in which his prophecy is cast, as being addressed almost entirely to God or the Chaldeans, not to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">Did see.</span> In prophetic vision (see note on Amos 1:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The prophet complains to God of the iniquity of his own nation, and its consequence.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I cry;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Hebrew is taken to imply that the prophet had long been complaining of the moral depravity of Judah, and calling for help against it There is no reference here, as Ewald fancies, to acts of violence committed by the Chaldeans, who, in fact, are announced as coming to chastise the wickedness of the chosen people (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And thou wilt not hear!</span> The continuance of evil unchecked is an anomaly in the prophet's eye; and, putting himself in the position of the righteous among the people, he asks how long this is to last. <span class="cmt_word">Even cry out unto thee of violence;</span> better, <span class="accented">I cry out unto thee, Violence</span>. A similar construction is found in <a href="../../par/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>. "Violence" includes all manner of wrong done to one's neighbour.

So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vociferabor ad te vim patiens.</span> But Habakkuk doubtless speaks in the person of the righteous, grieved at the wickedness he sees around, and the more perplexed as the Law led him to look for temporal rewards and punishments, if in the case of individuals, much more in that of the chosen nation (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>).

The LXX. and the Vulgate translate the word <span class="accented">amal</span> "trouble," or "labour;" Keil, "distress." In this case it means the trouble and distress which a man inflicts on others, as wrong doing seems to be generally spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Spoiling and violence are before me.</span> "Spoiling" is robbery that causes desolation. "Violence" is conduct that wrongs one's neighbour. The two words are often joined; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>.

Septuagint, "Against me judgment hath gone, and the judge receiveth bribes." So the Syriac and Arabic. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Factum est judicium, et contradictio potentior</span>, where <span class="accented">judicium</span> is used in a bad sense.

I will use a heathen nation, he says, as my instrument to chastise the sinners in Judaea; and you shall see that I have not disregarded the evil that is rife among you. Some commentators suppose that the impious are addressed; but Habakkuk spoke in the name and person of the righteous, and to them the answer must be directed.

St. Paul quotes the Greek Version, <a href="../../par/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, in his sermon at Antioch in the Jewish synagogue, warning those who despised the gospel This was sufficiently close to the Hebrew for his purpose. <span class="cmt_word">And regard, and wonder marvellously.</span> They are to wonder because the work is as terrible as it is unexpected.

The Vulgate, too, gives, <span class="accented">facies eorum ventus urens</span>, which Jerome explains, "As at the blast of a burning wind all green things dry up, so at the sight of these men all shall be wasted." This is the meaning of the Anglican Version, which, however, might be improved thus: <span class="accented">The aspect of their faces is as the east wind.</span> The Revisers have, <span class="accented">Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind</span>, which does not seem very intelligible.

The former interpretation regards what is coming, the latter keeps to the metaphor of the wind. <span class="cmt_word">And offend.</span> He is guilty, or offends, as the next clause explains, by attributing his success to his own prowess and skill. Thus the prophet intimates that the avenger himself incurs God's displeasure, and will suffer for it. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which St. Cyril interprets to mean that the Lord will change his purpose of punishing the Jews, and will have mercy on them - a notion quite foreign to the purport of the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">Imputing this his power unto his god;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">this his power is his god</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">even he whose might is his god</span>. He defies the Lord, and makes his might his god. (For such pride and self-glorification, setup. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>.)

An affirmative answer is expected. This is one ground of confidence in the corrective nature of the chastisement. God is Jehovah, the covenant God, who has been in personal  relation to Israel from time immemorial, and is himself eternal. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Holy One</span>. He speaks in the person of the righteous people, and he refers to God's holiness as a second ground of hope, because, although God must punish sin, he will not let the sacred nation, the chosen guardian of the faith, perish utterly. And then he expresses this confidence: <span class="cmt_word">We shall not die.</span> We shall be chastened, but not killed. The Masorites assert that the present reading is a correction of the scribes for "thou wilt not die," which the prophet wrote originally, and which was altered for reverence' sake. But this is a mere assumption, incapable of proof. Its adoption would be an omission of the very consolation to which the prophet's confidence leads. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ordained them</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for judgment.</span> Thou hast appointed the Chaldean to execute thy corrective punishment on Israel (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>).

Thou appointedst the Chaldean, or madest him strong, in order to correct thy people. He is, like the Assyrian, the rod of God's anger (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).

This, says St. Jerome, is spoken in the person of the prophet announcing his call and office.

Injustice and the distress occasioned by it. God's holiness cannot endure the sight of wickedness, nor his mercy the sight of man's misery. And yet he permits these evil men to afflict the holy seed. This is the prophet's perplexity, which he lays before the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Them that deal treacherously.</span> The Chaldeans, so called from their faithless and rapacious conduct (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">More righteous.</span> The Israelites, wicked as they were, were more righteous than the Chaldeans (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-51.htm">Ezekiel 16:51</a>, etc.).

So the Jews seem to be deprived of God's care, and left to be the prey of the spoiler, as if of little worth, and no longer having God for their King (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>, Revised Version). The "creeping things" are worms, or small fish (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>).

There is no trace in the monuments of the Chaldeans paying divine honours to their weapons, as, accord-lug to Herodotus (4:62), the Scythians and other nations did (see Justin, 'Hist.,' 43:3; and Pusey's note here).

The question is answered in the next chapter, where the judgment on the Chaldeans is pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">And not spare continually to slay the nations?</span> And cease not to send forth his armies and to found his empire in the blood of conquered nations.
