This can only import that, on reaching the north outer gate, the prophet and his guide turned eastward and moved round to the east outer gate. The Revised Version reads, by the way of the gate that <span class="accented">looketh toward the east</span>; but as the east outer gate was the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the prophet's walk, it is better to translate, to the gate <span class="accented">looking eastward</span>.

Smend changes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.

The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> was applied either to a river that constantly flowed from a fountain, as the Amen, or to a winter torrent that springs up from rain or snow upon the mountains, and disappears in summer like the Kedron, which had seldom any water in it (see Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 1:402). That Ezekiel's river broadened and deepened so suddenly, and apparently without receiving into it any tributaries, clearly pointed to miraculous action. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen <i>this</i>? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he... caused me to return to the brink of the river</span>. The difficulty lying in the word "return" has given rise to a variety of conjectures. Hengstenberg supposes the prophet had made trial of the river's depth by wading in (perhaps up to the neck), and that the angel caused him to return from the stream to the bank According to Hitzig, the measuring had taken place at some distance from the stream, and the prophet, having come up to his guide from the bank after making trial of the water's depth, was Once more conducted back to the river's brink. Havernick conceives the sense to be that the prophet, having accompanied the angel to the point where the stream debouched into the Dead Sea was led back to the riverbank. All difficulty, however, vanishes if, either with Schroder we refer <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> to a mental returning, as if the import were that the angel, having ascertained that the prophet had "seen" the river's course, now told him to direct his attention to the bank, or, with Keil and Kliefoth, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> by "along" or "on" rather than "to." As the prophet had been led along or on the river's bank to see the increasing breadth and depth of the water, so was he now "caused to return" along or on the same bank to note the abundance of the foliage with which it was adorned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a></div><div class="verse">Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river <i>were</i> very many trees on the one side and on the other.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when I had returned</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is by the best interpreters, after Gesenius ('Hebrew Grammar,' &sect; 132. 2), regarded as an incorrect form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in my returning</span>), though Schroder adheres to the transitive sense of the verb, and translates," when I had turned myself," and Hitzig takes the suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as a genitive of possession, and renders, "when he came back with me." In any case, on the return journey the prophet observed that at (or, on) <span class="cmt_word">the bank</span> (or, <span class="accented">lip</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> Hitzig supposes the trees had not been there when the prophet made the down journey, but sprang up when he had turned to his guide (ver. 6), and stood with his back to the river. Kliefoth's conclusion is better, that the trees had been there all the while, but that the prophet's attention had not been directed to them. The luxuriant foliage of this vision reappears in that of the Apocalyptic river (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).

The Arabah signified the low, sterile valley into which the Jordan runs near Jericho, in which are the Dead Sea (hence called "the sea of the Arabah," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>), and the brook Kedron, or "river of the Arabah" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>), and which extends as far south as the head of the Elanitic gulf. The whole region is described by Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:596) as one of extreme desolation - a character which belonged to it in ancient times (Josephus, 'Wars,' 3:10. 7; 4:8. 2). The part of this Arabah into which the waters flowed was situated north of <span class="cmt_word">the sea</span>, clearly not the Mediterranean, but the Dead Sea, "the sea of the Arabah," as above stated, and the "eastern sea" as afterwards named (ver. 18), into which they ultimately flowed. The clause, which being <span class="cmt_word">brought forth into the sea</span>, may either be connected with the proceeding words or formed into an independent sentence. Among those who adopt the former construction a variety of renderings prevails. The LXX. reads, "(And the water) comes to the sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), to the sea of the pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Dead Sea, into which the river debouches. With this Havernick agrees, rendering, "to the sea of that outflow." Ewald reads, "into the sea of muddy waters," meaning the Dead Sea. Kimchi, "into the sea where the waters are brought forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ocean (the Mediterranean), whoso waters go forth to encompass the world. Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, who adopt the latter construction, borrow <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> from the antecedent clause, and translate, "To the sea (come or go) the waters that have been brought forth;" with which accords the Revised Version. The last words record the effect which should be produced by their entering into the sea. <span class="cmt_word">The waters shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered salubrious, from being hurtful (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). The translation of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is inaccurate. The unwholesome character of the Dead Sea is described by Tacitus: "Lucius <span class="accented">immenso ambitu</span>, <span class="accented">specie maris sapore corruptior</span>, <span class="accented">gravitate odoris accolis pestifer</span>, <span class="accented">neque vento impellitar neque pisces ant suetas aquis volucres patitur"</span> ('Hist.,' 5:6). Yon Raumer (p. 61) writes, "The sea is celled Dead, because there is in it no green plant, no water-fowl in it, no fish, no shell. If the Jordan carry fish into it, they die." "According to the testimony of all antiquity and of most modern travelers," says Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), "there exists within the waters of the Dead Sea no living thing, no trace, indeed, of animal or vegetable life. Our own experience goes to confirm the truth of this testimony. We perceived no sign of life within the waters." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The nature of the healing is next described as an impartation of such celebrity to the waters that <span class="cmt_word">everything that liveth, which moveth</span> - better, <span class="accented">every</span> <span class="accented">living creature which swarmeth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">whitherseover the rivers</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the two rivers</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall come, shall live</span>. The meaning cannot be that everything which liveth and swarmeth in the sea whither the rivers come shall live, because the Dead Sea contains no fish (see above), but whithersoever the rivers come, there living and swarming creatures of every kind shall spring into existence, shall come to life and flourish. The dual form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, has been accounted for by Maurer, as having been selected on account of its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>; by H&auml;vernick and Currey, as pointing to the junction of another river, the Kedron (H&auml;vernick), the Jordan (Currey), with the temple-stream before the latter, should fall into the sea; by Kliefoth, as alluding to a division of the river waters after entering the sea; by Neumann and Schroder, as referring to the waters of the sea and the waters of the river, which should henceforth be united; and by Hengstenberg, with whom Keil and Plumptre agree, as a dual of intensification (as in Jeremiah 1:21), signifying "double river," with allusion to its greatness, or the strength of its current. None of these interpretations is free from objection; though probably, in default of better, the last is best. Ewald changes the dual into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, a singular with a suffix, while Hitzig makes of it a plural; but neither of these devices is satisfactory. As a further evidence that the waters of the sea should be healed by the inflowing into them of the waters of the river, it is stated that the sea should thereafter contain <span class="cmt_word">a very great multitude of fish</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and the fish will be very many</span>), of which previously it contained none. The next clauses supply the reason of this abundance of fish, <span class="cmt_word">because these waters</span> (of the river) <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> - or, <span class="accented">are</span> (Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">come thither</span>  - (into the waters of the sea), <span class="cmt_word">for</span> (literally, and) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they</span>, the latter, <span class="cmt_word">shall be</span> (or, <span class="accented">are</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>healed, and everything shall live</span> (or, connecting this with the foregoing clause, <span class="accented">and everything shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">and live</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whithersoever the river cometh</span> - the river, namely, that proceedeth from the temple.

Res.,' 2:225). These, according to the prophet, should not be healed (better than, "and that which shall not be healed," as in the margin of the Authorized Text), obviously because the waters of the temple-river should not reach them, but should be <span class="cmt_word">given to salt</span>. When the waters of the above-mentioned pools have been dried up or evaporated, they leave behind them a deposit of salt (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), and Canon Driver ('Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 276), following Smend, conceives that the above-named miry places and marshes in the vicinity of the Dead Sea were to be allowed to remain as they were on account of the excellent salt which they furnished. (On the supposed (!) excellence of the salt derived from the Dead Sea, Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 616, may be consulted.) If this, however, were the correct import of the prophet's words, then the clause would describe an additional blessing to be enjoyed by the land, viz. that the temple-river would not be permitted to spoil its "salt-pans;" but the manifest intention of the prophet was to indicate a limitation to the life-giving influence of the river, and to signify that places and persons unvisited by its healing stream would be abandoned to incurable destruction. "To give to salt" is in Scripture never expressive of blessing, but always of judgment (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>).

Had the earlier principle of allotment been indicated as that to be followed in the future, it would not have been possible to give the tribes equal portions, as some tribes would certainly have a larger number of families than others. Nevertheless, the division was to be equal among the tribes, which shows it was rather of an ideal than of an actual distribution the prophet was speaking.

Originally colonized by the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), it became in David's time a flourishing kingdom under Toi, who formed an alliance with the Hebrew sore-reign against Hadadezer of Zoba (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-9.htm">1 Chronicles 18:9</a>). It was subsequently conquered by the King of Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>). Winer thinks it never belonged to Israel; but Schurer cites <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a> to show that at least in Solomon's reign it was temporarily annexed to the empire of David's son. In Ezekiel's chart the territory of united Israel should extend, not to the town of Hamath, but to the southern boundary of the land of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Berothah</span> was probably the same as Berothai (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>), afterwards called Chun (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>), if <span class="accented">Chun</span> is not a textual corruption.

Its high antiquity is testified by both Scripture (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-15.htm">Genesis 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>) and the cuneiform inscriptions, in which it appears as <span class="accented">Dimaski</span> and <span class="accented">Dimaska</span> (Schrader, ' Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament,' p. 138). <span class="cmt_word">Hazar-hatticon</span>; or, the <span class="accented">middle Hazar</span>, was probably so styled to distinguish it from Hazar-enan (ver. 17).

The word Hazar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "an enclosure," or "place fenced off," was employed to denote villages or townships, of which at least six are mentioned in Scripture (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Hauran</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), "Cave-land," so called because of the number of its caverns, was most likely designed to designate "the whole tract of land between Damascus and the country of Gilead" (Keil).

In any case, by this instruction, first the land of Israel was defined as the territory lying west of the Jordan, and secondly its boundary should extend from the last-named north border at its easternmost point, Hazar-enan, down the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea. The practical effect of this would be to cut off the lands which in the earlier division (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-14.htm">Numbers 34:14, 15</a>) had been assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Otherwise the boundary here given corresponds with that traced in Numbers, though the latter is more minute. Hengstenberg, however, thinks the prophet cannot have intended to assert that the new Israel should not possess the land of Gilead as a frontier in the future as formerly, as in that case he would have been at variance, not only with preexisting Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>), but with subsequent history.

But if the priest-code was later than Ezekiel, why should it have receded from the freer and more liberal spirit of Ezekiel? If progressive development can determine the relative ages of two documents, then Ezekiel, which accords equal rights to Jew and Gentile in the new Israel, and thus anticipates that breaking down of the middle wall of partition which has taken place under the gospel (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8-14, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>), should be posterior to the priest-code, which shows itself to be not yet emancipated from the trammels of Jewish exclusivism. At the same time, Ezekiel's Torah does not grant equal rights with native-born Israelites to "strangers" indiscriminately, or only to those of them who should have families, as Hitzig suggests, in reward for their increasing the population, but to such of them as should permanently settle in the midst of Israel, and show this by begetting children, and in this manner "building houses" for themselves. Kliefoth justly cautions against concluding from the prophet's statement that the time in which the prophet's vision realizes itself will necessarily be one in which marrying and begetting children will take place; and with equal justice points out that the number of Israel, especially when swelled up by an influx of Gentiles, will be so great (comp. ver. 10) as to render their settlement within the narrow boundaries of the land an impossibility - in this circumstance finding another indication that the prophet's language was intended to be symbolically, not literally, interpreted. <span class="cmt_word">NOTE</span>. <span class="accented">- On the boundaries of the land</span>. Smend thinks <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that in respect of the north boundary, Ezekiel and the priest-code contradict the older source of the Pentateuch, which does not permit the territory of Asher to extend so far north as Hamath (see <a href="../../par/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24-31</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that never at any time did Israelites dwell so far north as at the entering in of Hamath; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that this extension of the land northwards was intended as a compensation for the withdrawment of the territory east of the Jordan; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that in dividing among tribes rather than among families Ezekiel deviates from both the Jehovistic tradition and the priest-code.
