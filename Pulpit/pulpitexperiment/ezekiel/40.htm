As the last note of time was the twelfth year (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17</a>), it may be assumed the interval was largely occupied in receiving and delivering the prophecies that fall between those dates, though it is more than likely a period of silence preceded the vision of which this last section of the book preserves an account. If not the last of the prophet's utterances (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17</a>), it was beyond question the grandest and most momentous. Accordingly, the prophet notes with his customary exactness that the vision came to him <span class="cmt_word">in the beginning of the year</span>, which Hitzig, whom Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' follows, believes to have been a jubilee year, which began on the tenth day of the seventh month. As, however, the practice of commencing the year with this month was not introduced among the Jews till after the exile, and as Ezekiel everywhere follows the purely Mosaic arrangement of the year, the presumption is that the beginning of the year here alluded to was the month Abib, and that <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">tenth day of the month</span> was the day on which the Torah enjoined the selection of a lamb for the Passover. Indeed, the two clauses in Ezekiel read like an abbreviation of the Mosaic statute (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2, 3</a>) - a circumstance sufficiently striking and probably significant, though emphasis should not, with Hengstenberg, be laid upon the fact that every word in Ezekiel's copy is found in the Exodus original. On that day, which was the anniversary of the beginning of a merciful deliverance to Israel in Egypt, of the initial step in a gracious process of transforming Pharaoh's captives into a nation, - on that day (for emphasis <span class="cmt_word">the selfsame day</span>, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>), the prophet's soul was rapt into an ecstasy (see on Ezekiel 1:3), in which he seemed to be transported thither, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> towards the smitten city, and a disclosure made to him concerning that new community which Jehovah was about to form out of old Israel.

That this mountain, though resembling the temple hill in Jerusalem, was not that in reality, but "the mountain of the Lord's house" of Messianic times (see on Ezekiel 43:12; and comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>), may be inferred from its greater altitude than that of either Moriah or Zion, which pointed obviously to the loftier spiritual elevation of the new Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As the frame of a city on the south.</span> What Ezekiel beheld was not "beside" or "by" (Authorized Version), but "on" the mountain, and was not, as Havernick, Ewald, and Kliefoth suppose, the new city of Jerusalem, though this might with a fair measure of accuracy be described as lying south of Moriah on which the temple stood, but the temple itself, which, with its walls and gates, chambers and courts, rose majestically before the prophet's view, with all the magnificence, and indeed (as the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. indicates), with the external appearance of a city. That the prophet should speak of it as "on the south" receives sufficient explanation from the circumstance that he himself came from the north, and had it always before him in a southerly direction. The idea is correctly enough expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX., which signifies "over against" to one coming from the north.

In his hand he carried a line <span class="cmt_word">of flax and a measuring-reed</span> (<span class="accented">kaneh hammidah</span>, or "reed of measuring," reed having been the customary material out of which such rods were made; compare the Assyrian for a measuring-reed <span class="accented">qanu</span>, the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin canna). Possibly he carried these as "emblems of building activity" (Hengstenberg), and because "he had many and different things to measure" (Kliefoth); but most likely the line was meant to measure large dimensions (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>) and such as could not be taken by a straight stick, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the girth of pillars, and the rod to measure smaller dimensions, like those of the gates and walls of the temple. Hitzig's conjecture, that the line was linen because the place to be measured was the sanctuary, whose priests were obliged to clothe themselves in linen, Kliefoth rightly pronounces artificial and inaccurate, since the line was made, not of manufactured flax, or linen, but of the raw material. That the "man" was Jehovah or the Angel of the Presence (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>) the analogy of <a href="../../par/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7, 8</a> and the statement of Ezekiel in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2, 5</a> would seem to suggest; only it is not certain in the last of these passages that the speaker was "the man" and not rather "the God of Israel," who had already taken possession of the house (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>), and whose voice is once at least distinguished from that of the man (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>). Accordingly, Kliefoth, Smend, and others identify the "man" with the ordinary <span class="accented">angelus interpres</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">gate</span> in which he stood "waiting for the new comer" was manifestly the north gate, since Ezekiel came from the north, though Havernick and Smend put in a plea for the east gate, on the grounds that it was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, and the distance between it and the north gate, five hundred cubits, was too great to be passed over so slightly as in ver. 6.

The "wall" belonged to the outer court; that of the inner court being afterwards mentioned (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>). In having a "wall round about" Jehovah's sanctuary resembled both Greek and Babylonian shrines (see Herod., 1:18; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:126), but differed from both the tabernacle, which had none, and from the Solomonic temple, whose "wall" formed no essential part of the sacred structure, but was more or less of arbitrary erection on the part of Solomon and later kings. Here, however, the wall constituted an integral portion of the whole; and was designed, like that in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>, "to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place," as the Greeks distinguished between the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (see Thucyd., 4:95). Its breadth and height were the same (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>) - one reed, of <span class="cmt_word">six cubits by the cubit and an hand-breadth</span>; that is to say, each cubit measured an ordinary cubit and a hand-breadth (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>). Hengstenberg suggests that the greater cubit of Ezekiel was borrowed from the Chaldeans; and certainly Herodotus (1. 178) speaks of a royal cubit in Babylon which was three finger-breadths longer than the ordinary measure, while in Egypt also two such cubits of varying lengths were current (Bockhart, 'Metrol. Untersuch,' p. 212); "from which it might be supposed," says Smend, "that the same thing held good for Asia Minor." Still, the hypothesis is likelier that the cubit in question was the old Mosaic cubit - the cubit of a man (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>), equal to the length of the forearm  from the elbow to the end of the longest finger - which was employed in the building of the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>). Assuming the cubit to have been eighteen inches, the height and breadth of the wall would be nine feet - no great elevation, and presenting a striking contrast to the colossal proportions of city walls in Babylon and in Greece (see Herod., 1:170; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:127, 1st series), and even of the walls of the first temple in Jerusalem (see Josephus, 'Wars,' 5:1); but in this, perhaps, lay a special significance, since, as the city-like temple stood in no need of walls and bulwarks for defense, the lowness of its walls would permit it the more easily to be seen, would, in fact, make it a conspicuous object to all who might approach it for worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <i>which was</i> one reed broad; and the other threshold <i>of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">east gate</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The gate which looketh toward the east</span>; literally, <span class="accented">whose face was toward the east</span>. That this was not the gate in which the angel had been first observed standing seems implied in the statement that he came to it. That he began with it is satisfactorily accounted for by remembering that the east gate was the principal entrance, and stood directly in front of the porch of the temple proper. The same reasons will explain the fullness of description accorded to it rather than to the others. It was ascended by <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span>, or <span class="accented">steps</span>, of which the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is omitted, though it is mentioned in connection with the north (ver. 22) and south (ver. 26) gates. "The significance was obvious," writes Plumptre. "Men must ascend in heart and mind as they enter the sanctuary, and the seven steps represented the completeness at last of that ascension." The steps lay outside the wall, and at their head had a <span class="cmt_word">threshold</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, properly an "expansion," or "spreading out") <span class="cmt_word">one reed broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> measuring inwards from east to west, the thickness of the wall. Its extension from south to north, afterwards stated, was ten cubits, or fifteen feet (ver. 11).

These "lodges," or "cells," were intended for the Levite sentinels who kept guard over the house (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11, 14</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-11.htm">2 Chronicles 12:11</a>).

Hitzig, Ewald, and Smend have accordingly expunged it from the text - an altogether unnecessary proceeding. The seeming discrepancy may be removed by supposing either, with Kliefoth, that ver. 8 furnishes the measurement of the porch from east to west, and ver. 9 its measurement from north to south, with the measurements in addition of the <span class="cmt_word">posts</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, "a ram," hence anything curved or twisted), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pillars or jambs; or, with Keil, that ver. 8 states the depth from east to west, and ver. 9 the length from north to south.

Obviously this measurement was taken from north to south of the gate-entrance (ver. 6), and represented the whole breadth of the  doorway and the threshold, or one-fifth of the entire length of the gate-building. The second portion of the verse, <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gate thirteen cubits</span>, is explained by Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, Keil (with whom Plumptre agrees), as signifying the length of the covered way from the east entrance, since it is supposed the whole length of forty cubits (the length of the gate without the porch) would hardly be roofed in; so that assuming a similar covered way of thirteen cubits at the other end of the gate-building, as one came "from the house," there would be an open space, well, or uncovered courtyard, of fourteen cubits in length and six broad, enclosed on all sides by gate-buildings. The roofs extending from the east and west would be supported on the "posts" of the chambers mentioned in ver. 10. Smend, however, infers, from the windows in the posts within the gate (ver. 16), that the whole extent was roofed in, and accordingly can offer no explanation of the clause; Kliefoth and Schroder prefer to regard the thirteen cubits as the height of the gate, although the word translated "length" never elsewhere has this meaning.

As the barrier projected one cubit on each side of the ten-cubit way, only eight cubits remained for persons going in or out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a></div><div class="verse">He measured then the gate from the roof of <i>one</i> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <i>was</i> five and twenty cubits, door against door.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth</span> of the gate from the roof of one little chamber or lodge to another, measuring from door to door, was <span class="cmt_word">five and twenty cubits</span>, which were thus made up: 10 cubits of footway + 12 (2 &times; 6) cubits for the two guard-rooms + 3 (2 &times; say 1.5) cubits for the thickness of the two side walls   =   25 cubits in all. According to ver. 42, the length of a hewn stone was one cubit and a half. The doors from which the measurements were taken must have been in the side walls at the back of the guard- looms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Ezekiel 40:14</a></div><div class="verse">He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made also posts</span>. In using the verb "made" the prophet either went back in thought to the time when the man who then explained the building had fashioned it (Hengstenberg); or he employed the term in the sense of <span class="accented">constituit</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed or estimated, "inasmuch as such a height could not be measured from the bottom to the top with the measuring-red" (Keil). The "posts," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of ver. 9, were sixty cubits high, and corresponded to the towers in modern churches. To the objection sometimes urged against what is called the "exaggerated" height of these columns, Kliefoth replies, "If it had been considered that our church towers have grown up out of gate-pillars, that one can see, not merely in Egyptian obelisks and Turkish minarets, but also in our own hollow factory chimneys, how upon a base of two cubits, square pillars of sixty cubits high can be erected, and that finally the talk is of a colossal building seen in vision, no critical difficulties would have been discovered in this statement as to height." The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">even unto the post of the court round about the gate</span>, should read, <span class="accented">and the court</span> reached <span class="accented">unto the post</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> being used collectively), <span class="accented">the gate</span> being <span class="accented">round about</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">the court round about the gate</span> reached to <span class="accented">the pillars</span> (Keil); or, <span class="accented">at the pillar the court</span> was round <span class="accented">about the gate</span> (Kliefoth). The sense is, that the court lay round about the inner egress from the gate. The Authorized Version, with which Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' agrees, thinks of an inner hall between the porch of the gate and the two most western guard-chambers, round the sides of which the sixty-cubit columns stood. Ewald, following the corrupt text of the LXX., translates, "And the threshold of the outer vestibule twenty cubits, the gate court abutting on the chambers round about."

That these "windows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, so called from being perforated) were intended to impart light to the gateway, either in whole or in part, is apparent, though it is difficult to form a clear idea of how they were situated. They were in the chambers, and in their posts and in the arches, or <span class="accented">colonnades</span> (Revised Version margin). In the chambers, or "lodges," they were most likely in the back walls, and in or near the posts, or pillars, belonging to the doors of these chambers, the clause, "and in their posts," being  regarded as epexegetic of the preceding, and designed to furnish a more precise explanation of the particular part of the guard-room in which the windows were. Similar windows existed in the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>). The "arches," or "colonnades" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>), were probably wall-projections on the sides of the chambers, to that light was admitted from three sides. Thus to one standing within, the whole gateway appeared studded round and round with windows. The description of the gate closes with the statement that upon each post were palm trees, which may signify either that the shaft was fashioned like a palm tree, as is sometimes seen in ancient buildings in the East (Dr. Currey, Plumptre) or that it was ornamented with representations of palm branches or palm trees (Keil, Ewald, Kliefoth). Hengstenberg's idea, that "whole palms beside the pillars are meant," is favored by Smend, who cites, in addition to ver. 26, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <i>there were</i> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <i>were</i> upon the pavement.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">outer court</span>. Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that <span class="cmt_word">chambers and a pavement</span> ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> always signifying single rooms in a building (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>), which ran round the court and was named <span class="cmt_word">the lower pavement</span>, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, <span class="accented">shoulder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the gates over against</span>  - or, <span class="accented">answerable to</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gates</span>. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court <span class="cmt_word">from the forefront of the lower gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, <span class="cmt_word">unto the forefront of the inner court</span> <span class="cmt_word">without was an hundred cubits</span>. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Its dimensions were the same as those of the "first" gate, fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.

The difference in the number of the steps was doubtless of symbolic significance, and pointed not only to the higher sanctity in general which attached to the inner court, but to the truth that, as one approached the dwelling-place of Jehovah, an increasing measure and degree of holiness were demanded - what Plumptre styles "an ever-ascending <span class="accented">sursum corda</span>." The seven steps of the outer door added to the eight steps of this amount to fifteen, with which corresponds the number of the pilgrim-psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/120.htm">Psalm 120-134</a>.), which are supposed to have been sung, one upon each step, by the choir of Levites as they ascended first into the outer and then into the inner court. The statement that the wall-projections were towards the outer court showed that, in walking through the inner gateway, one would reverse the order of the outer gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> would first pass through the porch, then cross the threshold to the guard-rooms, next step upon the second threshold, and finally enter the inner court.

As the verse explains, these were different from the guard-rooms in the gates (vers. 7, 21) and the chambers on the pavement (ver. 17), although the same Hebrew word is employed to designate the latter. The cells under consideration were expressly designed for washing "the inwards and the legs" of the victims brought for sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). Whether such a cell stood at each of the three gates, as the plural seems to indicate, although described only in connection with the north (Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre), or merely at one gate, and that the north - because, according to the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>), on the north side of the altar burnt, sin, and trespass offerings were to be killed (Havernick, Hengstenberg) - or the east, which is alluded to in vet, s. 39, 40 (Hitzig, Ewald, Smend), is controverted, though the former view seems the preferable, seeing that, according to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 2</a>, the priests were to prepare burnt offerings and peace offerings for the prince at the posts of the east gate.

As they were designed for heavy instruments, they were constructed of hewn stones a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; from which it may be argued the eight previously mentioned were made of wood.

As this sense is unsuitable, recourse must be had to its derivation (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, "to put, set, or fix"), which suggests as its import here either, as Ewald, Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Havernick, and Smend, following the LXX. and Vulgate, prefer, "ledges," or "border guards," on the edge of the tables, to keep the instruments or flesh from falling off; or, as Kimchi, Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre, after the Chaldean paraphrast, explain, "pegs" fastened in the wall for hanging the slaughtered caresses before they were flayed. In favor of the first meaning stand the facts that the second clause of this verse speaks of" tables," not of "walls," and that the measure of the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> is one of breadth rather than of length; against it are the considerations that the dual form, <span class="accented">shephataim</span>, fits better to a forked peg than to a double border, and that the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> are stated to have been fastened "in the house" (<span class="accented">ba-baith</span>), which again suits the idea of a peg fastened in the outer wall of the porch, rather than of a border fixed upon a table. The last clause of this verse is rendered by Ewald, after the LXX., "and over the tables" (obviously those standing outside of the porch) "were covers to protect them from rain and from drought;" and it is conceivable that coverings might have been advantageous for both the wooden tables and the officiating priests; only the Hebrew must be changed before it can yield this rendering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a></div><div class="verse">And without the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <i>was</i> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <i>was</i> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <i>having</i> the prospect toward the north.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">chambers of the ringers</span> According to ver. 44, these, of which the number is not recorded, were situated in the inner court, outside of the inner gate, at the side of the north gate, and looked towards the south, one only being located at the side of the east gate with a prospect towards the north. Interpreted in this way, they cannot have been the same as the "priests' chambers" mentioned in vers. 45, 46, though these also looked in the same direction. The language, however, seems to indicate that they were the same, and on this hypothesis it is difficult to understand how they should be called "the chambers of the singers," and at the same time be assigned to the priests, "the keepers of the charge of the house" and "the keepers of the charge of the altar." Hengstenberg. Kliefoth, Schroder, and others hold that Ezekiel purposed to suggest that in the vision-temple before him the choral service was no longer to be left exclusively in the hands of the Levites as it had been in the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>), but that the priests were to participate therein. Dr. Currey imagines the chambers may have been occupied in common by the singers and the priests when engaged on duty at the temple. The LXX. text reads, "And he led me unto the inner court, and behold two chambers in the inner court, one at the back of the gate which looks towards the north, and bearing towards the south, and one at the back of the gate which looks towards the south, and bearing towards the north;" and in accordance with this Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend propose sundry emendations on the Hebrew text. Since, however, it cannot be certified that the LXX. did not paraphrase or mistranslate the present rather than follow a different text, it is safer to abide by the renderings of the Authorized and Revised Versions. Yet one cannot help feeling that the LXX. translation has the merit of clearness and simplicity.

Under the Law the Levite families of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari had the charge of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25</a>, etc.); but of these Levites who kept the charge of the sanctuary, Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest had the oversight. Hence the priests alluded to by Ezekiel as the keepers of the charge of the house were most likely those who superintended the Levites in the execution of their tasks. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a></div><div class="verse">And the chamber whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the north <i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these <i>are</i> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The keepers of the charge of the altar</span>. These formed another body of priests, whose duties generally were to officiate in the temple-worship, and more specifically to sacrifice and burn incense upon the altars (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-6</a>.). Under the Law the priests were all descendants of Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>). By David these were divided into two classes - the sons of Eleazar, at the head of whom stood Zadok; and the sons of Ithamar, with Ahimelech as their chief (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>). In the vision-temple <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi</span> have the sole right of drawing near to the Lord to minister unto him (see on Ezekiel 43:15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a></div><div class="verse">So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar <i>that was</i> before the house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He measured the court... and the altar</span>. The dimensions of the former, the open space in front of the temple, alone are given - a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad; those of the latter, which stood before the "house," and occupied the center of the square, are afterwards recorded (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>). The distance from north to south of the inner court being a hundred cubits, if to these be added twice two hundred cubits, the space between the outer court wall and that of the inner court, the result will give five hundred cubits as the breadth of the outer court, from north gate to south gate. Then as the length of the inner court was a hundred cubits, if to these be added first the hundred cubits lying before the inner court towards the east, secondly, the hundred cubits covered by the temple (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), and thirdly, the one hundred cubits which extended behind the temple (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), the total will amount to five hundred cubits for the length of the outer court from east to west. The outer court, therefore, like the inner, was a square. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a></div><div class="verse">And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured <i>each</i> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <i>was</i> three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 48, 49.</span> - With these verses the following chapter ought to have commenced, as the seer now advances to a description of <span class="accented">the house</span>, or temple proper, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>, with its three parts - a porch (vers. 48, 49), a holy place (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>), and a holy of holies (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-4.htm">Ezekiel 41:4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The porch</span>, or vestibule, according to Keil, appears to have been entered by a folding door of two leaves, each three cubits broad, which were attached to two side pillars five cubits broad, and met in the middle, so that the whole breadth of the porch front was six cubits, or, including the posts, sixteen cubits. The measurements in ver. 49 of the length of the porch (from east to west) twenty cubits, and the breadth (from north to south) eleven cubits, he harmonizes with this view by assuming that the pillars, which were five cubits bread in front, were only half that breadth in the inside, the side wall dividing it in two, so that, although to one entering the opening was only six cubits, the moment one stood in the interior it was 6 cubits + 2 &times; 2.5 cubits   =   11 cubits. Kliefoth, however, rejects this explanation, and understands the three cubits to refer to the portion of the entrance on either side which was closed by a gate, perhaps of lattice-work, leaving for the ingress and egress of priests a passage of five cubits. In this view the whole front of the porch would he 5 cubits of passage + 6 (2 &times; 3) cubits of lattice-work + 10 (2 &times; 5) cubits of pillar, equal in all to 21 cubits. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' includes the three cubits of door in the five cubits of post, and, supposing the temple entrance to be ten cubits, makes the whole front to have been twenty cubits. We prefer Kliefoth's opinion.

The height of these is not given, though Hengstenberg again finds it in the elevation of the porch of Solomon's temple - a hundred and twenty cubits (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Their exact position is not stated; but they were probably, like Jachin and Boaz in the Solomonic temple, stationed one on each side of the steps. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/39.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 39"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 39" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/41.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 41"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 41" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
