They attributed this last colonization to Esar-haddon.

Profane history tells us of two intermediate kings, via, Cambyses, son of Cyrus, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 529</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 522</span>, and Smerdis, or Bardes, a usurper, who occupied the throne for about ten months in the years  <span class="date">B.C. 522</span>, 521. Darius became king in this last-named year, but seems to have counted his reign from the date of the decease of Cambyses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they <i>unto him</i> an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the reign of Ahasuerus.</span> Some critics regard this Ahasuerus as identical with the Ahasuerus of Esther, who is generally allowed to be Xerxes, the son and successor of Darius Hystaspis, and the invader of Greece. In this case the Artaxerxes of the next verse is taken to be Artaxerxes Longimanus, and the entire passage, from ver. 6 to ver. 23 inclusively, is regarded as parenthetic, having reference to events which happened later than any of those recorded in ch. 6. But the evident <span class="accented">nexus</span> of vers. 23, 24 is fatal to this view, which has nothing in its favour beyond the sequence of the royal names, an uncertain argument in this instance, since we know that Persian kings had often more than one name. If on these grounds we reject the proposed identification, and regard the chapter as chronologically consecutive, Ahasuerus here must be explained as Cambyses, and the Artaxerxes of ver. 7 as Smerdis. This is the view most usually taken, and it seems to the present writer to present fewer difficulties than any other. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the beginning of his reign.</span> As soon as ever a new king mounted the throne, fresh representations were made to him by the "adversaries," lest the work should be recommenced<span class="cmt_word">.

If Artaxerxes be the Pseudo-Smerdis, we can readily understand why an application was not made to him at once, and how it came about that the Jews recommenced their building, as they appear from vers. 12, 13 to have done. The Pseudo-Smerdis was a usurper; his reign was a time of partial anarchy; in a distant part of the empire it would not be known for a while who was king. Men would be thrown on themselves, and would do as it seemed good in their own eyes. Later, there may have been some doubt whether a king, who was known to be a religious reformer, would follow the policy of his predecessor with respect to the Jews, or reverse it. Hence a delay, and then a more formal application than before for a positive decree to stop the building (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The rest of their companions</span>.

The character and the words were alike Syriac (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26</a>). Ezra gives the letter in Chaldee. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rehum</span> <span class="cmt_word">the chancellor.</span> Literally, "the lord of judgment."

Herodotus tells us that in every Persian province the governor had a secretary attached to him, who was appointed by the crown, and acted as a check upon his nominal master (Herod., 3:128). The position assigned to Shim-shai in this chapter (see especially vers. 9, 17, 23) is such as might be expected under these circumstances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then <i>wrote</i> Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, <i>and</i> the Elamites,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Dinaites</span>, etc. It is curious that the Samaritans, instead of using a general appellation, describe themselves under the names of the various nations and cities which had furnished the colonists of whom they were the descendants. It would seem that they were not yet, in the time of the Pseudo-Smerdis, amalgamated into a single people. From the list of names we may gather that the colonists of Esar-haddon's time had been derived chiefly from Southern Babylonia and the adjacent regions of Susiana, Persia, and Elymais. The Babylonians, Susanchites, and Elamites speak for themselves, and require no explanation. The Archevites are the people of Ereeh or Orchoe (now Warka), a city to the south-east of Babylon. The Apharsites are no doubt Persians; the Dehavites, Dai or Dahae, a tribe located in Persia Proper ('Herod.,' 1:125). If uncertainty attaches to any of the names, it is to two only - the Dinaites and the Tarpelites. Of these, the Dinaites are probably the people of Dayan, a country bordering on Cilicia, whose inhabitants are often mentioned by the Assyrian monarchs. The Tarpelites have been regarded as the people of Tripolis; but it is improbable that that city had as yet received its Greek name. Perhaps they are the Tuplai, or people of Tubal, mentioned in Scripture and the Assyrian inscriptions, the letter <span class="accented">r</span> being a euphonic addition, as in Darmesek for Dammesek <span class="accented">sharbith</span> for <span class="accented">shebeth</span>, and the like.

Rather, "and so forth." This and the preceding verse set forth the address of Rehum's letter.

To us. To our part of the world - to Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Are...  building the rebellious</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the bad city.</span> The ground of this accusation must be sought in the various revolts of the Jews from the Babylonians recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24, 25</a>. There had been one, or perhaps two, previous revolts from Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); but of these the Samaritans probably knew nothing. They would, however, be likely to know that before Nebuchadnezzar took the extreme measure of removing the Jews from their own land to Babylon, they had rebelled against him three several times - once under Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>), once under his son Jehoiachin (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 10), and once under Zedekiah, the last king (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20). Thus they had a basis of truth on which to ground their charge that Jerusalem was "the rebellious and the bad city." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">have set up the walls thereof.</span> It appears very clearly from the book of Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem were not restored till his time, seventy-five years after this. The Samaritans, however, would naturally exaggerate, and call the rebuilding of the temple, and of a certain number of dwelling-houses, a fortifying of the place. The exaggeration, however, is not so great in the Chaldee text as in the Authorized Version. What is said seems to be, that "they <span class="accented">are setting up the walls and joining the foundations."</span> That the work was far from complete is admitted in the next verse. We may doubt whether it was really begun. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-13.htm">Ezra 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up <i>again, then</i> will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and <i>so</i> thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then will they not pay toll, tribute,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and custom.</span> This was plausible reasoning. In Greece, if a subject city set to work to fortify itself, rebellion was immediately anticipated, not unfairly. But the circumstances of the Persian empire were different. In the remoter parts of that empire the central government was weak, and disorders frequently occurred. A city might need fortifications to protect it against its immediate neighbours, when it had not the slightest intention of asserting independence. Judging from the later history, which shows no revolt of the Jews against Persia, we may say that the accusation now alleged was unfounded, though perhaps it was not made in bad faith. <span class="cmt_word">Toll</span>, <span class="cmt_word">tribute, and custom</span> represent the chief heads of Persian taxation, which, however, did not include "custom" in our sense of the word. The three terms used by the Samaritans really represent, respectively, "tribute," or the money payment required from each province, "provision," or the payment in kind equally required (Herod., 1:192; 3:91), and "toll," or contributions from those who made use of the Persian highways. According to the Samaritans, none of these would be paid by the Jews if Jerusalem was once fortified. <span class="cmt_word">And so thou shalt endamage the revenue.</span> The general meaning is given correctly enough by this rendering, but "revenue" is not expressly mentioned. <span class="accented">Aphthom</span>, the word so translated, means really "at length," "at last." Translate, "And so <span class="accented">at last</span> thou shalt endamage the kings."

The Samaritans suggest a consultation of this book, which would at any rate contain their own previous accusations against Jerusalem (<span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 5, 6), and might make some mention of the revolts from Babylon (see the comment on ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">which cause was this city destroyed.</span> This was the great fact on which the Samaritans relied. Nebuchadnezzar had only destroyed Jerusalem in consequence of repeated rebellions.

It is not quite clear whether the river intended here and in ver. 10 is the Euphrates or the Jordan. Generally in the Old Testament <span class="accented">hannahar</span> means the Euphrates, but the exaggeration is gross if that river was intended here. Only twice in their history had the Israelites advanced their frontier as far as that stream - under Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>) and under Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>); in their present depressed condition it was absurd to imagine that they could rival those early glories.

Accordingly, he had a search made among the state records, and found, as they had expected he would, evidence of insurrections on the part of the Jews against the foreign countries to which they had been subject, as Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>) and Babylon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 24:1; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>), and also proof of the formidable power possessed by certain Jewish or Israelite kings; upon which he thought himself justified in complying with the Samaritan request, and ordering the work that was going on at Jerusalem to cease (see ver. 21). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-20.htm">Ezra 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all <i>countries</i> beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mighty kings</span>. David and Solomon best answer to this description, possessing as they did a kingdom which extended from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>), and drawing tribute from the various petty princes or chiefs of the nations dwelling within those limits (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6-12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14, 25</a>). Josiah had perhaps, more recently, possessed an almost equally extensive sway. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-21.htm">Ezra 4:21</a></div><div class="verse">Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until <i>another</i> commandment shall be given from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until another commandment shall be given</span>. It can scarcely be supposed that the Pseudo-Smerdis had any intention of issuing "another commandment;" but, since "the laws of the Medes and Persians," as a general rule, "altered not" (<a href="../../par/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15</a>), it may well be that the clause before us was one inserted as a matter of form in most decrees, to prevent them from being irrevocable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-22.htm">Ezra 4:22</a></div><div class="verse">Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</div><div class="comm">

Having obtained the decree which forbad further building, they proceeded with it to Jerusalem, and by a display of force compelled the Jews to submission. No doubt resistance might have been made, but resistance would have been rebellion.

The Pseudo-Smerdis reigned, at the utmost, ten months; after which a revolution occurred, and the throne was occupied by Darius, the son of Hystaspes. If the work was resumed early in this monarch's second year, the entire period of suspension cannot have much exceeded a year and a half. <span class="cmt_word">King of Persia</span>. There is probably no intention of distinguishing the Darius of this book from "Darius the Mede" (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a>). "King of Persia" is appended to his name merely out of respect and honor, as it is to the names of Cyrus (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1, 2, 8</a>), Artaxerxes I. (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>), and Artaxerxes II. (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a>). Such a superfluous attachment to his name of the style and title of a monarch is common throughout the Old Testament, and generally marks a distinct intention to do the individual honour (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
