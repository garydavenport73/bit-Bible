He calls their attention first (<span class="accented">more Rabbinico</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> on ver. 5) to the Prophets (i.e. the former prophets, according to the Hebrew division), as teaching by example that holy things are of secondary importance compared with the benefit of God's people; and afterwards to the Law, which implies that the sabbath itself is of secondary importance compared with work necessary for the sanctuary. He then affirms that in the present case there is One present who is even greater than the sanctuary. He goes on to say that their complaint, however, was really due to the lack, not so much of intellectual as of spiritual knowledge; they had no <span class="accented">rapprochement</span> with the God of love, or they would not have condemned those who, both because they were men and because they were disciples of the Son of man, stood above the sabbath. <span class="cmt_word">What David did, when he was a hungred, and they that were with him</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-7</a>).

Dr. Lumby on <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, 'Add. Note').

A similarly difficult neuter is found in vers. 41, 45. If the neuter be insisted upon, we must understand Christ to refer to his cause, the work in which the disciples were engaged. This was greater than the temple; lunch more, therefore, was it greater than the sabbath. Probably, however, our Lord is referring to himself, to his own Person and character, but uses the neuter, either as forming a more decided contrast to <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, or as being more weighty than the masculine (cf. ch. 11:9, note). Also it was less defined and more mysterious. He could not reveal to them the secret of his presence. Observe the use, even at this stage in his ministry, of words implying the decadence of the temple service (cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). <span class="accented">In this place</span>; <span class="accented">here</span> (Revised Version), as in vers. 41, 42.

Christ clinches the argument, and at the same time explains his phrase in ver. 6. The temple is greater than the sabbath; I am greater than the temple; these my disciples are therefore guiltless; for, to put it briefly, I, whom they are following, am greater than the sabbath and rule over it. Observe, however, that Christ does not directly say "I," but <span class="accented">the Son of man.</span> The reason is seen in Mark, where a connecting link is given: "The sabbath was made for man. and not man for the sabbath: so that the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath." Christ there implies that the sabbath is inferior to man, not only because it exists for his sake (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-9.htm">1 Corinthians 11:9</a>),but also because it falls under the lordship referred to in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; and therefore that he himself is really superior to it as man, and much more as the ideal Man (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note). Our saying is very condensed, but includes the name thought, omitting <span class="accented">even</span> as unnecessary, after having definitely pronounced the innocence of his disciples. (For the thought of the saying, cf. 2 Macc. 5:19, "God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake," and the Midrash 'Mechilta,' on <a href="../../par/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, especially the words, "The sabbath is given to you, not yon to the sabbath."

In vers. 10, 11 there are reminiscences of a narrative, presumably belonging to the Framework, which is essentially preserved in <a href="../../par/luke/14-2.htm">Luke 14:2-5</a> (cf. Weiss). In this section the opposition of the Pharisees is turned directly against our Lord himself for breaking the sabbath. Observe, however, that he did not do this for his own benefit. It was his kindness to another that brought about the determination to kill him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was departed thence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The phrase implies more than removal from that place in the corn-fields where he had been accused by the Pharisees, and is to be understood of removal from one town to another, the words that originally preceded this narrative not being recorded (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="../../par/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a>, note). When. therefore, it took place we have absolutely no means of knowing, save that it was not on the same day as the event recorded in vers. 1-8 (cf. Luke, "on another sabbath"), and that it was later on in his ministry. <span class="cmt_word">He went into their synagogue</span>. Whose? Hardly the Pharisees mentioned in ver. 2, as this was a different occasion. Possibly the Galilaeans, among whom he then was (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>), or probably the Jews generally (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a>, note). In the two last cases the subject of "they asked," in ver. 10, would be the same as that of "they watched." in Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a>), namely, the frequenters of the synagogue. among whom the Pharisees naturally took a prominent place.

Although <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> usually represents in the New Testament God's decision as to the character and life of men, it here must be understood, like <span class="accented">mishpat</span> in the original, of the Divine right as made known to them for their acceptance and imitation. It is "the true religion viewed on its practical side as a norm and standard for life in all its relations" (Delitzsch). The thought here, therefore, is not of Christ's power to punish and avenge (though he refused to use it as yet), but of his bringing a revelation which should eventually spread, not only to the Jews who now rejected him, but to the Gentiles whom they despised.

But "strive" would represent one very frequent connotation of "cry aloud" and its synonyms, for in Eastern lands disputants use their voice much more loudly than we do. This close connexion between the two ideas is seen also in the Syriac Version of Isaiah,. where "lift up <span class="accented">his voice"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> translated <span class="accented">narib</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> word meaning primarily "he shall strive," and only secondarily "he shall lift up his voice."

Josephus also mentions some, but they are mere impostures; he <span class="accented">says</span> ('<span class="accented">Ant.</span>,' 08:02.5), "<span class="accented">Solomon</span> left behind him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away demons, so that they never return, and this method of cure is of great force  unto this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of Vespasian, and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the sure was this: he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to return into him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed" (cf. also Dr. Cheatham's article on "Exorcism," in 'Dict. of Christian Antiq.'). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they</span>.

Our Lord asks the preceding question, neither denying nor affirming for himself the fact that their disciples cast out devils, but only by way of argument. He implies, "You will answer that they do so by God's help. If so, then your sons shall be your judges, convicting you of insincerity. You acknowledge that they work miracles by God's help, and you do not acknowledge that I do. But you cannot stop short there. You must acknowledge that I also cast out devils by God's help."

Observe that this could not be affirmed from the success of the Pharisees' disciples, for with them expulsion of devils, even if it were real, was, as it were, accidental, standing in no close connexion with their work (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, note).

The interpretation of the parable is self-evident: the strong man is Satan; his vessels are those afflicted by him; the one who binds, etc., is Christ.

The aim of this verse is doubtful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It may be addressed to the Pharisees, with the object of showing them what their words really implied. They were not due, as some might think, to mere indifferentism or to a judicial neutrality; such a relation to him was impossible. They were due to opposition of inner life and of outward energy. Thus their words denoted complete separation from him. This he brings out more clearly in the two following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, would attribute to the Pharisees too great an ignorance of their own feelings of opposition to Christ, and it is therefore best to understand the verse as addressed to the many bystanders. Christ has do-fended himself from the accusation brought against him, and now urges these waverers not to be content with only not opposing him, but to take sides - for, in fact, they cannot help doing so. Indifference in this case is only another name for opposition; not actively to help is really to hinder. Thus understood, the lesson of this verse finds its parallel in vers. 43-45, by which,  indeed, it is immediately followed in Luke. <span class="cmt_word">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad</span>. The first clause speaks of the inner disposition, that which forms the real being of the man; the second, of his energy. Observe that the figure of the second clause appears to be connected with that of ver. 29. If Christ's property is not collected, it is driven further from him. Christ and Christians must gather (<a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>; cf. Bengel). For <span class="accented">gathereth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>.

Notice that in <a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, referred to above, the two verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, also occur; the figure there, however, appears to be taken from sheep (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). Further, <a href="../../par/mark/9-40.htm">Mark 9:40</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/9-50.htm">Luke 9:50</a> record the saying, "He that is not against us is for us," which was addressed to our Lord's disciples. Both sayings are necessary; earnest Christians need to remember that when outsiders do anything in Christ's name, it must, on the whole, forward his cause (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-18.htm">Philippians 1:18</a>); the undecided must face the fact that neutrality is impossible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/12-31.htm">Matthew 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy <i>against</i> the <i>Holy</i> Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/3-28.htm">Mark 3:28-30</a> (where the verses immediately follow our ver. 29) and <a href="../../par/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a> (where the context is not the same, he having passed straight from our ver. 30 to our ver. 43, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). It is to be observed that all three accounts differ a good deal in form, though but slightly in substance. The Apostolical Constitutions contain what is probably a mixture of these verses with <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a> and other passages of the New Testament. Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 130, 249, etc.), in accordance with his theory, thinks that the Constitutions have preserved a genuine utterance of the Lord, of which only different fragments are presented in various parts of the New Testament. A few words of introduction to these difficult verses. It has been strangely forgotten, in their interpretation, that our Lord spoke in language that he intended his hearers to understand, and that probably not a single one of those who stood by would understand by the expressions, ,, the Spirit" (ver. 31), "the Holy Spirit" (ver. 32), a Person in the Godhead distinct from the First Person or the Second (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>, note). At most they would understand them to refer to an influence by God upon men (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>), such as Christ had claimed to possess in a special degree (<a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). In inquiring, therefore, for an explanation of our Lord's sayings, we must not begin at the Trinitarian standpoint, and see in the words a contrast between "blasphemy" against one Person of the Trinity, and "<span class="accented">blasphemy"</span> against another. The contrast is between "blasphemy" against Christ as Son of man, Christ in his earthly work and under earthly conditions, the Christ whom they saw and whom they did not understand, and "blasphemy" against God as such working upon earth. "<span class="accented">Blasphemy"</span> against the former might be due to ignorance and prejudice, but "blasphemy" against the latter was to speak against God's work recognized as such, against God manifesting himself to their consciences (cf. vers. 27, 28); it was to reject the counsel of God towards them, to set themselves up in opposition to God, and thus to exclude from themselves forgiveness. Just as under the Law there were sacrifices for sins of ignorance and minor offences, but none for wilful disregard of and opposition to God, so must it be at all times even under the gospel itself. Observe that the "blasphemy" is understood by our Lord as showing the state of the heart (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). What the effect of a change of heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of repentance, would be does not enter into our Lord's utterance. All other sin is venial, but for heart-opposition there is no forgiveness. <span class="accented">As</span> Tyndale says ('Expositions,' p. 232, Parker Society), "<span class="accented">Sin</span> against the Holy Ghost is despising of the gospel and his working. Where that bideth is no remedy of sin: for it fighteth against faith, which is the forgiveness of sin. If that be put away, faith may enter in, and all sins depart." (Cf. also Dorner, ' System,' 3:73; 4:91.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Referring primarily to ver. 30, and to be joined closely to "I say unto you." Because such is the terrible effect of what you think mere indifferentism, I say this solemnly, Beware of committing the great sin. Luke's connexion of our ver. 43 with ver. 30 gives a good but a weaker sense - Become fully decided, lest the devil return to you stronger than ever. Matthew's connexion is - Become fully decided, for the legitimate outcome of want of decision is the sin that will not be forgiven. <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>,  note), <span class="cmt_word">All manner of;</span> <span class="accented">every</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Sin</span> <span class="cmt_word">and blasphemy.</span> Genus and species (Meyer). <span class="accented">Blasphemy</span> passes in this verse from its wider meaning of open slander and detraction in the first clause to its now commoner but restricted meaning of speech against God in the second clause. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</span>; <span class="accented">the Spirit</span> (Revised Version), thus making it more possible for the English reader to see the connexion of thought with the phrase in ver. 28. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be forgiven unto men.</span> The words, <span class="accented">unto men</span>, must be omitted, with the Revised Version.

If it be asked whether the individual Pharisees referred to in vers. 24-28 had committed this sin, the answer depends upon whether they had recognized the hand of God as such, and had, notwithstanding, wilfully rejected it. If they had - as our Lord's tone seems to imply - then they had in fact committed it.

But the account existed in more than one of the sources used by St. Matthew, and as each form of it had its own peculiarities (especially our ver. 24 and <a href="../../par/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2, 3</a>), he retained them both. Anyhow, <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a> seems to have belonged to the Framework, and our passage to the Discourses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> It will be noticed that all the passages except <a href="../../par/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a> speak of "the sign of Jonah." How was Jonah a sign? Our ver. 40 seems to answer the question, and to say that it was by being in the whale's belly three days and three nights. But there are serious difficulties in accepting this view as finally and alone right. For in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a> no explanation at all is recorded (though, indeed, it might be urged that the evangelist might fairly expect his readers to remember our ver. 40), and in <a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> apparently a different explanation is found, "for even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation" - words which, taken alone, would seem to refer to Jonah being a sign by the mere fact of his preaching. Thus our Lord would mean - As Jonah preached, so I preach. The future is used in <a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as bringing out  more clearly than the present would have done the final relation in which Christ should stand to his contemporaries. Godet, indeed, urges that the future excludes any present reference to Christ's work as preaching, and that the demand for a sign <span class="accented">from heaven</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>) can only be fully satisfied by Christ's resurrection, "in which no human agency intervenes, and in which Divine power appears alone." He, therefore, makes Luke's meaning identical with that of our ver. 40, and paraphrases thus: "It was as one who had miraculously escaped from death that Jonas presented himself before the Ninevites, summoning them to anticipate the danger which threatened them; it is as the Risen One that I (by my messengers) shall proclaim salvation to the men of this generation." But this would almost assume that Jonah told the Ninevites of his miraculous escape, though there is not a hint of his having done so. On the contrary, <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, implies that the call to repentance on the basis of punishment threatened was the sole and only means employed by the prophet to accomplish his mission. Jonah the preacher became, by virtue of his preaching, a sign to the Ninevites (for, quite apart from his miraculous preservation, his appearance in Nineveh and his preaching there were no small portent and sign of Divine interest in the Ninevites' affairs), and they accepted him. Matthew's addition, "the prophet," emphasizes this thought, even though he passes on to give what appears to have been the Lord's secondary interpretation of <span class="accented">the sign of Jonah.</span> Christ's primary object, then, in his reply was to show to his opponents that heathen Ninevites and a heathen queen accepted the truth without any such sign as that which they were now demanding, and, if possible, to shame them into doing so. Thus ver. 40 is to be considered as parenthetical rather than as the main subject. It has, indeed, been suggested that ver. 40 was in fact not spoken at all by the Lord himself, but is only the result of a very early interpretation by the Hebrew Christians of our Lord's phrase, added before the formation of our Gospel. The explanation is tempting, but, in the entire absence of corroboration, cannot be accepted (cf. note there). So far as our present evidence goes, we must attribute ver. 40 to Christ, and consider that as he was mentioning the reception of Jonah by the Ninevites, the thought occurred to him that in Jonah's history lay as it were a prefigurement of what he himself would be. Just as on another occasion he illustrated his death and resurrection by the figure of destroying and building the temple (<a href="../../par/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18, 19</a>), so now he uses the figure of Jonah in the whale's belly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> This is not the place to enter upon a discussion of the question whether the event here referred to literally happened or not, much less to examine the deep and mysterious subject of the Lord's kenosis (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). But it should be observed that some at least of those critics who do not believe that the narrative of Jonah being in the whale's belly is to be understood literally, consider that his preaching to the Ninevites at all is equally metaphorical (cf. C. H. H. Wright, 'Introduction to Old Testament,' p. 207, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>), <span class="accented">so</span> that not only ver. 40 but ver. 41 and <a href="../../par/luke/11-32.htm">Luke 11:32</a> are affected, and that indeed more seriously, since the Lord says that the Ninevites will stand up as witnesses. The reasons for taking the narrative as only metaphorical are far from convincing, yet even if they were overwhelming, the illustration in ver. 40 (though not ver. 41) would still remain valid, just as (with all reverence be it spoken) any one to-day might illustrate his action from that of one of Shakespeare's characters whose historical existence is more than doubtful. While, however, the frequency of the allegorical and pictorial in Hebrew poetry and prophecy must be fully allowed for, there seems to be no strong reason (apart from the miracle) to doubt the historical character of the narrative. Further, as to the miracle, <a href="../../par/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a> are so closely connected with <a href="../../par/jonah/1.htm">Jonah 1, 3</a>, and 4, that it is best to understand the writer as intending to represent it (marvellous though it is) as literal history. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-45.</span> - Some of our Lord's opponents try to defend themselves by asking for a sign of his authority to claim so much; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 30 (ver. 38). In his reply he refers them to their own histories for proof that such a demand is inexcusable. The Ninevites did not require one when Jonah became a sign to them - and in mentioning  Jonah he refers to his being in the whale's belly three days and three nights as a symbol of what should happen to himself - and "the queen of the south" took immense trouble to satisfy her craving after wisdom (vers. 39-42). Therefore let them beware; their present state was one of extreme danger; the improvement that they showed was only negative, and if they did not take care worse would happen to them in the future than in the past (vers. 43-45). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then certain</span>.

Since, so far as the balance of evidence goes (cf., however, Bishop Westcott, 'Introduction,' p. 344, edit. 1872), the Crucifixion was on Friday and the Resurrection on Sunday, the actual time between them was only one clear day and two parts of days (which might fairly be called three days) and two whole nights. The reckoning, therefore, here is, strictly speaking, inaccurate. The words are perhaps a mere adaptation of the phrase in Jonah, and are here used only to roughly mark the time of our Lord's stay in the grave. Observe, however, that the addition of" nights" tends to emphasize the reality of our Lord's stay there. It was a matter of days and nights; he spent both kinds of earthly time "in the heart of the earth" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>, note). It will be noticed that the inaccuracy of the wording would, if modern Western habits were alone to be considered, make it most unlikely that the phrase is a later addition; but in view of the early Christian and Jewish method of illustrating events by passages of Scripture which do not apply in all respects, the improbability is not so great as would at first sight appear. However, upon our present information, we must say that the phrase was spoken by our Lord himself, and that although the exact time of his stay in the grave was well known to the early believers, they continued to repeat the saying in the form in which the Lord left it. In <span class="accented">the heart of the earth.</span> The form of the expression is derived from <a href="../../par/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a> (4), "in the heart of the seas" (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>), and would therefore appear to mean some deeper place than the rock-hewn sepulchre. Hence many commentators, beginning with Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' V. 31.) and Tertullian ('De Anima,' Iv.), understand it as directly denoting the place of departed spirits. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> ("the lower parts of the earth"), on the contrary, probably refers to the earth as such in contrast to heaven.

A solemn warning against a merely negative improvement. External preparation, mechanical religion, is insufficient; a definite acceptance of my teaching is required. Our Lord's primary thought Would appear to be the relation in which those to whom he was speaking stood to himself. But he frames his words so as to include the whole of that generation of Jews (vers. 39, 45) For his present hearers truly represented their contemporaries.

The verse is omitted by the Sinaitic manuscript (original hand), the Vatican, and a few others; also by the Old Syriac and some manuscripts of the Old Latin Version.
