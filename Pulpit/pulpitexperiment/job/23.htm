He begins by justifying the vehemence of his complaints, first, on the ground of the severity of his sufferings (ver. 2), and secondly, on the ground of his conviction that, if God would bring him to an open trial before his tribunal, he would acquit him (vers. 3-12). By the way, he complains that God hides himself, and cannot be found (vers. 3, 8, 9). He then further complains that God is not to be bent from his purpose, which is set against Job (vers. 13-17). In ch. 24. he goes over ground already trodden, maintaining the general prosperity of the wicked, and their exemption from any special earthly punishment (vers. 2-24). He winds up, finally, with a challenge to his opponents to disprove the truth of what he has said (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Job answered and said, Even to-day is my complaint bitter</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even to-day, notwithstanding all that has been said by my opponents against my right to complain, I do complain, and as bitterly as ever. And I justify my complaint on the following ground - my stroke is heavier than my groaning. If I complain bitterly, I suffer even more bitterly (comp. <a href="../../par/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Oh that I knew where I might find him! <i>that</i> I might come <i>even</i> to his seat!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that I knew where I might find him!</span> This is the cry of the desolate human soul, feeling its need of God, and yet not knowing how to approach him. God seems to be very far removed from us. He is in heaven, and we are on earth; nay, he is in the highest heaven, or outside it, walking on its circumference (<a href="../../par/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>). How are we to approach near to him, so near as to be sure that he can hear us? How are we to "find" him? So, in all ages, has the human heart gone out to God, aspiring towards him, seeking after him, but, for the most part, baffled and disappointed. Job, like most other men in the olden times, though he has faith in God, though he serves him and prays to him, has yet the feeling that he is remote, distant, well-nigh inaccessible. It needed revelation to let man know that God is not far off, but very near to each one of us; that "in him we live, and move, and have our being" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might come even to his seat!</span> Job's idea of bridging the distance between himself and God is that he should rise to the region where God is, not that God should condescend to come down to him. He wishes to "come to God's seat" - to that awful throne in the heaven of heavens, where God sitteth, surrounded by his hosts of angels, dealing out justice and judgment to mortal men (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">I would order <i>my</i> cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I would order my cause before him</span>. Job has put away the feelings of shame and diffidence, which were predominant with him when he said, "How should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>); and again, "How much less shall I answer him, and cheese out my words to reason with him? Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; but I would make my supplication to my Judge" (<a href="../../par/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14, 15</a>). He now wishes to contend and argue and reason. This is quite in accordance with our experience. Many am the moods of man - various and conflicting his desires! His mind never continues long in one stay. <span class="cmt_word">And fill my mouth with arguments</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>, where our translators render the same word by "reproofs," but where "arguments" or "pleadings" would be more appropriate). The LXX. has there <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, and in the present passage <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The word is forensic. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-5.htm">Job 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">I would know the words <i>which</i> he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I would know the words which he would answer me.</span> It would be a satisfaction to Job in his present mood to know exactly how God would answer him, what reply he would make to his "arguments." The tone of thought is too bold for a creature, and would certainly not be becoming in Christians. <span class="cmt_word">And understand what he would say unto me</span>. Here we have another of the redundant second clauses, which merely echo the idea contained in the previous clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-6.htm">Job 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">Will he plead against me with <i>his</i> great power? No; but he would put <i>strength</i> in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will he plead against me with his great power?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Would he contend against me in the greatness of his power?</span> (see the Revised Version). Flint is, "Would he crush me by mere strength and force? Would he use against me that overwhelming  might which he possesses? No, Job answers, certainly not; but he would put strength in me; or, rather, <span class="accented">but he would give heed to me</span> <span class="accented">he would pay attention to my</span> cause (comp. <a href="../../par/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>, ad fin., where the same verb is used). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-7.htm">Job 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There the righteous might dispute with him</span>. There, before his high tribunal (ver. 3), the upright man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;</span>) might argue or reason with him, appealing from his justice to his mercy - from God the Judge to God the Saviour (Loathes), vindicating his integrity, acknowledging his transgressions, and pleading that they were sins of infirmity-and at last obtaining from God the acquittal anticipated in the second clause of the verse. In the absence of any revelation of an Advocate who will plead our cause before God for us, Job would seem to have been justified in expecting such a liberty of pleading his own cause as he here sets forth<span class="cmt_word">. So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge</span>. The "Judge of all the earth" will certainly and necessarily "do right." Job's conscience testifies to his substantial integrity and uprightness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). He is, therefore, confident that, if he can once bring his cause to God's cognizance, he will obtain acquittal and deliverance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-8.htm">Job 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I go forward, but he <i>is</i> not <i>there</i>; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - Here Job returns to the complaint of ver. 3. He cannot "find" God. God hides himself. It is in vain that he searches on every side. There is no manifestation, no open vision. Nothing, however, leads him to doubt God's existence, or even his presence where he is unperceived. "Job's conviction of God's absolute presence comes out most strongly when he feels that he cannot discern him" (Cook). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there</span>; that is, "He is not there to my <span class="accented">perceptions</span>." I may believe it, but I have no sensible proof of it, and I cannot demonstrate it. <span class="cmt_word">And backward, but I cannot perceive him</span>. In describing locality, the Hebrews, Arabs, and Orientals generally always imagined themselves to be looking eastward, facing the rising sun. Hence the same word is used for" in front," "forwards," and "the east;" for "behind," "backwards," and "the west;" for "the left hand" and "the north;" for "the right hand" and "the south." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <i>him</i>: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <i>him</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the left hand, where he doth work;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in his workshop.</span> There is an ellipse after "workshop" of some phrase like "I look for him." But I cannot behold him; rather, <span class="accented">but I apprehend him not -</span> I cannot as it were, lay my hand upon him (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him</span>; literally, and I do not see <span class="accented">him.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">But he knoweth the way that I take: <i>when</i> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he knoweth the way that I take</span>; or, <span class="accented">the way that is with me. My</span> inability to find God does not in any way interfere with his perfect knowledge of me. God knows both "the way of the righteous" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>) "and "the way of the wicked," which" he turns upside down "(<a href="../../par/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). He is "about our path, and about our bed, and spieth out all our ways" (<a href="../../par/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as gold from the furnace, I shall come forth purified, when my trial is over (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>, etc.). Job seems at last to have woke up to the conception that there is a purifying power in affliction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a></div><div class="verse">My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My foot hath held his steps</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hath held dose to his steps</span>, or <span class="accented">his path</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have followed in God's way, and kept as close to it as possible. In other words. <span class="cmt_word">I have kept his way, and not declined from it.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a></div><div class="verse">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <i>food</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips.</span> Professor Lee rightly observes that this declaration "takes it for granted that, at least, some precepts of God had been revealed before this time" ('Book of Job,' p. 370). Them were "commandments" which Job recognized as having proceeded from God, and "words" which he looked upon as being the utterances of his mouth. This is strong evidence of a primeval revelation which, if not reduced to writing, had, at any rate, been handed down by tradition to Job's day. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14-19</a> and Genesis 9:1-7 may afford the true explanation of this difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food</span>. This is scarcely strong enough. Job says, "<span class="accented">I have treasured up</span> <span class="accented">taken to myself</span>, <span class="accented">and preserved</span> the words of his mouth," either "more than my necessary food" or "more than my own law." If the former rendering be preferred, there is no need of explanation; if the latter, we must regard "my own law" as meaning "the law of my own mind, my own will, the will of the natural man" (Cook). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-13.htm">Job 23:13</a></div><div class="verse">But he <i>is</i> in one <i>mind</i>, and who can turn him? and <i>what</i> his soul desireth, even <i>that</i> he doeth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?</span> Once more we hear the voice of complaint. The happier tone of thought which extends from ver. 6 to ver. 12 grows out of a sanguine hope on Job's part that God will bring him before his tribunal, and judge his cause according to righteousness. Now he bethinks himself that hitherto God, notwithstanding his prayers, has refused to summon him to his judgment-seat, and begins to fear that there is no likelihood of his changing. "He is One," or "in one." With him is "no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).  How is it likely that he will act in the future otherwise than he has acts! in the past? <span class="cmt_word">What his soul desireth, even that he doeth</span>. A somewhat harsh way of saying that God doeth that which seemeth him best - and which, therefore, is best. Job does not really suppose that God is actuated by caprice or favouritism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a></div><div class="verse">For he performeth <i>the thing that is</i> appointed for me: and many such <i>things are</i> with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span> he will assuredly accomplish whatever he has decreed for me. I cannot expect that he will blench or change. <span class="cmt_word">And many such things are with him.</span> He has many other weapons in his armoury, many other woes with which he might afflict me.

The thought of these further afflictions troubles me, and makes me shrink from his unseen presence. I know not how soon he may lay a fresh burden upon me. <span class="cmt_word">When I consider, I am afraid of him</span>. When I reflect on the many forms of suffering which I may still have to undergo, my fears increase, I tremble at the future.
