Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31). The chapter is the most touching in the whole book. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision</span>. As Job had been speaking last of the honour in which he was once held, he beans his contrast by chewing how at present he is disgraced and derided. Men who are outcasts and solitary themselves, poor dwellers in caves (ver. 6), who have much ado to keep body and soul together (vers. 3, 4), and not men <span class="accented">only</span> but youths, mere boys, scoff at him, make him a song and a byword (ver. 9). nay, "spare not to spit in his face" (ver. 10). There seem to have been in his vicinity weak and debased tribes, generally contemned and looked down upon, regarded as thieves (ver. 5) by their neighbours, and considered to be of base and vile origin (ver. 8), who saw in Job's calamities a rare opportunity for insulting and triumphing over a member of the superior race which had crushed them, and thus tasting, to a certain extent, the sweetness of revenge. <span class="cmt_word">Whose fathers I would have disdained</span> (rather, I <span class="accented">disdained</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to have set with the dogs of my flock</span>. Job had not <span class="accented">thought</span> their fathers <span class="accented">worthy of employ</span>ing even as the lowest class of herdsmen, those reckoned on a par with the sheep-dogs.

An effete race seems to be pointed at, without strength or stamina, nerveless, spiritless, "destined to early decay and premature death;" but how they had sunk into such a condition is not apparent. Too often such remanents are merely tribes physically weak, whom more powerful ones have starved and stunted, driving them into the least productive regions, and in every way making life hard for them.

One of the plants on which they feed is the <span class="accented">malluch</span>, not really a "mallow," but probably the <span class="accented">Atriplex halimus</span> which is "a shrub from four to five feet high, with many thick branches; the leaves are rather sour to the taste; the flowers are purple, and very small; it grows on the sea-coast in Greece, Arabia, Syria, etc., and belongs to the natural order <span class="accented">Chenopodiace"</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> Smith's  'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 215). <span class="cmt_word">And juniper roots for their meat</span>.

It is a leguminous plant, having a white flower. and grows plentifully in the Sinaitic desert, in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia. The root is very bitter, and would only be used as food under extreme pressure, but the fruit  is readily eaten by sheep, and the roots would, no doubt, yield some nourishment (see Dr. Cunningham Geikie's work,' The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 258). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/30-5.htm">Job 30:5</a></div><div class="verse">They were driven forth from among <i>men</i>, (they cried after them as <i>after</i> a thief;)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were driven forth from among men</span>. Weak races retreat before strong ones, who occupy their lands, and whose will they do not dare to dispute. They are not intentionally "driven out," for the strong raecs would gladly make them their drudges; but they retire into the most inaccessible regions, as the primitive population has done in India and elsewhere. They cried after them as after a thief. Outcast tribes naturally, and almost necessarily, become robber-tribes. Deprived of their productive lands, and driven into rocky deserts, want makes them thieves and marauders. Then those who have made them what they are vilify and decry them.

Western Asia is full of rocky regions, seamed with deep gorges and clefts, the walls of which rise abruptly or in terraces, and are themselves pierced with caves and cracks. The tract about Petra is, perhaps, the most remarkable of these regions; but there are many others which closely resemble it. These places afford refuges to weak and outcast tribes, who hide in them, either in caves of the earth, or in the rocks. The Greeks called these unfortunates "Troglodytes"(Herod., 4:183; Strabo, 16. p. 1102; Diod. Sic., 3:14.etc.), the Hebrews "Horim," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> "a hole."

Compare what Herodotus says of his Troglodytes: "Their language is unlike that of any other people; it sounds like the screeching of bats." <span class="cmt_word">Under the nettles</span> (or, <span class="accented">wild</span> <span class="accented">vetches</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they were gathered together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">huddled together</span>.

Some of the degraded races cannot count beyond four or five; others have not more than two or three hundred words in their vocabulary. They are all of low intellect, though occasionally extremely artful and cunning. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, children of base men</span>; literally, <span class="accented">children of no name.</span> Their race had never made for itself any name, but was unknown and insignificant. <span class="cmt_word">They were viler than the earth</span>; rather, they <span class="accented">were scourged out of the land.</span> This must not be understood literally. It is a rhetorical repetition of what had been already said in ver. 5. The expression may be compared with the tale in Herodotus, that when the Scythian slaves rebelled and took up arms, the Scythians scourged them into subjection (Herod., 4:3, 4).

And spare not to spit in my face. This has generally been taken literally, as it seems to have been by the LXX. But it, perhaps, means no more than that they did not refrain from spitting <span class="accented">in Job's presence</span> (see Professor Lee's ' Book of Job,' p. 422).

"He," in this passage, can only be God; and thus Job turns here to some extent from his human persecutors to his great Afflicter, the Almighty. God has "loosened his <span class="accented">cord</span>" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has relaxed his vital fibre, taken away his strength, reduced him to helplessness. Hence, and hence only, do the persecutors dare to crowd around him and insult him. <span class="cmt_word">And afflicted me</span>. God has afflicted him with blow after blow - with impoverishment (<a href="../../par/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14-17</a>), with bereavement (<a href="../../par/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18, 19</a>), with a sore malady (<a href="../../par/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>). They have also let loose the bridle before me. This has given his persecutors the courage to east aside all restraint, and lead him with insult after insult (vers. 1, 9, 10).

"Terrors' take hold upon him. He experiences in his sleep horrible dreams and visions (see <a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>), and even in his waking hours he is haunted by fears. The "terrors of God do set themselves in array against him" (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). God seems to him as One that watches, and "tries him every moment" (<a href="../../par/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>), seeking occasion against him, and never leaving him an instant's peace (<a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>). These terrors, he says, <span class="cmt_word">pursue my soul as the wind</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pursue mine honour</span>, or <span class="accented">my dignity.</span> They flutter the calm composure that befits a godly man, disturb it, shake it, and for a time at any rate, cause terrors and shrinkings of soul. Under these circumstances<span class="cmt_word">, my welfare passeth away as a cloud</span>. It is not only my happiness, but my real welfare, that is gone. Body and soul are equally in suffering - the one shaken with fears and disturbed with doubts and apprehensions; the other smitten with a sore disease, so that there is no soundness in it.

In <span class="accented">Elephantiasis anaesthetics</span> says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, "when the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, and sometimes of the vertebral column. <span class="accented">These pains are greatest at night</span>; they prevent sleep, and give rise to restless,less and frightful dreams" (Quain's  'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817).

The bitterest cry upon the cross was "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" But no good man is ever really God-forsaken, and no rightful and earnest prayers are ever really unheard. Job "had need of patience" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>), patient as he was (<a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>). He should have trusted God more, and complained less. <span class="cmt_word">I stand up, and thou regardest me not</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">stand up</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the manner of the Jews usually was in prayer (<a href="../../par/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>), <span class="accented">and thou lookest at me</span> (see the Revised Version).

Job never forgets that for long years God was gracious and kind to him, "made him and fashioned him together round about," "clothed him with skin and flesh, and fenced him with bones and sinews," "granted him life and favour, and by his visitation preserved his spirit" (<a href="../../par/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9-12</a>); but the recollection brings, perhaps, as much of pain. as of pleasure with it.

Job has all along expressed his conviction that he has nothing to look for but death. He feels within himself the seeds of a mortal malady; for such, practically, was elephantiasis in Job's time. He  is devoid of any expectation of recovery. Death must come upon him, he thinks, ere long; and then God will bring him to the house appointed for all living. This, as he has already explained (<a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>), is "the land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness." It is a melancholy prospect; but we must regard it as cheered by the hope of an ultimate resurrection, such as seems indicated, if not absolutely proclaimed, in <a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a> (see the comment on that passage).

This is one of the most obscure passages in the entire Book of Job, and scarcely any two independent commentators understand it alike. To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader. It will, per-Imps, suffice to select the one which to the present writer appears the most satisfactory. This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: "Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity." The same writer further explains the passage as follows: "I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit."

When men wept and entreated me, did not I do my best to give them the aid which they requested? Did not I weep for them, and intercede with God for them? Was not my soul grieved for the poor? (comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12-17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a></div><div class="verse">When I looked for good, then evil came <i>unto me</i>: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I looked for flood, then evil came unto me</span>. Job was "looking for good," expecting fully the continuance of his great wealth and prosperity, when the sudden shock of calamity fell upon him It was wholly unexpected, and therefore the harder to bear. And when I waited for light, there came darkness. This may refer to periods, after his calamities began, when he had hopes that his prayers would be answered, and a rest or pause, an interval of repose, be granted him (<a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>), but when his hopes were disappointed, and the darkness closed in upon him thicker and murkier than ever.

It is his present condition of which Job speaks from ver. 27 to ver. 31. His "entrails," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his whole innermost nature, is disturbed, tormented, thrown into confusion. The days of affliction prevented me; rather, <span class="accented">are come upon me</span> (comp. ver. 16).

Job feels this as the most pitiable feature in his ease. He is broken down; he can no longer endure. At first he could sit in silence for seven days (<a href="../../par/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>); now he is reduced to uttering complaints and lamentations. <span class="cmt_word">He is a brother</span>, not to dragons, but to <span class="accented">jackals.</span> His laments are like the long melancholy cries that those animals emit during the silence of the night, so well known to Eastern travellers. He adds further that he is a companion, not to owls, but <span class="accented">to ostriches</span>; which, like jackals, have a melancholy cry (see <a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>; and comp. Dr. Hooker's article in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 650).

The "burning pains" in the bones, which characterize at least one form of elephantiasis, have been already mentioned (see the comment on ver. 17). In ordinary elephantiasis there is often "intense pain in the lumbar region and groin," which the patient might think to be in his bones.

The result of all is that Job's harp is laid aside, either literally or figuratively. Its music is replaced by the sound of mourning (see vers. 28, 29). <span class="cmt_word">And my organ</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">my pipe</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into the voice of them that weep</span>. The pipe also is no longer sounded in his presence; he hears only the voice of weeping and lamentation.
