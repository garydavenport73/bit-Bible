The writer explains the purpose of the providence. It is doubtful whether "he" refers to Samson or to the Lord. Most commentators refer it to Samson; but it is contrary to the whole tenor of Samson's impetuous course, and to all probability, that he should have asked for the Timnathite damsel merely for the sake of quarreling with the Philistines; whereas the statement that Samson s obstinate determination to take a Philistine wife was the means which God's secret purpose had fixed upon for bringing about the eventual overthrow of the Philistine dominion is in exact accordance with other declarations of Holy Scripture (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-25.htm">1 Samuel 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-15.htm">1 Kings 12:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">2 Chronicles 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-7.htm">2 Chronicles 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-20.htm">2 Chronicles 25:20</a>). An occasion. The noun only occurs here; but the verb, in its several conjugations, means, to <span class="accented">happen at the right time</span>; <span class="accented">to bring a person or thing at the right time</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, <span class="accented">deliver</span>, A.V.); to <span class="accented">be brought at the right time</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>, happen, A.V.); to seek <span class="accented">the right time for injuring any one</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>, <span class="accented">seeketh a quarrel</span>, A.V. ). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went down</span>, showing that Timnath was on lower ground than Zorah; it was in fact in the <span class="accented">Shephelah</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The vineyards of Timnath</span>. The valley of Sorek (<a href="../../par/judges/16-4.htm">Judges 16:4</a>), so famous for its vines (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), from which it derived its name (<span class="accented">Sorek</span>, translated in the above passages <span class="accented">the choicest vine</span>, and <span class="accented">a noble vine</span>), is thought to have been in the immediate neighbourhood. Probably the whole district under the hills was a succession of vineyards, like the country round Bordeaux. Samson had left the road along which his father and mother were walking, at a pace, perhaps, too slow for his youthful energy, and had plunged into the vineyards. Of a sudden a young lion, - a term designating a lion between the age of a cub and a full-grown lion, - brought there, perhaps, in pursuit of the foxes or jackals, which often had their holes in vineyards (<a href="../../par/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>), roared against him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and <i>he had</i> nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord</span>, etc. - as a spirit of dauntless courage and irresistible strength of body. <span class="cmt_word">Came mightily</span>. Hebrew, <span class="accented">fell upon him</span>, or <span class="accented">passed</span> <span class="accented">over upon him</span>, as in ver. 19; 15:14; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">He rent him</span>, etc. He "had nothing in his hand," no weapon or knife, nor even a stick; but he rent him with as much ease as the kid is rent. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">the kid</span>, with the definite article, which is not prefixed unless some particular kid is meant, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/38-23.htm">Genesis 38:23</a>. Perhaps the kid means the one about to be served, which the cook rends open either before or after it is cooked. Unless some such operation is alluded to, it is not easy to understand what the rending of the kid means. <span class="cmt_word">He told not his father</span>, etc. This is mentioned to. explain ver. 16; but it shows that Samson had wandered some distance from his parents among the vineyards (see note to ver. 5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-7.htm">Judges 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went down</span>, as in ver. 1, where see note.

All the preliminaries being settled between the parents, he returned to Timnath to take his bride by the same road which he and his parents had travelled by before, and, remembering his feat in killing the lion, very naturally turned aside to see what had become of the carcase. <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there was a swarm of bees</span>, etc. This has been objected to as improbable, because bees are very dainty, and would not approach a putrefying body. But as a considerable time had elapsed, it is very possible that either the mere skeleton was left, or that the heat of the sun had dried up the body and reduced it to the state of a mummy without decomposition, as is said to happen often in the desert of Arabia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-9.htm">Judges 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And...  he went on eating</span>, etc. Compare the account of Jonathan finding and eating the wild honey (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25</a>, and following verses). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 14:10-20

It is not clear what is meant by this mention of his father alone; but it was probably some part of the wedding etiquette that the father should go to the bride first alone; perhaps, as Kimehi says, to give her notice of the bridegroom's approach, that she might get ready. Among the preparations may have been the selection of the thirty young men to be "the children of the bride-chamber" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>). As these were all Philistines, the inference is that they were selected by the bride, just as with us the bride has the privilege of choosing the minister who is to officiate at the marriage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they saw him</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the father and mother and friends of the bride saw him approaching, they went to meet him with the thirty companions who had been selected. We still see a strong resemblance to the wedding arrangements referred to in <a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, and Matthew 25:1-12; only in this case they were young men instead of young women who went out to meet the bridegroom. We may observe, by the way, that the scale of the wedding feast, as regards numbers and duration, indicates that Samson s family was one of wealth and position. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find <i>it</i> out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Riddle</span>.

In English, however, to <span class="accented">riddle</span>, as a verb active, means to <span class="accented">solve a riddle</span>, not, as in Hebrew, to propound one. The derivation of the Hebrew word and of the English is the same as regards the sense - something <span class="accented">intricate</span> and <span class="accented">twisted</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thirty sheets</span>, or rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">shirts</span>, a linen garment worn next the skin.

The word (<span class="accented">sadin</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">sindu</span>) means Indian linen. Change of garments - the outward garment of the Orientalist, which was part of the wealth of the rich and great, and was, and is to the present day, one of the most frequent presents on all state occasions (see <a href="../../par/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>, etc.).

There is some apparent difficulty in understanding how to reconcile this statement with what was said in ver. 14, that they could not in <span class="accented">three days</span> expound the riddle; and also with what is said in vers. 16 and 17, that Samson's wife <span class="accented">wept before him the seven days of the feast.</span> And several different readings have arisen from this difficulty: viz., in this verse, the reading of the <span class="accented">fourth</span> day for the <span class="accented">seventh</span>, and the omission of the words, <span class="accented">And it came to pass on the seventh day</span>; and, in the latter part of ver. 14, seven days for three days. But all difficulty will disappear if we bear in mind the peculiarity of Hebrew narrative noticed in note to section vers. 1-6 of ch. 2, when we come to consider ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Entice thy husband</span>. Cf. <a href="../../par/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That he may declare unto us</span>.

One stream of the narrative tells us what the young men did when Samson had propounded his riddle; the other tells us what Samson's wife did. From the very first, no doubt, she had wished to be in the secret, not perhaps from treacherous motives, but from curiosity, and the natural desire to be in her husband's confidence, and she pressed her request with cajolery and petulance. The young men at the same time had tried to find out the riddle by fair means. But on the seventh day they threatened to burn her and her father unless she found out the riddle for them, and under the terror of this threat she extracted the secret from Samson and divulged it to the Philistine young men. The only difficulty is to explain why a gap of four days occurs in the account between vers. 14 and 15. The most likely thing is, that after three days' vain attempt to find out the riddle, they began to tamper with Samson's wife, offering her money, as the Philistine lords did to Delilah (<a href="../../par/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), though the narrative does not mention it; but that on the seventh day, becoming desperate, and thinking that the woman was not doing her best, they resorted to the dreadful threat of burning her. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-17.htm">Judges 14:17</a></div><div class="verse">And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She lay sore upon him</span>.

This is the uncommon word for the sun used also in <a href="../../par/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">What is sweeter</span>, etc. They put their answer in a form to make it seem as if they had guessed the riddle; but Samson instantly perceived his wife's treachery, and showed that he did so by quoting the proverb of plowing with another person s heifer. They had not used their own wit to find out the riddle, but had learnt the secret at Samson's cost, through his wife. He insinuates that had they acted fairly he would have won the wager.

Ashkelon (<a href="../../par/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>) - one of the five Philistine cities, but the least often mentioned, owing, it is thought, to its remote situation "on the extreme edge of the shore of the Mediterranean, far down in the south." It still preserves its ancient name, and was famous in the time of the Crusaders. "Within the walls and towers now standing Richard (Coeur de Lion) held his court." The onion called eschalot, or shallot, is named from Eshkalon, or Ashkalon. <span class="cmt_word">Their spoil</span> - that which was stripped from them. <span class="cmt_word">His anger was kindled</span> - against the Philistines in general, and his wife in particular, so that he went back to his father s house without her.

The parents of the Thimnathite, having no doubt obtained Samson's dower, and supposing him to have finally broken with his treacherous wife, proceeded to give her in marriage to the Philistine young man who had been Samson's friend - perhaps the man to whom she had told the riddle. The sad end of this unhappy alliance fully justified the opposition of Samson's parents to it in ver. 3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
