The bulk of the tribe, as we read in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>, did receive their inheritance by lot before the death of Joshua (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 49) and Eleazar (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 51). But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity. This is in part accounted for by what we read <a href="../../par/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, that the Amorites would not suffer the children of Dan to come down to the valley, so that those who could not get possession of their land there would be crowded into other parts of the tribal territory. These Danites, of whom we are here reading, were dwelling in Zorah and Eshtaol (<a href="../../par/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1, 25</a>), as we see by vers. 2, 11. <span class="cmt_word">Unto that day</span>, etc. Translate this clause, <span class="accented">For unto that day</span> the land (meaning <span class="accented">the whole land</span>) <span class="accented">had not fallen unto them in the midst of the tribes of Israel for an inheritance.</span> The words <span class="accented">the land</span> must be supplied after the analogy of <a href="../../par/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>. What follows in this chapter is a more detailed account of what was briefly mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>, where, however, the A.V. <span class="accented">went out too little</span> for them is not a translation of the Hebrew text, which is very difficult to explain.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They came to Mount Ephraim</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/17-1.htm">Judges 17:1, 8</a>).

Micah's house seems to have been a collection of houses (vers. 14, 22), approached by one gateway (ver. 16), in one of which the Levite dwelt. <span class="cmt_word">They turned in thither</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that <i>were</i> therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and <i>there was</i> no magistrate in the land, that might put <i>them</i> to shame in <i>any</i> thing; and they <i>were</i> far from the Zidonians, and had no business with <i>any</i> man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Laish</span>.

The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, and in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> into <span class="accented">Lesem-dan.</span> St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Lesem Dan.</span> Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to. Tyre, on one of the sources of the Jordan. Robinson identifies it unhesitatingly with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Kady</span>, "the mount of the judge" (where <span class="accented">Kady</span> has the same meaning as <span class="accented">Dan</span>), close to the great fountain, "one of the largest fountains in the world," called <span class="accented">el-Leddan</span>, which is the source of the lesser Jordan (Josephus), and which may very possibly be the ultimate form of ed-Dan, corrupted into Eddan, el-Eddan, Led-dan, el-Leddan, by successive incorporations of the article <span class="accented">el</span> into the word itself, of which there are other examples. The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: "And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, '<span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, <span class="accented">and none doing any injury to any one in the land</span>, <span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man." The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word <span class="accented">dwelling</span> is in the feminine gender, agreeing with <span class="accented">people</span>, the words <span class="accented">quiet</span> and <span class="accented">secure</span> and <span class="accented">possessing</span> are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, "dwelling in security," "quiet and secure," and for the poetical character of the phrase "<span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>," and for the unusual form of the word here rendered <span class="accented">wealth</span> (<span class="accented">etzer</span> with an ain, instead of the usual <span class="accented">otzar</span> with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of <span class="accented">wealth</span> from <span class="accented">collecting</span>, from which the common word <span class="accented">atzereth</span> derives its meaning of a <span class="accented">collection</span> or <span class="accented">congregation</span> of people.

It would be better expressed in English by repeating <span class="accented">The children of Dan.</span> The repetition of the epithets <span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, as applied to the people of Laish, rather seems to indicate the writer's reprobation of the deed as cruel, like that of Simeon and Levi in slaying Hamor and Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">They smote them with the edge of the sword</span> - a phrase denoting an exterminating slaughter (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And they burnt the city</span>, etc. Perhaps they had made the people and city a <span class="accented">cherem</span>, a devoted thing, and therefore slew the one and burnt the other (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11</a>, etc.); or the burning of the city may have been one of the means by which they destroyed the people.

It is literally, <span class="accented">which belongeth to Beth-Rehob</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the valley here spoken of was part of the territory of the Syrians of Beth-Rehob in the time of David (and very likely earlier), as we read in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>. It seems to have taken its name, <span class="accented">House of Rehob</span>, from Rehob the father of Hadadezer, king of Zobah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>), and to have been called <span class="accented">Beth-Rehob</span> very much as Micah's settlement was called <span class="accented">Beth-Micah.</span> It was also called for shortness <span class="accented">Rehob</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>. It was situated, as we learn from <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, in the bounds of the tribe of Asher, in the extreme north of the Holy Land, near the entering in of Hamath, the site of which, however, is unknown (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>). The valley is that through which the Leddan fountain flows (ver. 7, note), and is the upper part of the plain called <span class="accented">el-Hulleh</span>, which is the northern continuation of the Jordan valley. <span class="cmt_word">They built a city</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">they rebuilt the city.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a></div><div class="verse">And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city <i>was</i> Laish at the first.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit Laish was the name</span>, etc. The strange form here given in the Septuagint, <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, arises from their having taken the Hebrew word for <span class="accented">howbeit</span> (<span class="accented">oulam</span>) as part of the name, and left out the L of Laish (see ver. 7, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Dan</span>, etc. It was probably the long existence of this semi-idolatrous worship of the graven image at Dan that induced King Jeroboam to set up one of his golden calves at Dan, as we read <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh</span>. The Hebrew text really has <span class="accented">the son of Moses.</span> But a little <span class="accented">n</span> is written above the line between the M and the S of Moses (Mosheh), so as to be read <span class="accented">Manasseh</span>, as thus: MSH; so that they avoided the pain of reading aloud that the grandson or descendant of Moses was an idolatrous priest, without actually altering the written text. It is indeed most sad that it should have been so, though like examples are not wanting, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the sons of Eli and of Samuel. For Gershom the son of Moses see <a href="../../par/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14-16</a>. It does not follow that Jonathan, the priest of the Danites, was literally the son of Gershom. It may merely mean that he was of the family of which Gershom was the head. <span class="cmt_word">Until the day of the captivity of the land</span>. There is great diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this phrase. Many understand it, as is the obvious meaning of the words, of the Assyrian captivity (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). But some of the best commentators, as Kimchi among the Jews, and many moderns, think it refers to the taking captive of the ark by the Philistines in the days of Eli, because this is the time indicated in the next verse by the mention of the house of God in Shiloh. The ark of God never returned to Shiloh after it was taken thence (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>) and captured by the Philistines (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 11). It is also noticed that the expression, <span class="accented">The ark of God is gone into captivity</span> (is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.), occurs in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21, 22</a>. It certainly would be strange that one verse (30) should speak of the worship of the graven image lasting till the Assyrian conquest of the land, and the next verse (31) limit it to the time that the house of God was in Shiloh, some 300 years earlier. At the same time it should be noticed that ver. 30 speaks of the time that Jonathan's sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, and ver. 31 of the worship of Micah's image. It is quite possible that the descendants of Jonathan may have been appointed priests at Dan to Jeroboam's golden-calf worship, though the original graven image of Micah may have been destroyed by Saul or David; and in the interval between such destruction of Micah's image and the setting up of Jeroboam's calves they may have been the priests of an irregular worship on a high place at Tell-el-Kady. And this would enable us to give what is certainly its natural meaning to the words, "the captivity of the land." But no certainty can be arrived at without more actual knowledge. Many commentators adopt Houbigant's conjecture to read <span class="accented">ark</span> for <span class="accented">land</span> at the end of ver. 30 (<span class="accented">aron</span> for <span class="accented">aretz</span>). Others think that some deportation of the Danites by the Syrians or other neighbouring people not recorded in history is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">All the time the house of God</span>, etc. This must have been written not earlier than the time of Samuel, and possibly much later. The house of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tabernacle, was in Shiloh from the days of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) till the days of Eli (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), after which we have no account of where the house of God was till the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by King David from the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), and placed in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>); but whether this was the tabernacle that had been pitched at Shiloh or a new one does not appear. It is not improbable that Samuel may have moved the tabernacle from Shiloh to Ramah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). The ark had rested in the house of Abinadab at Baaleh or Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>) previous to its removal by David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
