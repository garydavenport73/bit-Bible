But her father would not suffer him to go in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Within a while</span> - the same expression as that in <a href="../../par/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>, rendered "after a time," and in <a href="../../par/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4</a>, rendered "in process of time." <span class="cmt_word">In the time of wheat harvest</span> - about the month of May. The harvest, as appears from ver. 5, had begun, some corn being already cut, and in shocks; the rest still standing, and, being ready to be cut, of course extremely dry and inflammable. <span class="cmt_word">With a kid</span>, as a present, intended no doubt to make peace (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17</a>). His anger (<a href="../../par/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>) had now passed away, and his love for his wife had returned. He was little prepared to find her married again to his friend. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-2.htm">Judges 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: <i>is</i> not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not her younger sister</span>, etc. Samson's father-in-law might well have thought that Samson had forsaken his wife, and would never forgive her treachery. Possibly too he was a covetous man, and glad to get a second dower. Anyhow, his answer was conciliatory; but Samson was not in a mood to accept excuses, or be softened by conciliation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-3.htm">Judges 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I shall be more blameless than the Philistines</span>. The phrase rather means, <span class="accented">I shall be blameless</span> (or guiltless) <span class="accented">before the Philistines</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in relation to the Philistines,  - they will have nothing to lay to my charge; my revenge will be a just one, - as in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-22.htm">Numbers 32:22</a>: Then <span class="accented">shall ye be guiltless before the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">and be. fore Israel.</span> He means that so grievous an injury as he had received in having his wife taken from him and given to a Philistine will justify any requitals on his part. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Foxes</span>. The word here rendered <span class="accented">fox</span> (<span class="accented">shu'al</span>, in Persian <span class="accented">shagal</span>, which is etymologically the same word as <span class="accented">jackal</span>) includes the jackal, which is as common in Palestine as the fox. Here, and in <a href="../../par/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>, the gregarious jackals, the canis <span class="accented">aureus</span>, are undoubtedly meant. <span class="cmt_word">Caught</span>. The Hebrew word means especially <span class="accented">caught in nets</span> or snares. See <a href="../../par/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> (have <span class="accented">taken</span> nothing at all); <a href="../../par/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a> (let his net catch himself); <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-22.htm">Jeremiah 18:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> (<span class="accented">taken</span>), etc. And it is in this sense that the A.V. uses the word <span class="accented">caught</span>. A clever sportsman, as no doubt Samson was, would have no difficulty whatever in netting or snaring 300 jackals, which always move in packs, and would be attracted by the vineyards of Thimnathah, for which their partiality is well known (see <a href="../../par/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>, note). The writer of the additional article <span class="accented">Fox</span> in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' states that he had tried the experiment of throwing grapes to the foxes, jackals, and wolves in the Zoological Gardens. The wolves would not touch them, the others ate them with avidity. <span class="cmt_word">Took firebrands</span>, etc. Many cavils have been directed against the truth of this account, but without the slightest reason. The terrified animals, with the burning torches and the blazing straw behind them, would necessarily run forwards. Samson would, of course, start the couples at numerous different points, and no doubt have a number of Hebrews to assist him. To the present day the corn-fields in that part of the <span class="accented">Shephelah</span> extend continuously for twenty or thirty miles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-5.htm">Judges 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had set the brands on fire, he let <i>them</i> go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards <i>and</i> olives.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shocks and the standing corn</span>. See ver. 1, note. <span class="cmt_word">With the vineyards and olives</span>. The Hebrew text has <span class="accented">the orchards of olive trees - the</span> word <span class="accented">cherem</span>, usually translated <span class="accented">vineyard</span>, meaning also any <span class="accented">orchard</span>; but the Septuagint in both codices supplies and, as does the A. Y., which gives the more probable sense, <span class="accented">vineyards and olives.</span> It is unlikely that the vineyards should not be mentioned, in a district abounding in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Philistines...  burnt her and her father with fire</span>. See <a href="../../par/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>. It appears from <a href="../../par/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15, 25</a>, that burning with fire was a judicial punishment among the Hebrews. Possibly the Philistines, in their fear of Samson, and perhaps also from a rude sense of justice, inflicted this punishment upon the Thimnathite and her father as the real authors of the destruction of their corn-fields, by giving Samson so unheard-of provocation. Note the fact of the identical fate overtaking Samson's wife which she had sought to escape by base treachery (cf. <a href="../../par/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> with what actually happened). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson said</span>, etc. There are two ways of understanding Samson's speech: one, with the A.V., as meaning to say that though the Philistines had taken his part, and repudiated all fellowship in the shameful deed of the Thimnathite and her father, yet he would have his full revenge upon them; the other, translating the particle in its more common sense of if, makes him say, "If this is the way you treat me, be sure I will not cease till I have had my full revenge." This is perhaps on the whole the most probable meaning. It still leaves it uncertain whether the Philistines meant to do Samson justice, or to do him an additional injury, by putting his wife and her father to death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote them hip and thigh</span>, etc. A proverbial expression, the origin of which is uncertain; it means, he smote them with a great and complete slaughter. It is reasonable to suppose that he had gathered a few Hebrews round him to help him. <span class="cmt_word">He went down</span>, etc. This shows that <span class="accented">Etam</span> must have been situated lower than Tinmath, and seems to preclude its identification with <span class="accented">Urtas</span>, in the hill country of Judah, between Bethlehem and Tekoah, which apparently represents the <span class="accented">Etam</span> of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>. But there is another Etam in the tribe of Simeon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>), which may possibly be the Etam of our text. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the rock</span>. Rather, the <span class="accented">cleft or fissure</span> of the rock  -  some narrow and inaccessible ravine. The site has not been identified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 15:9-20 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went up</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their own country in the Shephelah to the hill country of Judah. As Samson had avenged his wrongs on the whole Philistine people, so they now came up to Judah to take vengeance for Samson's injuries. <span class="cmt_word">In Lehi</span>, or, rather, <span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, <span class="accented">the Lehi</span>, the place afterwards so called, as related in vers. 17 and 20 (see <a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>, note). Lehi has been identified by some with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Lekhiyeh</span>, four miles above Beer-sheba; and by others with <span class="accented">Beit-Likiyeh</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the Wady Suleiman, two miles below the upper Beth-heron, and so within easy distance of Timnath and other places mentioned in the history of Samson. But no certainty can at present be arrived at. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-10.htm">Judges 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-11.htm">Judges 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines <i>are</i> rulers over us? what <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done unto us?

It is rather <span class="accented">three thousand men went down from Judah</span>, showing that the rock Etam was below. <span class="cmt_word">The top</span>. It should be the <span class="accented">cleft</span>, as in ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou not</span>, etc. The language of these cowardly men shows how completely the Philistine yoke was fastened upon the necks of Judah. The history gives no account of the Philistine conquest; except the brief allusion in <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6, 7</a>; but Samson's story brings to light the existence of it. The abject state to which they were reduced is shown By their complaint of Samson, What is this that thou hast done unto us?" instead of hailing him as a deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">As they did unto me</span>, etc. It is instructive to read Samson's defence of himself in the very words used by the Philistines in ver. 10. "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." There is no end to rendering "evil for evil." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-12.htm">Judges 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.

There is something very base in this deliberate agreement with their Philistine masters to deliver up Samson bound into their hands. But it is not very unlike the spirit in which the Hebrews looked upon Moses when he first began to work to rescue them from their Egyptian bondage (<a href="../../par/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25-28</a>). Samson's forbearance towards his own countrymen is commendable. <span class="cmt_word">Brought him up</span> - from the deep ravine or cleft in which he was hid. His place of concealment was probably unknown to the Philistines, or may be they had quite a superstitious fear of Samson from their experience of his prowess.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a></div><div class="verse">And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - A most vivid and stirring description! The Spirit of the Lord (<a href="../../par/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>), with that suddenness which marks his extraordinary movements (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>, etc.), came upon Samson, and mightily strengthened him in his outer man. The strong new cords snapped asunder in an instant, and before the Philistines could recover from their terror at seeing their great enemy free, he had snatched up the heavy jawbone of an ass recently dead, and with it smote the flying Philistines till a thousand of them had fallen under his blows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-16.htm">Judges 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson said</span>, etc. The exploit gave birth to one of Sam son's punning, enigmatical, sayings: "With <span class="accented">the jawbone of the ass</span>, <span class="accented">one heap</span>, <span class="accented">two heads</span> of slain." <span class="accented">Hamor</span>, an ass, means also <span class="accented">an heap</span>. If one were to imitate the passage in English, supposing that the jaw of a sheep had been the implement, it might run something like this - By <span class="accented">the jaw of a sheep they fell heap upon heap.</span> A Latin imitation is, <span class="accented">Maxilla cervi</span>, <span class="accented">acervum acervos</span> (Bochart).

The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that <span class="accented">God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi</span> (<span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name <span class="accented">En-hakkorch</span>, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) <span class="accented">hollow place</span> (ham-<span class="accented">maktesh</span>) means a <span class="accented">mortar</span>; also the <span class="accented">cavity in the jaw</span> from which the molar teeth grow. The hollow ground from which the spring rose, with which Samson quenched his thirst, from its shape and from the connection with <span class="accented">hal-Lechi</span> (the jawbone) was called <span class="accented">hammaktech.</span> In <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a> it is also a proper name, apparently of some spot near Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The name thereof</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the fountain, with which <span class="accented">thereof</span>, which is in the feminine gender, agrees. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Lehi unto this day</span>. This punctuation does not agree with the Hebrew accents, which put a strong stop after <span class="accented">Lehi</span>. The Hebrew accents rather convey the sense that the name <span class="accented">En</span>-<span class="accented">kakkoreh</span> continued to be the name of the well unto the day of the writer.

It looks as if it had been the intention to close the history of Samson with these Words, but that ch. 16. was subsequently added, possibly from other sources. Compare the close of chs. 20. and 21. of the Gospel of St. John. A possible explanation, however, of this verse being placed here is that it results from the statement in ver. 19, that Samson's spirit came again, and he revived, or came to life again, after being on the very point of death; and, adds the writer, he judged Israel after this for twenty years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
