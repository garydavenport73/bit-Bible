Dean Stanley, in his 'Sinai and Palestine,' as well as in his 'Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church,' describes this portion of the Book of Judges as the 'Domes. day Book' of the land of Canaan, and the remark has been constantly repeated. There is, however, a considerable difference between the great survey of the Conqueror and this one. The former was an accurate account, for purposes of taxation, national detente, and public order, of the exact extent of soil owned by each landowner, and it went so far as to enumerate the cattle on his estate, to the great disgust of the Saxon chronicler, who had an Englishman's dislike of inquisitorial proceedings. There is no trace either of such completeness, or of such an inquisitorial character in this survey, neither has it quite the same object. It assigns to each tribe the limits of its future possessions, and enumerates the cities contained in each portion of territory. Bat it makes scarcely any effort to describe the possessions of particular families, still less of individual landowners. Joshua and Caleb are the only exceptions. Knobel observes that the most powerful tribes were first settled in their territory - those, namely, of Judah and Joseph. He remarks that the author must have had written sources for his information, for no single Israelite could have been personally acquainted with all the details here given. <span class="cmt_word">And stricken in years.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">advanced in age.</span> There is no foundation for the idea of some commentators that the Jews, at the time this book was written, made any formal distinction in these words between different stages of old age. The Hebrew language rejoiced in repetition, and this common phrase is only a means of adding emphasis to the statement already made. <span class="cmt_word">And there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> is stronger than our version. Perhaps the best equivalent in modern English is, <span class="accented">"And the amount of land that remaineth for us to occupy is very great indeed."</span> We may observe here that, as with the literal so with the spiritual Israel, whether the antitype be the Christian Church or the human heart, the work of subduing God's enemies is gradual. One successful engagement does not conclude the war. The enemy renews his assaults, and when force fails he tries fraud; when direct temptations are of no avail he resorts to enticements. The only safeguard in the war is strength, alertness, courage, patience. The faint hearted and unwatchful alike fail in the contest, which can be carried on successfully only by him who has learned to keep guard over himself, and to direct his ways by the counsels of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the land which yet remaineth</span>. The powerful league of the Philistines, as well as the tribes near them, remained unsubdued. In the north, likewise, the neighbourhood of Sidon, and the territory of Coele, Syria, which lay between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, was as yet in the hands of the enemy. Rabbis Kimchi and Solomon Jarchi translate by "borders." Masius suggests the French <span class="accented">marque</span> (which was the old German <span class="accented">mark</span>), and the modern German <span class="accented">grenze.<span class="cmt_word"></span> All the borders of the Philistines.</span> Literally, all the <span class="accented">circles</span> (Geliloth) of the Philistines. The expression is found in several places in this book (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10, 11</a>). We may compare the expression the <span class="accented">circles</span> of Swabia, Franconia, <span class="accented">etc</span>., in the history of Germany. The expression here may have more affinity with what is known as the "mark system" in the history of ancient Germany, and refer to the patch of cultivated ground which extended for some distance round each city. But this is rendered improbable by the fact that one circle only retained its name (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>), and is still known as Galilee (see notes on these passages). Galilee was too large a district to have been originally a clearing round a town. <span class="cmt_word">Geshur</span> (see note on Joshua 12:5). Ewald (see also Hitzig,' Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) conjectures that these Geshurites were the aboriginal inhabitants of the country (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>), and were the same as the Avites or Avvites. See next verse, where the Avvites are distinguished from the five lords of the Philistines. It is worthy of remark that the name Talmai, the name of one of the "sons of Anak" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>), comes in again as the name of a king of Geshur (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a> 13:37). It occurs, however, as a Hebrew name in Bartholomew, or Bar-Tolmai, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the son of Talmai, or Tolmai, one of the twelve apostles. Ewald supposes that these aborigines were dispossessed by the Canaanitish tribes, and that the old name of Geshur was still applied to those regions on which this primitive race had retained its hold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">From Sihor, which <i>is</i> before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, <i>which</i> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Sihor.</span> This word, which has the article in Hebrew, is literally <span class="accented">the black river.</span> This has been thought to be the Nile, known to both Greeks and Latins by that title. The Greeks called it <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. So Virgil says of it, "AEgyptum nigra foecundat arena." The Vulgate has "a fluvio turbido qui irrigat AEgyptum." The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The phrase which is "before" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Egypt seems to exclude the idea of the Nile, since the Nile flowed through the centre of Egypt, and it is impossible to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. As Drusins remarks, moreover, the Nile is always called either <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> or "the river of Egypt." The interpreation which has found most favour of late, therefore, refers this expression to a small river that flows into the sea at the extreme southern border of Palestine. This river was known as the "river of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and is now called the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arisch</span> (cf. also <a href="../../par/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4, 47</a>, as well as <a href="../../par/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">nahal</span>, or <span class="accented">winter torrent</span>, a word inapplicable to the Nile). For Sihor, or Shichor, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and especially <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>, which seems decisive against the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">Which is counted to the Canaanite.</span> These words are connected by the Masorites with what follows: <span class="accented">The five lords of the Philistines are reckoned to the Canaanite.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The five lords of the Philistines.</span> The Philistines (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-12.htm">1 Chronicles 1:12</a>) are supposed to be of Egyptian origin. Ewald (also Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) believes Caphtor to be Crete, and supposes the Cherethites and Pelethites who formed David's body-guard (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) to be Cretans and Philistines (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). But this opinion is disputed by many commentators of note, and is far from probable in itself. They were David's most trusted and faithful troops, and it seems hardly probable that so truly national a monarch would have assigned the post of honour around his person to the hereditary enemies of his race. Ritter, however, believes the Cherethites and Pelethites to be Philistines, and appeals to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, and still more forcibly to <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4, 5</a>. It should be remembered, too, that Ittai was a Gittite, or native of Gath (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>). The term here used, translated <span class="accented">lords</span> (<span class="accented">satraps</span>, LXX.), is peculiar to the Philistines. It is to be found also in <a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> the word means an <span class="accented">axle</span>, or perhaps the outside plating of the wheel, and in the kindred languages it signifies a wheel. The expression is remarkable in connection with the phrase "circles of the Philistines." <span class="cmt_word">The Eshkalalonites.</span> The inhabitants of Ashkelon, as the Gittites are of Gath. <span class="cmt_word">Also the Avites.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">the Avites."</span> There is no "also" in the original, though the Avites or Avim are supposed (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and note on Geshuri in the last verse)to have been aborigines preceding the Canaanites, and dispossessed by the Philistines. Keil, however, disputes this view, and holds that we have no evidence that any but a Canaanitish people dwelt in southwestern Palestine. This Canaanitish tribe, he thinks, was driven out by the Philistines. Some few of the Avites, or rather Avvites, continued to dwell among their conquerors. But the coincidence between <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22, 23</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, makes strongly for Ewald's view above. And Keil and Delitzsch, in their later joint work, incline to it. See Introduction III. The word Avvim, like Havoth, or Havvoth (see ver. 30), is supposed to mean villages, or inhabited enclosures. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-4.htm">Joshua 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that <i>is</i> beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the south.</span> The LXX. and the best modern commentators connect these words with what precedes. This gives a better sense than joining it to what follows. For the south was not "all the land of the Canaanites," but a large part of it belonged, as we have just seen, to a tribe not of Canaanitish origin, while the land of the Canaanites (see note on Joshua 3:10) extended far to the northward. Therefore we must understand the words "all the land of the Canaanites" to begin a fresh section, and to be descriptive of the territory extending from Philistia northward towards Sidon. So the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic. <span class="cmt_word">Mearah</span>. The margin has "the cave." But there is no article in the original The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> for Mearah, having clearly, as Masius observes, substituted Zain for Resh. But this mistaken reading compels a mistranslation of the passage. Vandevelde supposes it to be a remarkable cave still existing near Sidon, which is mentioned by William of Tyre as having been fortified by the Crusaders. He speaks of it as <span class="accented">municipium quoddam</span>, and states that it was commonly known as the "cave of Tyre." "spelunca inexpugnabilis." It was afterwards "the last retreat of the Emir Fakkr-ed-Din" (Vandevelde, s.v. Mearah). There is a village now, north of Sidon, called Mog-heiriyeh, or the village of the cave. So also Kuobel. <span class="cmt_word">Beside the Sidonians.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">near</span>, or <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, or <span class="accented">which belong to the</span> Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek</span>. Or <span class="accented">Aphekah.</span> This (Knobel) was the northern Aphek (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-30.htm">Joshua 19:30</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>), in the tribe of Asher, known later as Aphaca, and now as Afka. Not the Aphekah of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>, probably the Aphek of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>. It is the same Aphek which in later times was captured by the Syrians, and was the scene of several decisive victories of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>). It is doubtful which Aphek is meant in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>, though it is probably the southern Aphek. The situation is described as one of "rare beauty" (Delitzsch), "on the northwest slopes of Lebanon," amid exquisite groves (Conder). Here the Syrian Astarte was worshipped, and the ruins of her temple, dedicated to her as mourning for Tammuz, or Adonis, may still be seen. See Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' 310,311, and Mover's 'Die Phonizier,' 1:192. Perhaps it was never actually occupied by the Asherites, but remained in the hands of Syria, and as a place of great resort was the natural point to which the attacks of Israel would be directed. Vandevelde, however, believes in four and Conder in <span class="accented">seven</span> cities of this name, and they suppose the Aphek which was the scene of the battle with the Syrians to have been on the east of Jordan, from the occurrence of the word "Mishor" in the narrative in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>. The term "Mishor" is, however, applied to other places beside the territory east of Jordan (see Gesenius, s.v. Mishor). The Aphek in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a> cannot be identified with any that have been named. <span class="cmt_word">To the borders of the Amorites.</span> This can hardly be anything but the northern border of the kingdom of Bashan, in the neighbourhood of Mount Hermon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Giblites.</span> The inhabitants of Gebal, called Jebail (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hill city, from <span class="accented">Jebel</span>) by the Arabs, and Byblus by the Greeks. This is Masius's idea, and other commentators have accepted it (see 1 Kings 5:32; <a href="../../par/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, where the LXX. translates by Byblus). In the first named passage the word is translated "stone squarers," in our version (where it is the 18th and not the 32nd verse). All the other versions render "Giblites" as here, and no doubt the inhabitants of the Phoenician city of Jebail are meant, since in the ruins of Jebail the same kind of masonry is found as is seen in Solomon's temple. Byblus (Kenriek, 'Phoenicia,' l.c. Movers, l.c. Lenormant, 'Manual of the History of the East,' if. 223) was the great seat of the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis. Here his father Cinyras was supposed to have been king, and the licentious worship, with its corrupting influences, was spread over the whole region of Lebanon and even Damascus. This territory was never actually occupied by the Israelites (see for this passage also <a href="../../par/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8, 17</a>; and Joshua 12:7). <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. The spies penetrated nearly as far as this (Numbers 42:21), and David reduced the land into subjection as far as the borders of this territory. But the Israelites never subdued it. Toi, king of Hamath, was an ally, not a tributary of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>). The border of Israel is always described as extending "to the entering in of Hamath" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), though Jeroboam II. is said to have "recovered" (v. 28) Hamath itself. This "entering in of Hamath" commences at the end of the region called Coele Syria, according to Robinson, 'Later Biblical Researches,' see. 12, at the northeast end of the Lebanon range. So Vandevelde and Porter. Vandevelde remarks that the expression refers to an "entrance formed by Nature herself," namely, the termination of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges. The city of Hamath, which gave its name to the territory, is situated on the Orontes, and was known later as Epiphaneia, no doubt after Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria.

A large portion of the Sidonian territory was taken, but Sidon retained its independence (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31, 32</a>). It is clear, too, that the promise was conditional.

But as <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> stands in our version, the city referred to stood in the middle of the <span class="accented">river of Gad.</span> This would suggest the idea that the old derivation of Aroer by Wells and others from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (city) doubled, with the signification of the <span class="accented">double city</span>, is nearer the mark than that of <span class="accented">wasteness</span>, or <span class="accented">desolateness</span>, or nakedness, as of a region bare of trees, which has found favour of late, and it is not without support in Hebrew forms. A city, moreover, in the midst of or "on the brink of" a winter torrent would be less likely to be waste or desolate than in other situations. But we are not yet at the end of our difficulties. The word Nahal, which comes before Gad in the passage of which we are now speaking, has the article. Thus the translation, "river of Gad" cannot be maintained. And besides, the enumeration of the people must have begun at the Arnon, or southern border of Israel beyond Jordan. It is possible that the text may be corrupt here, as it is in other parts of 2 Samuel, and possibly the meaning may be that the officers pitched in Aroer, passed through Reuben, and having come within the confines of Gad arrived at Jazer. This again is rendered doubtful by the close connection of Aroer and Jazer in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. It is of course, therefore, possible that the reference in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>. is to the Jabbok, not the Arnon ravine. A question, of such intricacy can only be Settled, if settled at all, by an investigation on. the spot. <span class="cmt_word">The plain.</span> The word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. This derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> signifies level ground, and is applied to the region north of Moab, especially that part of it which belonged to Reuben. Flat, and almost unbroken, even by trees, it was particularly adapted for grazing land (see also note above, and on ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Medeba</span>. This is mentioned in Scripture, together with Dibon, as here in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. It was on the level ground before mentioned (see Gesenius, s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). Dibon (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>, called Dimon in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>; but Dibon in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; see also <a href="../../par/numbers/33-45.htm">Numbers 33:45, 46</a>). It was one of the cities built by the children of Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>). It is now called Dhiban, and is a short distance north of the Arnon. The Moabite stone, found at Dibon in 1868, mentions the occupation of Medeba by Omri, and implies that Dibon, the principal city in those parts, was also subject to him, but recovered finally by Mesha.

Like the clergy under the Christian dispensation, it was seen that they could not at once perform the duties of the priesthood, and act as instructors of the people, if they were burdened, like the rest, with the duty of carrying on war. Their place was supplied by the division of the tribe of Joseph into two, so that the inheritance of Israel was still divided among twelve tribes. Bahr, in his 'Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 2:48, 49, gives other reasons for the dispersion of the Levites throughout the land. If the Levites were to keep the Law and Word of God, to take measures for its being properly kept by the nation in general, to spread abroad a knowledge of the precepts of the religion of Israel, to stir up the tribes to a devout and religious life, it was not merely desirable, but absolutely necessary, that they should be scattered among the tribes. On the other hand, to secure a proper <span class="accented">esprit de corps</span>, a mutual sustaining influence, and a common action, too complete a dispersion would have been a mistake. Hence their collection into the Levitical cities, which, however (see note on Joshua 21:11), were not given up wholly to them. The Divine wisdom which dictated the provisions of the Mosaic law is clearly visible here. The instinct of the Christian Church in early times devised a similar provision for the evangelisation of the people in the organisation of the ancient and mediaeval cathedrals. <span class="cmt_word">As he said unto them.</span> This quotation of <a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20, 24</a> by a later writer would, under all ordinary circumstances, be regarded as a proof that the Book of Joshua was quoting one of the books of Moses. But the "Elohistic" and "Jehovistic" theory escapes this conclusion in the cumbrous fashion to which reference has been already made. Origen regards this passage as symbolical of the more spiritually earnest among the laity, who" so excel others invirtue of mind and grace of merits, as that the Lord should be called their inheritance." "How very rare," he says, "are those who devote themselves to wisdom and knowledge and preserve their mind clear and pure, and exercise their minds in all excellent virtues, who illuminate the way wherein they walk for simpler souls by the grace of learning, and thus attain to salvation. They are the true priests and Levites, whose inheritance is the Lord, who is wisdom" (Hom. 17 on Joshua). <span class="cmt_word">The Sacrifices.</span> The word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">fire.</span> It does not itself, as Keil asserts, <span class="accented">signify</span> <span class="accented">fire</span> in any place in Holy Writ, but it is used of the shewbread in <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7, 9</a>. It thus came to mean any sacrifice, whether offered by fire or not. And thus the tenth which (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21, 23, 24</a>) was given to the Levites, as being offered for God's service, might be reckoned as in some sense a sacrifice. With this passage we may compare various passages in the New Testament, where, in this respect at least, the Christian ministry stands on the same footing (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6, 7</a>). Thus the maintenance of the Christian ministry is a kind of sacrifice - as we find such deeds called, in fact, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>. And an order of men who are set apart to the ministry of souls has a right to claim a sufficient maintenance at the hands of those to whom they minister - a point which in these days of affluence and clerical destitution combined ought to be more largely recognised than it is (see <a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). "For the law is entrusted to the priests and Levites, and they devote their energies to this alone, and without any anxiety are able to give their time to the Word of God. But that they may be able to do this, they ought to depend upon the support of the laity. For if the laity do not allow the priests and Levites all the necessaries of life, they would be obliged, to engage themselves in temporal occupations, and would thus have less time for the law of God. And when they had no time to spare for the study of God's law, it is thou who wouldst be in danger. For the light of knowledge that is in them would grow dim, because thou hast given no oil for the lamp, and through thy fault it would come to pass, what the Lord said, 'If the blind lead the blind, shall they not both fall into the ditch?'" (Orig., Hom. 17 on Joshua). These words are well worthy of attention now, when a multiplicity of worldly business and a weight of worldly cares are devolved upon God's ministers by a laity which has to too great an extent washed its hands of all cooperation in the work of God's Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben <i>inheritance</i> according to their families.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Reuben</span>. This passage is an expansion of <a href="../../par/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33-42</a>. We learn from it that the Israelites actually took possession of this land. But in the reigns of the wicked kings Omri and Ahab the power of Israel declined, and after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and the defeat and death of Ahab, the Moabites succeeded in shaking off the Israelitish yoke, and in wresting from Israel moreover a considerable portion of the territory of Sihon. In the next reign an attempt was made to regain possession of the lost territory. We learn from the Moabite stone that the important towns here mentioned, Medeba, Dibon, Baalmeon, Kiriathaim (or Kirjathalm, as it is here called), Ataroth, Nebo, Aroer, had fallen into the hands of Mesha at the rebellion, and that he had erected a citadel at Dibon, which had become his capital. Hence the endeavour to invade Moab from the south, recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a>, which, however, though successful as a military promenade, was attended with no permanent results. For Isaiah (ch. 15.)and Jeremiah (ch. 48.) mention most of these places, as well as Elealeh and Heshbon, the former capital of Sihon, as being strongholds of the Moabite power. Jahaz, too, the place where Sihon gave battle of the Israelites, is numbered by Mesha, as well as at a later date by Isaiah and Jeremiah, among the possessions of Moab; while Horonaim, mentioned among the Moabite cities by the two prophets, is incidentally noticed by Mesha as having been captured from the Edomites. In this early extinction of the tribe of Reuben we may see the fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<a href="../../par/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The plain by Medeba.</span> See ver. 10; so again in the next verse.

Such touches as this, which display the minute acquaintance of our author with his subject, are almost of a necessity lost in a translation. But where our version has "plain," the original has Mishor when the uplands of Gilead and Bashan are meant, Arabah when the writer is speaking of the Wadys in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, Shephelah when he refers to the lowlands of Western palestine, bordering on the Mediterranean, Bik'ah when he speaks of the great valley of Coele Syria, Ciccar when he speaks of the territory due north of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">With the princes of Midian.</span> The word here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> signifies <span class="accented">exalted persons</span>, persons of rank, as we should say. It would seem to imply rather civil functions than the more absolute authority which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> also rendered "prince" in Hebrew, carries with it. With this passage compare <a href="../../par/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>. The Hebrew has no "with," so that the difficulty some have found in the passage need not have arisen. It is nowhere said that Moses smote the "princes of Midian" together with Sihon. All that is stated is that they, as well as Sihon, were smitten, as the history in Numbers tells us they were. Dukes of Sihon. According to Gesenius, Rosenmiiller, and others, the word here translated "dukes" is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">to pour out</span>, means "anointed." See Psalm if. 6, where it is translated "set." But Keil rejects this interpretation, and says that the word never signifies to anoint. It is always used, he says, of <span class="accented">foreign</span> princes. But he has overlooked <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> (Hebrews). See Knobel, who explains it of drink offerings, and regards these "dukes" as men pledged by a solemn treaty to be Sihon's allies, though not vassals. Kimchi thinks that Sihon, before his reverses at the hand of Israel, had held some authority in Midian, and these were his prefects, or under-kings. The term is applied to Zebah and Zalmunna in <a href="../../par/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> (in the Hebrew).

The LXX. translates, "And the borders of Reuben were the Jordan-border." This seems to be the meaning of the original.

Knobel's explanation is probably the correct one, that the phrase means to refer to the natural boundary marked out by the river or sea and its banks. "The boundary of the children of Reuben was Jordan and the natural boundary thus formed." As Dean Stanley reminds us in his 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Reuben, as predicted by Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), sank at once into insignificance.

In the primitive villages of Servia, where wild beasts are not entirely extirpated, not only are all the homesteads enclosed, but a fence is placed across the road, and removed when a vehicle has to pass through. Or perhaps the primitive Jewish community was similar to the primitive Teutonic community as described by Marshall in his 'Elementary and Practical Treatise on Landed Property,' published in 1804, who described the early distribution of land in this country as follows: "Round the village lay a few small enclosures for rearing young stock. Further a field the best land for arable purposes was chosen, and divided into three parts, for the necessary, rotation of fallow, wheat or rye, and spring crops. The meadows near the water courses were set aside for the growth of fodder for the cattle or for pasturage for milch cows, <span class="accented">etc</span>. The irreclaimable lands were left for what we now call 'common' uses for fuel, and the inferior pasturage." These arrangements are found to exist in India (see Sir H. Maine, 'Village Communities,' sec. 4.). But there, as in Palestine, the necessity for water was the cause of important modifications.

Conder, however, thinks the two are distinct places, and fixes Ramoth-Mizpeh on the north border of Gad, about 25 reties west of Bozrah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span> The dual of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;</span> <span class="accented">two hosts</span> or <span class="accented">camps.</span> It received its name from Jacob, who with his own company met the angels of God, and who commemorated the meeting by this name (see <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>).

While both inhabited a similar tract of country, a country from its open and pastoral character likely to develop a hardy and healthy race of men, the Reubenites were exposed to the seductions of the Moabitish worship of Chemosh, which, when combined with an ancestral temperament by no means prone to resist such influences (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), soon proved fatal to a tribe, itself not numerous (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>), and hemmed in on every side but the north by the unbelievers. The temperament inherited by the Gadites added to their more favourable situation and the nature of their pursuits, developed a hardy and warlike race ready to do battle, and fearless of their foes (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>). Of this tribe came the valiant Jephthah, and of it also came the brave soldiers of David, whose qualifications stir to poetry the sober chronicler of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). We may see here the influence of circumstances on the character of a people. Originally (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>) the Reubenites and the Gadites were alike. But the Reubenites, as we have seen, from unfavourable surroundings, lost the character which the Gadites, more favourably situated, were enabled to preserve. And the distinctions of tribes, producing as they did a separate <span class="accented">esprit de corps in</span> each tribe, will serve to explain why one tribe did not immediately succumb to influences which proved fatal to another. In the end, as we know, all the people of Gad fell victims to the temptations which surrounded them, and, save in the case of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin, and the few faithful Israelites who went over to them, irrevocably. The same phenomenon may be observed in the history of nations generally. As long as their manners were simple and their morals pure, they have preserved their liberty, and in many cases have acquired empire. As soon as their bodies were enervated by luxury, and their minds corrupted by vice, they fell a prey to foes whom formerly they would have despised. Thus fell the Greek and Boman republics, thus the Britons became an easy prey to the Saxons, and the Saxons to the Danes. In every instance the history of a tribe and of a nation serves to illustrate the maxim that "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses gave <i>inheritance</i> unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and <i>this</i> was <i>the possession</i> of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The halftribe of Manasseh.</span> The word used for "tribe" in the first and second half of this verse is not the same. Some German critics have derived an argument for the hypothesis that the historical and geographical portions of the book are not by the same hand, from the supposed fact that the former of these words is used almost exclusively in the first, or historical portion, and the latter in the second, or geographical portion, of the book. The word "almost" would be <span class="accented">almost</span> sufficient to overthrow the theory, but this verse is an insuperable objection to it. Is it seriously contended that one half of this verse is taken from one author, and the other from another? Or is it possible that the writer of the book may actually have understood the language he was using, and meant to use the two words in somewhat different senses? Gesenius, it is true, would explain the words as being precisely synonymous. But his own etymological remarks are fatal to his theory. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> the latter of the two words, is a <span class="accented">bough</span>, or <span class="accented">shoot</span> (derived from a word signifying to <span class="accented">grow</span>), capable of throwing out blossoms (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a>). It refers, therefore, to the natural descent of the tribe from Manasseh their father. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is allied to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>; to judge, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the English <span class="accented">shaft</span>, and signifies a rod as the emblem of authority. Thus it is used in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, of a royal sceptre. So <a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, an iron sceptre, <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. Thus the latter word has reference to the tribe as an organised community, the former to it in reference to its ancestral derivation. This view would seem to be supported by ver. 24, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> of Gad is further explained to mean his <span class="accented">sons and their families</span>, as well as by this verse, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is used absolutely, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> in connection with the family

So we use the phrase "five," as synonymous with "dwell." Why the term is confined to these particular cities is not known. Gesenius regards it as equivalent to "nomadic encampment." But the ruins of the giant cities of Bashan, recently rediscovered in our own time (by Mr. Cyril Graham, in 1857), and displaying all the signs of high civilisation, dispose of this idea. These cities are mentioned in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a> as "threescore cities, all the region of Argob," and again in ver. 13, "all the region of Argob with all Bashan, which is called the land of giants." "To the east he (Abraham) would leave the barren and craggy fatnesses of the formidable Argob, still (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Abraham's time, not Joshua's) the asylum of the fiercest outlaws; and would jealously avoid the heathen haunts in groves and on high places where smoke arose to the foul image, and the frantic dance swept round." (Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 69. See also note on 'Judah upon Jordan,' <a href="../../par/joshua/19-34.htm">Joshua 19:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Threescore cities</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>). It was the martial character, as well as the half tribe of Manasseh, that qualified him to receive and subdue this important territory with its wide extent and teeming population. In the article on Manasseh in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' reference is made to the fact that, while Ephraim only sent 20,800, and Western Manasseh 18,000, Reuben, Gad, and Eastern Manasseh sent the immense number of 120,000, and this while Abner, the supporter of Ishbosheth, had his headquarters at Mahanaim. But the numbers are suspicious, especially when Judah, always a powerful tribe, comes below the insignificant tribe of Simeon in number. And a comparison of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a> with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22, 23</a>, would lead to the idea that the coronation of David after the death of Ishbosheth is the event referred to (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38-40</a>).
