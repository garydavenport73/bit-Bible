No human words ever written have brought such comfort to millions of mourners as the words of this chapter, which form a part of the Burial Service of almost every Christian community. It is the more deeply imprinted on the memory of men because it comes to us in the most solemn hours of bereavement, when we have most need of a living faith.

The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of the original merely marks the transition to a new topic. <span class="cmt_word">The gospel</span>.

Some officious scribes have in some manuscripts altered the word into" the eleven."

To witness to the Resurrection was a main function of "the twelve" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40</a>, etc.).

The "James" intended is undoubtedly the only James then living, who was known to the whole Christian Church, namely, "the Lord's brother," the author of the Epistle, and the Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). James the son of Zebedee had by this time been martyred, and James the son of Alphaeus was never much more than a name to the Church in general. There is no mention of this appearance in the Gospel; but in the Gospel of the Hebrews was a curious legend (preserved in St. Jerome, 'De Virr. Illust.,' 2.) that James had made a vow that he would neither eat nor drink till he had seen Jesus risen from the dead, and that Jesus, appearing to him, said, "My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from the dead." The truth of the appearance is strongly supported by the fact that James, like the rest of the Lord's "brothers," "did not believe" in Christ before the Crucifixion, whereas <span class="accented">after the Resurrection</span> we find him and the rest of "the Lord's brothers" ardently convinced (<a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>, etc.). Of all the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>). James the Lord's brother was only an apostle in the wider sense of the word.

The Greek <span class="accented">ektroma</span> is represented by the Latin <span class="accented">abortivus.</span> St. Paul, when he remembered the lateness of his conversion, and his past persecution of the saints, regards himself as standing in this relation to the twelve.

This and the next verse are an explanation of the strong and strange term which he had applied to himself. <span class="cmt_word">The least of the apostles.</span> In St. Paul there was a true and most deep humility, but no mock modesty. He knew the special gifts which he had received from God. He was well aware that to him had been entrusted the ten talents rather than the one talent. He could appeal to far vaster results than had been achieved by the work of any other apostle. He knew his own importance as "a chosen vessel," a special instrument in God's hands to work out exceptional results. But <span class="accented">in himself</span> he always felt, and did not shrink from confessing, that he was "nothing" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>). The notion that he here alludes to the meaning of his own name (<span class="accented">Paulus</span>, connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "little") is very unlikely. In <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a> he goes further, and calls himself "less than the least of all saints," though even there he claims to have been the special apostle of the Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">Because I persecuted the Church of God.</span> This was the one sin for which, though he knew that God had forgiven him (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), yet he could never quite forgive himself (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>). In my 'Life of St. Paul' I have shown from the language used, that this persecution was probably more deadly than has been usually supposed, involving not only torture, but actual bloodshed (<a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a>), besides the martyrdom of St. Stephen. We can imagine how such deeds and such scenes would, even after forgiveness, lie like sparks of fire in a sensitive conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Saints, did I say? with your remembered faces;<br />Dear men and women whom I sought and slew?<br />Oh, when I meet you in the heavenly places,<br />How will I weep to Stephen and to you!"</span>

I laboured more abundantly than they all. Because God wrought effectually in him (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>). The word used for "labour" implies the extreme of toil (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28</a>: <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>), etc. But the grace of God.

In accordance with the testimony just given (vers. 4-8). <span class="cmt_word">We preach.</span> There are in the New Testament two words for "preaching." One is often rendered "prophesy," and refers to spiritual instruction and exhortation. The other, which is used here, is "we proclaim," or "herald" (<span class="accented">kerusso</span>), and refers to the statement of the facts of the gospel - Christ crucified and risen (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The resurrection of Christ is the basis of our faith in the general resurrection.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead.</span> St. Paul sees that if <span class="accented">One</span> has risen from the dead, the fact of that miracle, taken in connection with the rest of the gospel, furnishes Christians with a sufficient proof that they shall rise. "For," he had already said to the Thessalonians, "if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (see the same argument in <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is no resurrection of the dead.</span> These deniers of the resurrection are usually called "the Corinthian Sadducees." After the state of social and moral laxity of which we have been reading, we can scarcely be surprised at the existence of <span class="accented">any</span> disorder or anomaly in the Church of Corinth. Yet it comes with something of a shock on our paralyzed sense of astonishment to read that some of these Christians actually denied a resurrection! The fact at once proves two remarkable truths, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the early Christian Church had none of the ideal purity of doctrine which is sometimes ecclesiastically attributed to it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there was in the bosom of that Church a wide and most forbearing tolerance. We have no data to enable us to determine what were the influences which led to the denial of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> They can hardly have been Jewish. The mass of Jews at this time shared the views of the Pharisees, who strongly maintained the resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>). If they were Jews at all, they could only have been Sadducees or Essenes. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Sadducees</span> were a small, wealthy, and mainly political sect, who had no religious influence, and can certainly have had no representatives at Corinth; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Essenes</span>, though they had considerable influence in Asia, do not seem to have established themselves in Greece, nor are we aware that they were hostile to the doctrine of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Probably, then, they were Gentiles. If so, they may have been <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either <span class="accented">Epicureans</span>, who disbelieved in a future life altogether; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Stoics</span>, who held that the future life was only an impersonal absorption into the Divine. Both these schools of philosophers "jeered" at the very notion of a bodily resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-18.htm">2 Timothy 2:18</a> we read of some, like Hymenaeus and Philetus, who erred, saying "that the resurrection was past already." These teachers were incipient Gnostics, who <span class="accented">spiritualized</span> the resurrection, or rather said that the term was <span class="accented">only</span> applicable to the rising from the death of sin to the life of righteousness. The Corinthian doubters seem from the arguments which St. Paul addresses to them, to have been rather troubled with <span class="accented">material</span> doubts which they may have inherited from their Gentile training.

The attempts to explain them have usually been nothing but ingenious methods of explaining them away. Of these the one usually adopted by the Fathers is the limitation of the statement to Christ's human nature (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26, 27, 30</a>) and mediatorial kingdom, just as we find in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>. The head of Christ is God." We can easily "darken counsel by words without knowledge" in dealing with this subject, and hide an absolute ignorance under a semblance of knowledge; but anything and everything which we can say in "explanation" of this self subjection of the Son to the Father is simply involved in the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">That God may be all in all.</span> "All things in all things" or "all things in all men." The words involve a complete and absolute supremacy. It is quite an easy matter for commentators to say that the scope of the words "must be confined to believers," if they chose to make "all" mean "some." Such methods often lead to an irreligious religionism and a heterodox orthodoxy. The reader will find the same phrase in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>. I confine myself to the comment of the profound and saintly Bengel: "There is implied something new, but also supreme and eternal. All things, and therefore all men, without any interruption, no created thing claiming a place, no enemy creating opposition, shall be subordinated to the Son, the Son to the Father. All things shall say, 'God is all things to me.' This is the consummation; this the end and summit. Further than this not even an apostle can go." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a></div><div class="verse">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-34.</span> - <span class="accented">Arguments from the practices and lives of Christians.</span> The three arguments used in these verses are: If there be no resurrection: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Why do some of you get yourselves baptized on behalf of your dead friends? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Why do we face lives of daily peril? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> How would it be otherwise possible to resist Epicurean views of life? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,</span> etc.? This clause can have but one meaning, and that its obvious one, namely, that, among the many strange opinions and practices which then prevailed, was one which was entirely un-warranted-but which St. Paul does not here stop to examine - of persons getting themselves baptized as it were by <span class="accented">proxy</span> for others who had died. Doubtless some of the deaths alluded to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> had happened to persons who had been cut off before they were actually baptized; and their friends had as it were gone through the rite <span class="accented">in their stead</span>, in the hope of extending to them some of its benefits. It is argued that St. Paul could not possibly mention such a practice without reprobation; but that is an <span class="accented">a priori</span> assumption not warranted by St. Paul's methods (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-6.htm">1 Corinthians 11:6</a>). He always confines his attention to the question immediately before him, and his present object is merely to urge a passing <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem.</span> There is nothing at all surprising in the existence of such an abuse in the medley of wild opinions and wild practices observable in this disorganized Church. It accords with the known tendency of later times to postpone baptism, as a rite which was supposed to work as a charm. We also find that the actual practice of baptism on behalf of the dead lingered on among Corinthians (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 28:7) and Marcionites (Tertullian, 'De Resurrect.,' 48; 'Adv. Marc.,' 5:10). Tertullian accepts the words in their obvious sense in his 'De Praeser. Haer.,' 48, but accepts the absurdity of "the dead" meaning "the body" ("pro mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui") in his book against Marcion (5:10). St. Chrysostom tells us further that the proxy who was to be baptized used to be concealed under the bier of the dead man, who was supposed to answer in his name that he desired to be baptized. How perfectly natural the custom was may be seen from the fact that among the Jews also a man dying under ceremonial pollution was cleansed by proxy. The "interpretations" of this verse are so numerous that it is not even possible to give a catalogue of them. Many of them are not worth recording, and are only worth alluding to at all as specimens of the wilful bias which goes to Scripture, not to seek truth, but to support tradition. They are mostly futile and fantastic, because they pervert the plain meaning of the plain words. It is a waste of time and space to give perpetuity to baseless fancies. Such are the notions that "for the dead" can mean "for our mortal bodies" (Chrysostom); or "for those about to die" (Estius, Calvin, etc.); or "over (the sepulchres of) the dead" (Luther); or "to supply the vacancies left by the dead" (Le Clerc, etc.). Equally unwarrantable are the "explanations" (?) which make those who are being "baptized" mean those who are "passing through a baptism of suffering" (!). Not a single argument which is worth a moment's consideration can be urged in favour of any one of these, or scores of similar views. If we are to get rid of everything that is surprising on the ground that it is "immensely improbable," we may as well discard Scripture at once, and reconstruct early Christian history out of our own consciousness. It has been very usual to represent it as we think that it ought to have been, and not as it was. The disuse of this vicarious baptism among orthodox Christians may have been due to the discouragement of it by St. Paul when he went to Corinth, and "set in order" various erroneous customs (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-34.htm">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>).

It is the most reasonable, and accords with the use of the phrase in <a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>.

A Roman citizen was legally exempt from this mode of punishment. The word points to some special peril incurred in resisting the hostility of the worshippers of Artemis (<a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>), but not to the tumult in the theatre, which did not happen till after this letter was despatched (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 9</a>). The metaphor is not uncommon. Thus in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a> St. Paul alludes to Nero (probably) as "the lion." David often compares his enemies to wild beasts (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, etc.). When his jailor informed Agrippa of the death of Tiberius, he did so in the words, "The lion is dead." St. Ignatius writes of the ten soldiers who were conducting him to Rome as "ten leopards." Epimenides, in the line quoted by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>, spoke of the Cretans as "evil wild beasts," and the pseudo-Heraclitus gives this same uncomplimentary title to these very Ephesians. <span class="cmt_word">Let as eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> Perhaps the "if the dead are not raised" belongs to this clause. He means that such an Epicurean maxim, if never <span class="accented">excusable</span>, would at least be <span class="accented">natural</span>, if men could only look to life in the present. The sentiment is found on the lips of the despairing and the sensual alike in <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, and in the writings of the heathen (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:4, 13-17, etc.). St. Paul would be all the more familiar with it because it formed the infamous epitaph of a statue of Sardauapalus, which he must have often seen in his boyhood at Anchiale, near Tarsus. It represented the debased king as snapping his fingers, and using almost these very words. It is strange that similar passages should be found even in the Talmud.

It is just such a line as he might have seen carved on the Hermae of any Greek town, or preserved in any chrestomathy or gnomology which may have chanced to pass through his hands.

The words "into victory" are the LXX. rendering in other passages (<a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-8.htm">Amos 8:8</a>) for the Hebrew <span class="accented">lanetsach</span>, forever. The metaphor, "is swallowed up," implying "the swallowing of the all swallower," is found in the rabbis (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a></div><div class="verse">O death, where <i>is</i> thy sting? O grave, where <i>is</i> thy victory?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O death, where is thy sting?</span> A triumphantly fervid exclamation of the apostle, loosely cited from <a href="../../par/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>. The apostles and evangelists, not holding the slavish and superstitious fetish worship of the dead letter, often regard it as sufficient to give the general sense of the passages to which they refer. <span class="cmt_word">O grave, where is thy victory?</span> In the best attested reading (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), "death" is repeated, and in the best manuscripts this clause precedes the last. But if the reading, "O Hades," were correct, our translators, since they held it here impossible in accordance with their views to render it by "hell," ought to have taken warning, and seen the pernicious inapplicability of that rendering in other places where they have used it to express this same Greek word. Here "Hades" has probably been introduced into the Greek text from the LXX., which uses it for the <span class="accented">Sheol</span> of the original. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a></div><div class="verse">The sting of death <i>is</i> sin; and the strength of sin <i>is</i> the law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sting of death is sin.</span> Because death is the wages of sin (<a href="../../par/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Death is represented as a venomous serpent. <span class="cmt_word">The strength of sin is the Law.</span> The best comment on this expression is to be found in the Epistle to the Romans; see especially <a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10-12</a>. It must be admitted that this passing allusion to a distinct doctrine does not seem, at first sight, to harmonize with the glorious unity of the subject. No one can read it without a slight sense of <span class="accented">jar</span>, because it seems to introduce the element of dogmatic controversy. But this sense of incongruity is removed when we remember how intensely St. Paul felt that man is confronted with the horror of a broken Law, which at once reminds him of a Being infinitely holy, and of his own self condemnation (<a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.). It is the sense that the Law in its deathful aspect is annulled, and the sinful soul delivered, which prompts the outburst of the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a></div><div class="verse">But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory.</span> The victory consists in the defeat of death by the Resurrection, and the forgiveness of sin through Christ's atone-merit, and the nailing to his cross of the torn and abrogated Law which made us slaves to sin and death (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore.</span> Seeing that you ought not to despair, but to share in this confidence of triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Steadfast</span>.

That your labour is not in vain. The thought of the verse is the same as that of <a href="../../par/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, "And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." Some general facts are very observable in this glorious chapter. 1. One is that St. Paul does not meet doubt by angry denunciation, or by crushing it with the iron mace of impatient authority. What would now be thought of Christians who denied the resurrection? Doubtless they were net mere speculative deniers of the resurrection, like Hymenaeus and Philetus (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>), but recent Gentile converts, who could not get over their pagan difficulties. Yet St. Paul meets them by personal appeals, by helpful analogies, by lofty reasoning, by the glowing force of inspiring convictions. Instead of taking refuge - <span class="accented">more</span> <span class="accented">ecclesiastico</span> - in anathema and excommunication, he meets error by the counter presentation of ennobling truth. 2. Another noteworthy fact is that St. Paul's hope of the resurrection rests, like all his theology, on the thought that the life of the Christian is a life "in Christ." 3. A third is his superiority to false analogies - like those of the butterfly and the phoenix - which sufficed many ancient reasoners. Even Christian writers like St. Clement of Rome continued to appeal to the phoenix as a proof of the resurrection. The greatest ancient thinkers - like Tacitus - believed in the existence of that fabulous bird, and even in the genuineness of a specimen of it which had been exhibited at Rome. Was there no "grace of superintendency" at work which prevented the sacred writers from adopting the universal error of their day? Had St. Paul appealed to the phoenix, centuries of Christian writers would have continued to maintain the existence of that creature; and science, laughing the belief to scorn, would (most unjustly) have made any allusion to it a proof of mental weakness, and of the falsity of the doctrine which it was supposed to prove. 4. A fourth point to be observed is the wisdom with which St. Paul holds himself aloof from speculative fancies, he does not, like Plato, appeal to the doctrine of "reminiscence" (<span class="accented">anamnesis</span>), or of unfulfilled ideas. He does not, like Kant, build any argument on man's failure to obey "the categorical imperative" of duty. He points to the sinless Man - to the fulfilled idea of Christ. His argument, which all could understand, is summed up in the words, "Ye are Christ's, and Christ is risen." Your resurrection from the death of sin to the life of righteousness is a pledge of your participation in Christ's resurrection from the grave. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
