Would that it had received in all ages the loftier and more valuable admiration which would have been expressed by an acceptance of its lessons! Tertullian says that it is uttered "with all the force of the Spirit" (<span class="accented">totis Spiritus viribus</span>). It is a glorious hymn or paean in honour of Christian love, in which St. Paul rises on the wings of inspiration to the most sunlit heights of Christian eloquence. Like the forty-fifth psalm, it may be entitled "A Psalm of Love." Valcknaer says that the "oratorical figures which illuminate the chapter have been born spontaneously in an heroic soul, burning with the love of Christ, and placing all things lower than this Divine love." In vers. 1-3 he shows the absolute <span class="accented">necessity</span> for love; in vers. 4-7 its characteristics; in vers. 8-12 its eternal permanence; in ver. 13 its absolute supremacy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels</span>. The case is merely <span class="accented">supposed.</span> The tongues of men are human languages, including, perhaps, the peculiar utterance of ecstatic inspiration with which he is now dealing. It is, perhaps, with reference to this latter result of spiritual exultation, at any rate in its purest and loftiest developments, that he adds the words, "and of angels." It is unlikely that he is referring to the rabbinic notion that the angels only understood Hebrew, and not Aramaic or other languages. The words are meant to express the greatest possible climax. The most supreme powers of utterance, even of angelic utterance - if any of the Corinthians had or imagined that they had attained to such utterance - are nothing in comparison with the universally possible attainment of Christian love. It is remarkable that here again he places "tongues," even in their grandest conceivable development, on the <span class="accented">lowest</span> step in his climax. <span class="cmt_word">And have not charity.</span> It is deeply to be regretted that the translators of the Authorized Version here introduced from the Vulgate a new translation for the sacred word "love," which dominates the whole New Testament as its Divine keynote. Greek possesses two words for "love." One of these, <span class="accented">eros</span>, implying as it did the love which springs from sensual passion, was dyed too deeply in pagan associations to be capable of redemption into holier usage. It is characteristic of the difference between paganism and Christianity, that Plato's eulogy in the 'Symposium' is in honour of <span class="accented">eros</span>, not of anything resembling <span class="accented">agape.</span> The apostles, therefore, were compelled to describe the ideal of the gospel life by another word, which expressed the love of esteem and reverence and sacred tenderness - the word <span class="accented">agape.</span> This word was not indeed classical. No heathen writer had used it. But the verb <span class="accented">agapao</span>, corresponding to the Latin <span class="accented">diligo</span>, and bring reserved for this loftier kind of love, suggested at once the substantive <span class="accented">agape</span>, which, together with the similar substantive <span class="accented">agapesis</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, etc.), had already been adopted by the LXX. and by Philo and in Wisd. 3:9. The word is thus, as Archbishop Trench says, "born in the bosom of revealed religion" ('New Testament Synonyms,' p. 41). The Vulgate chose <span class="accented">caritas</span> (whence our "charity") to express this love of reason and affection, the dearness which reigns between human beings, and between man and God. This word, like <span class="accented">agape</span>, is absolutely unstained with any evil association. If "charity" had been <span class="accented">exclusively</span> used for <span class="accented">agape</span>, no objection need have arisen, although "love" is English while "charity" is Latin. But it was an Unmixed evil that, by the use of two different words for the same Greek word, English readers should have been prevented from recognizing the unity of thought on this subject which prevails among all the books of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7, 8</a>, etc.). To argue that the word "love" in English is not unmingled with unhallowed uses is absurd, because those uses of the word have never been supposed for a single moment to intrude into multitudes of other passages where love is used to render <span class="accented">agape.</span> Who has ever dreamed of objecting on such grounds to the favourite hymn? - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Faith and Hope and Love we see<br />Joining hand in hand agree;<br />But the greatest of the three<br />And the best is Love."</span> It is true that Lord Bacon admired "the discretion and tenderness of the Rhenish Version" in using the word "charitie," "because of the indifferencies and equivocation of the word [love] with impure love." But that objection, if it ever existed, has now been done away with by the use of "love" in such a multitude of other pure and lofty passages of Holy Writ. It is, therefore, a great gain that the Revised Version restored to this passage the word "love," which had been used by Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva Bible. For in modern English usage the word "charity" is almost confined to "almsgiving," and that of a kind which is often made an excuse for shirking all real self denial, and for <span class="accented">not</span> acting up to the true spirit of love. Christian love is always and infinitely blessed, but the almsgiving which has usurped the name of "charity" often does more harm than good. <span class="cmt_word">I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">I have become booming brass, or clanging cymbal.</span> My "tongues" without "love" become a mere discordant, obtrusive, unintelligible dissonance. The Greek word for "clanging" (<span class="accented">alalazon</span>) is an onomatopoeia, like the Hebrew name for cymbals, <span class="accented">tseltselim</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>).

The power of lofty utterance belonged to Balaam and Caiaphas; yet it availed them nothing without love.

Yet he answers them," I never knew you." <span class="cmt_word">All mysteries.</span> Though I can speak of the secrets of God once hidden but now revealed (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And all knowledge.</span> Insight into the deeper meanings of Scripture, etc. <span class="cmt_word">All faith.</span> Not here meaning "justifying faith," or "saving faith," which can no more exist without showing itself in works than light can exist without heat; but <span class="accented">fides miraculosa</span>, reliance on the power to work wonders. Judas, for instance, must have possessed this kind of faith, and it was exercised by "many" who will yet be rejected because they also work iniquity (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that I could remove mountains.</span> It has been supposed that this must be a reference to <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>. It is, however, much more probable that, if St. Paul derived the words from our Lord, they came to him by oral tradition. And the inference must in any case be precarious, for the phrase was so common among the rabbis that "remover of mountains" was one of their admiring titles for a great teacher<span class="cmt_word">. I am nothing.</span> No expression could 'involve a more forcible rebuke to intellectual and spiritual pride. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor</i>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor.</span> The five words, "bestow to feed the poor," represent the one Greek word <span class="accented">psomiso</span>, and after all do not give its force. It is derived from <span class="accented">psomion</span>, a mouthful, and so means "give away by mouthfuls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">dole</span> away." It occurs in <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> for "feed." Attention to this verse might have served as a warning against the often useless and sometimes even pernicious doles of mediaeval monasteries. Much of the "charity" of these days is even more uncharitable than this, and shows the most complete absence of true charity; as for instance the dropping of pennies to professional beggars, and so putting a premium on vice and imposture. <span class="cmt_word">To be burned</span>. The reading is extremely uncertain. The change of a letter gives the reading, <span class="accented">that I may glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Perhaps the scribes thought that "death by burning" was as yet (A.D. 57) an unheard of form of martyrdom, though it became but too familiar ten or twelve years later in the Neronian persecution. St. Paul was, however, probably referring, not, as some have supposed, to <span class="accented">branding</span>, which would bare been expressed differently, but to the case of the "three children," in <a href="../../par/daniel/3-23.htm">Daniel 3:23</a>, where the LXX. has, "They gave their bodies <span class="accented">into the fire</span>;" or to the various tortures and deaths by fire in 2 Macc. 7. At the burning of Ridley and Latimer, Dr. Smith chose this verse for his text. Its applicability is on a par with millions of other instances in which Scripture has been grossly abused by employing its letter to murder its spirit, and by taking it from the God of love to give it to the devil of religious hatred. The burning of a saint was a singular specimen of the Church's "love." <span class="cmt_word">It profiteth me nothing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I am nothing benefited.</span> A consideration of this verse might have shown the Christians of the early centuries that there was nothing <span class="accented">intrinsically</span> redemptive in the martyrdom into which they often thrust themselves.

Vulgar indecorum is alien from love, as having its root in selfishness and want of sympathy. "Noble manners" are ever the fruit of "noble minds."

The corresponding substantive (<span class="accented">paroxusmos</span>, whence our "paroxysm") is used of the sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas (<a href="../../par/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>). Love, when it is perfected, rises superior to all temptations to growing <span class="accented">exasperated</span>, although it may often be justly indignant. But, as St. Chrysostom says, "As a spark which falls into the sea hurts not the sea, but is itself extinguished, so an evil thing befalling a loving soul will be extinguished without disquietude." Thinketh no evil; literally, <span class="accented">doth not reckon</span> (or, <span class="accented">impute</span>) <span class="accented">the evil.</span> The phrase seems to be a very comprehensive one, implying that love is neither suspicious, nor implacable, nor retentive in her memory of evil done. Love writes our personal wrongs in ashes or in water.

St. Paul says that no human eye can see God at all except as an image seen as it were behind the mirror. <span class="cmt_word">Darkly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in a riddle.</span> God is said to have spoken to Moses "by means of riddles" (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; Authorized Version, "in dark speeches"), Human language, dealing with Divine facts, can only represent them indirectly, metaphorically, enigmatically, under human images, and as illustrated by visible phenomena. God can only be represented under the phrases of anthropomorphism and anthropopathy; and such phrases can only have <span class="accented">a relative</span>, not an absolute, truth. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "when the perfect is come." <span class="cmt_word">Face to face.</span> Like the "mouth to mouth" of the Hebrew and the LXX. in <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>. This is the beatific vision. "We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). "Now we walk by faith, <span class="accented">not by sight"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Then shall I know even as also I am known; rather, <span class="accented">then shall I fully know even as also I was fully known</span>, viz. when Christ took knowledge of me at my conversion. Now, we do not so much "know" God, but "rather <span class="accented">are known of God"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a></div><div class="verse">And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> charity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now.</span> The "now" is not temporal (as opposed to the "then" of the previous verse), but logical. It sums up the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">Abideth</span>. These three graces are fundamental and permanent; not transient, like the <span class="accented">charisms</span>, on which the Corinthians were priding themselves, but which should all be "annulled." <span class="cmt_word">Faith, hope, charity.</span> It might be difficult to see how "hope" should be permanent. But if the future state be progressive throughout eternity and infinitude, hope will never quite be lost in fruition. Even "within the veil," it will still remain as "an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The greatest of these is charity;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">greater than these is love.</span> St. Paul does not explain <span class="accented">why</span> love is the greatest and best of the three. Various reasons may be given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Love is the greatest, because it is the root of the other two; "we <span class="accented">believe</span> only in that which we love; we <span class="accented">hope</span> only for that which we love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> And love is the greatest because love is for our neighbours; faith and hope mainly for ourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> And love is the greatest because faith and hope are human, but God is love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> And love is the greatest because faith and hope can only work by love, and only show themselves by love. Thus love is as the undivided perfection of sevenfold light. Faith and hope are precious stones of one colour, as a ruby and a sapphire; but love, as he has been showing us throughout the chapter, is a diamond of many facets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
