The ancients were much less particular about these small matters of precision and symmetry than the moderns; and writers who are deeply moved by their subject, and hurried along by the strength of their feelings, often fall into these unfinished constructions (see <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, etc., in the Greek). <span class="cmt_word">Dumb idols.</span> This characteristic of idols (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-16.htm">Psalm 135:16</a>) is fixed upon to show that their "oracles" were mere falsity and pretence. We find an illustration of the epithet in the statue of Isis at Pompeii, where the ruined temple shows the secret stair by which the priest mounted to the back of the statue; and the <span class="accented">head</span> of the statue (preserved in the Museo Borbonico) shows the tube which went from the back of the head to the parted lips. Through this tube the priest concealed behind the statue spoke the answers of Isis. <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye were led;</span> rather, <span class="accented">howsoever ye might be led</span>, as in the Revised Version.

The phrase is a Hebrew one to describe inspiration. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus accursed.</span> It may well seem amazing that the Corinthians should need instructing that such awful language could not be uttered by any one speaking "in the Spirit of God." It is evident, however, that such expressions <span class="accented">had</span> been uttered by persons who were, or seemed to be, carried away by the impassioned impulse which led to "glossolaly." (It is better to use this technical word in order to dissipate the cloud of strange misconceptions as to the true nature of this <span class="accented">charism.</span>) So terrible an outrage on the conscience of Christians could never have passed unchecked and unpunished, except from the obvious inability of the young community to grapple with the new and perplexing phenomena of an "inspiration" which appeared to destroy the personal control of those possessed by it. Among Jewish converts glossolaly was regarded as a form of that wild mantle "inspiration" of which we find some traces in Jewish history (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>, etc.), and which was alluded to in the very name <span class="accented">Nabo</span>, which implied a boiling energy. Among Gentile converts the glossolaly would be classed with the overmastering influences of which they read, or which they witnessed, in the Sibyls, the Pythian priestesses, and the wild orgiastic devotees of Eastern cults. They would not like to call any one to task for things spoken in a condition which they regarded as wholly supernatural. As to the speakers, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> some of them, not being sincere, might have really fallen under the influence of impulses which were earthly and demonish, not Divine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> others, not duly controlling their own genuine impulse, may have been liable to the uncontrolled sway of utterances for which they were at the moment irresponsible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> or again, being incapable of reasoned expression, they may have audibly expressed vague Gnostic doubts as to the identity of the "Jesus" who was crucified and the Divine Word; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> they may have been entangled in Jewish perplexities rising from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, "He that is hanged" (which was also the expression applied by Jews to the crucified) "is accursed of God;" or finally, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> by some strange abuse of the true principle expressed by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>, they may have asserted in this fearful form their emancipation from the acknowledgment of Jesus "after the flesh." Similar phenomena - the same intrusions into worship of downright blasphemy or of blasphemous familiarity - have constantly recurred at times of overwhelming spiritual excitement, as for instance m the adherents of the "everlasting gospel" in the thirteenth century, and in various movements of our own day. <span class="accented">Is accursed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is anathema.</span> The word corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, which means "a ban," and "what is devoted or set apart by a ban;" and to the Latin <span class="accented">sacer</span>, which means not only "sacred," set apart by holy consecration, but also "devoted to destruction." <span class="cmt_word">No man can say that Jesus is [the] Lord, but by [in] the Holy Ghost.</span> It involved a strong rebuke to the <span class="accented">illuminati</span>, who professed a profound spiritual insight, to tell them that no man could make the simple, humble confession of the divinity of Jesus (for "Lord" is here an equivalent of the Hebrew "Jehovah") except by the same inspiration as that which they so terribly abused. There is a very similar passage in <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; but there the "test" of the inspiration is a confession of the humanity of Jesus as against Gnostics, who treated his human life as purely phantasmal. Here the test is the confession of his divinity as against Jews and Gentiles. (For a parallel passage, see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.")

There were such things as "deceitful spirits" which spoke "doctrines of devils" (l Timothy 4:1; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 2</a>; see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>). Divers kinds of tongues. There is no need for the word "divers." The particular variety of the ecstatic, and often entirely unintelligible, utterance known as "the tongue" differed with the individuality or temperament of the speaker. Recent lines of research, by that historical method which can alone furnish correct results, have led to the conclusion that, whatever may be thought of the "tongues" on the day of Pentecost (which is a separate question), the "tongue" spoken of (for the most part with <span class="accented">relative</span> disparagement) by St. Paul as a <span class="accented">charism</span> of the Spirit was closely analogous to that wild, rapt, unconscious, uncontrollable utterance which, with varying details, has always occurred in the religious movements which stir the human soul to its utmost depths. The attempts to explain the word "tongues" as meaning "foreign languages," or "the primeval language," or "poetic and unusual phraseology," etc., are baseless and exploded. The notion that by this gift the early Christians knew languages which they had never acquired, is not only opposed to the entire analogy of God's dealings, but to every allusion in the New Testament (except a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> but untenable view of the meaning of <a href="../../par/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>) and to every tradition and statement of early Christian history. The apostles (so far as we have any record of their missionary work in the New Testament) had not the slightest need to acquire foreign languages. Since Palestine was at this epoch bilingual, they could all speak Aramaic and Greek, and therefore could address Jews and Gentiles throughout the civilized world. Every single allusion which St. Paul makes to this subject excludes the possibility of the supposition of a miracle so utterly useless and meaningless, so subversive of every psychological consideration, and so alien from the analogy of all God's methods, as the talking in unacquired foreign languages by persons who did not understand them. <span class="cmt_word">The interpretation of tongues.</span> Sometimes, but not always (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-13.htm">1 Corinthians 14:13</a>), the speaker, on relapsing from his ecstasy, was able to express his outburst of unintelligible soliloquy in the form of reasoned thought When he was unable to do so, St. Paul ordains that another should convey in ordinary language the impressions left by the inspired rhapsody (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-27.htm">1 Corinthians 14:27-29</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-21.htm">1 Corinthians 12:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have no need of thee.</span> A rebuke to the pride of those who thought their own gifts to be exclusively valuable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22</a></div><div class="verse">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are necessary.</span> This is the point of the fable of the belly and the members. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-23.htm">1 Corinthians 12:23</a></div><div class="verse">And those <i>members</i> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which we think to be less honourable</span>. The shelter and ornament of clothing are used to cover those parts of the body which are conventionally regarded as the least seemly. The whole of this illustration is meant to show that rich and poor, great and small, high and low, gifted and ungifted, have all their own separate and indispensable functions, and no class of Christians can wisely disparage or forego the aid derived from other and different classes. The unity of the members in one body corresponds to "the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" which should prevail in the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-24.htm">1 Corinthians 12:24</a></div><div class="verse">For our comely <i>parts</i> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <i>part</i> which lacked:</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-25.htm">1 Corinthians 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">That there should be no schism in the body; but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care one for another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No schism in the Body.</span> What is exclusively called "schism" is not necessarily such. There may be difference of fold in the one flock. There may be no real discord or dissension, though there may be varieties of ecclesiastical government. Unity, as the whole argument shows, does not demand the existence of uniformity. <span class="cmt_word">That the members should have the same care one for another.</span> Thus the early believers "were of one heart and of one soul;" and the moment that a complaint arose that one of the weakest and smallest interests was neglected, the supposed neglect was amply remedied (<a href="../../par/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a></div><div class="verse">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it,</span> etc. St. Chrysostom illustrates this verse by saying that if a thorn runs into the heel, the whole body feels it and is troubled; and that, on the ether hand, if the head is garlanded, the whole man is glorified. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a></div><div class="verse">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular</span>. Each Church is a sort of microcosm of the whole Church. St. Paul does not mean that the Corinthian Church is a member in the body of all the Churches, but that each Corinthian Christian is a member of the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a></div><div class="verse">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath set;</span> rather, <span class="accented">appointed. <span class="cmt_word"></span>First apostles.</span> Apart from the twelve (<a href="../../par/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>) and Paul and Barnabas, the name was in a lower sense extended to leading and eminent Christians, especially to those who had taken part in founding or ruling Churches (<a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>. Wise spiritual preachers. It is instructive to note that St. Paul places the gifts of wisdom and knowledge which these preachers require above those which we are apt to regard as exclusively miraculous. The "wonders" stood in a lower, not in a higher, position when compared with the ordinary gifts of grace. <span class="cmt_word">Teachers</span>. Those who have the minor gifts of instruction and exposition (<a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Helps</span>. All the services rendered by the power of active sympathy; by the work of deacons, sisters of mercy, etc. (<a href="../../par/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3, 4</a>). The word occurs in 2 Macc. 8:19; Ecclus. 11:12, and the corresponding verb in <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>; see <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Governments.</span> Powers of leading and organization. <span class="cmt_word">Diversities [kinds] of tongues.</span> Ranked as <span class="accented">last</span> in value. They are emotional gifts, which had only a very subordinate part in the work of edification, and are, therefore, placed below the gifts of knowledge, of power, and of practical life, which sum up the previous enumeration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-29.htm">1 Corinthians 12:29</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>are</i> all prophets? <i>are</i> all teachers? <i>are</i> all workers of miracles?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are all apostles?</span> etc. It is God's providence which "has appointed divers orders in his Church," and has "ordained and constituted the services of angels and of men in a wonderful order."

The verse means either, "And further" (besides bidding you aim at the better gifts), "I show you <span class="accented">one supreme way of attaining them</span>;" or, "And I show you a still more eminent way." I bid you desire the best gifts, and further show you a truly royal road (<span class="accented">viam maxime vialem</span>), a road <span class="accented">par excellence</span>, which leads to their attainment. The way of love would lead to them, and it was itself the best of them.
