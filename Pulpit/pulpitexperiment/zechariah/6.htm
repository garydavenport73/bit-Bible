The angel explains, in vers. 5, etc., what these chariots mean, how that they represent God's judgments on sinners in all the world. Though evil is removed from the Church, God's vengeance pursues it wherever it is located. If we compare this vision with the first (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>), we shall see that the quiet there spoken of is here broken, and that the shaking of the nations, which is to accompany Messiah's advent (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>), has begun. That the four chariots are to be identified with the four powers of Daniel's visions (2 and 7.) - the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Macedonian, and Roman - is an opinion that does not commend itself. These four kingdoms and their fate have been already symbolized in the horns of the second vision (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19-21</a>), and it is most unlikely that they should be again introduced under a different figure. This would mar the orderly development of the revelation. And how could these kingdoms, such as they were, be said to issue from the seat of the theocracy and to be attentive to God's commands? Further, how could the chariots symbolize the kingdoms which were to be the objects of punishment, when at the same time they are themselves the instruments which inflict the chastisement? Neither does the angel's explanation suit this notion; for kingdoms are nowhere found under the figure of winds, and such a symbol would have been unintelligible to the prophet without further elucidation. <span class="cmt_word">Two mountains.</span> The Hebrew has the article, "the two mountains," two well known mountains. The scene of the vision is Jerusalem or its neighbourhood; hence the two mountains mentioned are thought to he those of Zion or the temple mount, and Olives (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>). It is impossible to identify them; end probably nothing more is meant than that the chariots came forth from a defile between the two mountains which appeared in the vision. <span class="cmt_word">Mountains of brass;</span> or, <span class="accented">copper</span>. These impregnable, undecaying mountains represent the immovable, invincible nature of the theocracy and of God's decrees respecting it. From it the chariots go forth, because for the sake of God's kingdom and to promote its objects the world powers are destroyed (Knabenbauer) (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>). The number "four" represents completeness; the judgment shall leave no quarter unvisited. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">In the first chariot <i>were</i> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Red horses (</span>see note on Zechariah 1:8). The colours of the horses are significant, though the symbols are not undisputed. "Red" symbolizes bloodshed and war (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>); "black," sorrow and mourning (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5</a>); "white," victory and joy (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>). What the colour of the horses in the fourth chariot means is very doubtful (see below on ver. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grisled and bay;</span> rather, <span class="accented">speckled, strong</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, "horses pied and dapple-grey." But <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is explained by the Scholiast in Aristophanes, 'Nub.,' 1225, as "swift;" and possibly the LXX. used it in that sense here. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">fortes</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. One would have expected a colour to be named. but why these are specially mentioned as strong or active is seen in ver. 7. The word <span class="accented">beruddim</span>, "speckled," occurs only in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 12</a>, where it has no symbolical character. As it denotes a combination of colours, probably spots of white on a dark ground, it may signify a quality of a mixed, nature, thus indicating a visitation of war and pestilence, the sword and famine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</div><div class="comm">

It was a familiar symbol to the Jews. The winds are often introduced in executing God's will on sinners (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth from standing before the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>). The winds are supposed to be God's servants, waiting his pleasure to be sent forth on his errands. The Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "which go forth to stand before the Lord." This denotes merely their usual obedience; but the text implies that the prophet sees them moving from their usual expectant attitude, and hastening forth to do God's commands. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">The black horses which <i>are</i> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The angel now (vers. 6, 7) indicates the various destinations of the chariots, except the first with the red horses. Why this is omitted has never been satisfactorily explained. Some regard ver. 7 as giving the destination of this chariot, by making a  slight change in the word rendered "bay" in the Authorized Version, which would cause it to mean "red." The Syriac, indeed, which omits the word in ver. 3, translates it here by "red." If we retain the Masoretic reading, we must let this difficulty remain unsolved, and suppose that the angel explains only part of the vision, leaving the rest for the prophet's meditation. <span class="cmt_word">The black horses which are therein;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that wherein are the black horses, they go forth</span>, etc.; which is equivalent to "the chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth."

One chariot only is seen to go towards it, drawn by the speckled horses that denote a mixed judgment, perhaps of war and pestilence (see on ver. 3). The north and south symbolize the whole earth and the powers hostile to the true Israel.

Others see here an intimation of mercy and grace to the Jews still resident in Babylonia. But it is plain that the vision is one of judgment: and the Spirit of the Lord is a Spirit of judgment and vengeance (<a href="../../par/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>), which destroys evil that good may flourish.

At any rate, at his house the envoys were entertained, and there were stored the contributions which the Jews in exile had sent to their brethren in Jerusalem. Josiah is the same person as Hen, according to the Authorized Version and the Vulgate, in ver. 14 (where see note). He was probably son of the Zephaniah mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a> as in the second rank of priests among those who were deported to Babylon (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>).

It is certain that only one crown was to be made, and that that was to be placed on Joshua's head. There is no mention of Zerubbabel in the passage; so the plural cannot be taken to intimate that there was a crown for the high priest and a crown for the princely ruler, as Ewald and Bunsen assert. These critics, followed by Hitzig and Wellhausen, supply the passage thus: "on the head of Zerubbabel and on the head of Joshua." Zerubbabel had no kingly position. Rather, all mention of Zerubbabel is expressly excluded, in order to denote that in the Person of him whom Joshua symbolized, the offices of priest and king were united (<a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>). We may note that in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> Christ is said to have on his head many crowns, by which is meant a diadem composed of many circlets. The high priest's mitre is never called a crown. That which was placed on Joshua's head was a royal crown, a token of royal dignity, not his own, but his whom he represented - Christ the eternal Priest, the universal King.

The clause is omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bear the glory.</span> The word rendered "glory" is used to denote royal honours here, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>. Messiah shall have regal majesty. Compare the many passages where the glory of Christ is spoken of; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit and rule upon his throne</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). Thus Christ says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; see <a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be a Priest upon his throne;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "There shall be a Priest upon his right hand." The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, as the clause is intended to declare that Messiah should, like Melchizedek, combine the offices of Priest and King (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6, 10</a>). The counsel of peace shall be between them both. The two offices or dignities are meant, which are combined in one person. The Messiah, in his two offices of Priest and King, has one common design, to bring peace to his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, where see note). Other interpretations are unsuitable. Thus: There shall be harmony between Joshua and Zerubbabel; but the two are nowhere mentioned together in the paragraph, and, indeed, the statement would be superfluous. There shall be perfect concord between the two offices; but a person is spoken cf. not an abstraction. Others explain the "counsel of peace" to be between Jews and Gentiles, or the returned and the exiled Jews; but neither of these have been named. Pusey takes it to mean, "between the Father and the Son;" but there is nothing in the passage to lead to this. Kuabenhauer expounds it of those who alone are mentioned in the text, Messiah and Joshua, seeing in it an exhortation to the latter to make the type correspond to the Antitype, so that all may see that there is perfect harmony between them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The crowns shall be... for a memorial.</span> The crown was to be taken from  Joshua's head and deposited in the temple as a memorial of this prophecy, and of the zeal of those who had come from far to bring offerings to the Lord, and likewise of the hospitality of Josiah, who had received them into his house. That such "gifts" were dedicated in the temple is well known (see Judith 16:19; 2 Macc. 5:16 2Macc. 9:16; Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 3; 'Ant.,' 17:06. 3; 19:6. 1; Philo, 'Legat. ad Cal.,' &sect; 40, 2 p. 592). <span class="cmt_word">Helem</span> is the same as <span class="accented">Heldai</span> (ver. 10), whether he bore both names, or whether, as is probable, this is a mere mistake of a copyist. <span class="cmt_word">To Hen.</span> The Authorized Version considers this as a proper name. In this case it would be another name for Josiah. But it is really an appellative, and the rendering should be, "for the kindness of the son of Zephaniah." The crown would be also a memorial of his kindness in receiving and entertaining these exiles (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>).
