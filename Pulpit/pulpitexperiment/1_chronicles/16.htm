So ch. 15:1 distinctly states that David had "pitched a tent" for the ark, and evidently to be ready for its arrival. On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-12.htm">1 Chronicles 13:12, 13</a>), for a while, at all events. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (tent) of the original designates, when Intended strictly, a haircloth covering, resting on poles or planks (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14, 19</a>). The first occasion of the use of the word is found in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (booth) was made of leaves and branches interwoven (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 40, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (tabernacle) was the dwelling-place or pavilion, which owned to the ten inner curtains as well as the outer covering and the framework (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 12-15</a>, etc.; Exodus 39:32; 40:2, 29). The first occurrence of this word is in the first of these last-quoted references. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt sacrifices and peace offerings</span>. The identical words of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17, 18</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "burnt offerings and peace offerings." These were the two great sacrifices - the former speaking of atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>, etc.), the latter of <span class="accented">reconciliation effected</span> and the enjoyment of peace (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-5</a>, etc.). Neither here nor in the parallel place is any mention made of the altar upon which these sacrifices were offered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He blessed the people in the name of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reverently in the Name of the Lord, and as vividly conscious of being in his presence, he pronounces blessings upon the people, and by short ejaculatory prayer and holy wish further begs for them those blessings which God only can give. In the time of David and Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>) the king realized far more closely the idea of the paternal relation to the people than had ever been since the time of the patriarchs of the elder days. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Each little clause of this verse is replete with interest. The royal giver, who now <span class="cmt_word">dealt to every one of Israel</span>, was, after all, but a channel; yes, and only one channel, through which the fulness and the bounty of the royal Giver of every good and perfect gift, of all good whatsoever, of all things necessary to life and godliness, are supplied to every one of his creature-subjects. But it is highest honour, as servant and instrument alone, to figure forth him in any way. The second little clause tells us either that <span class="cmt_word">women</span> took a recognized place on occasion of this joyous festival, or that the hospitality of such an occasion did not forget them and their homes. And the following three little clauses require closer examination. The word here translated "loaf" in the expression <span class="cmt_word">loaf of bread</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, for which in this sense we may turn to <a href="../../par/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>. The corresponding word, however, in the parallel place is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (for which see <a href="../../par/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-15.htm">Numbers 6:15, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20</a>). The essential meaning of the former word is a <span class="accented">circle</span>, hence applied to the cake because of its shape, and of the latter word <span class="accented">perforation</span>, hence applied to the cake because it was perforated. <span class="cmt_word">A good piece of flesh</span>. This is the Authorized Version rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, which occurs only in the parallel place and here. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">assatura bubulae carnis</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. The imagined derivation of the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (ox) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (fire), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (to burn), seems to be what has led to these translations, helped, perhaps, by the apparent convenience of adapting <span class="accented">meat</span> from the sacrifice to the <span class="accented">bread.</span> But Gesenius, Rodiger, Keil, and others prefer the derivation <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to measure), and they would render "a measure" of wine. <span class="cmt_word">And a flagon</span>. This is the Authorized Version rendering of the original <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, found in the parallel place as well as here, and also in the only other places (two in number, and in the plural) where it occurs (<a href="../../par/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; Hoses 3:1). But there is no doubt, or but little, that the rendering should rather be "dried, pressed cakes of raisins or grapes." It is then to be derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (to press). The substantive has both masculine and feminine form in plural. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">similam frixam oleo</span>, which means a "baked cake of flour and oil;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the parallel places. But here the Septuagint reads <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> the whole account of the loaf, the good piece of flesh, and the flagon.

The verse seems to describe what should be the essence of that service. It was threefold - <span class="cmt_word">to record, to thank</span>, and to praise the Lord God of Israel. The word here used for "record" is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to remember), and is remarked upon by Gesenius as a title strictly appropriate to the character of the two psalms Psalms 38 and Psalms 70, on the head of which it stands, as meaning, "to make others remember" (see also such passages as <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>). The minds of the people were to be refreshed in this service and in their very psalm of praise (so note in this sense vers. 8, 9, 12, 21, etc.), by being reminded or told, so far as the youngest of them might be concerned, of God's marvellous and merciful deeds for their forefathers of many, many a generation. Then they were to give intelligent and hearty thanks. And, lastly, they were to offer to approach that purest form of worship which consists in adoring praise. One might imagine with what zest they would have accepted, with what fervour they would have added lip and instrument of music to it - that one verse which needed the revolution yet of nearly another three thousand years, that it might flow from the devotion or' Addison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When all thy mercies, O my God,<br />My rising soul surveys,<br />Transported with the view I'm lost<br />In wonder, love, and praise."</span>

The contents of this verse put us, then, into possession of this much, that Asaph presided (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a>) at this musical service, and that his instrument was the cymbals (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>), with which time was kept; that Zechariah was next to him, and, with eight others formed a band, who played on <span class="cmt_word">psalteries</span> (or lutes) and <span class="cmt_word">harps</span>. If we may guide ourselves by vers. 20, 21 of the preceding chapter, three of these - viz. Mattithia, Jeiel, Obed-edom  - performed on the harp, the other six on the psaltery, or lute.

David makes selections from four psalms already known; for it cannot be supposed that the verses we have here were the original, and that they were afterwards supplemented. The first fifteen verses (viz. 8-22) are from <a href="../../par/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1-15</a>. The next eleven verses (23-33) are from <a href="../../par/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a>; but a small portion of the first and last of these verses is omitted. Our thirty-fourth verse is identical with <a href="../../par/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-1.htm">Psalm 118:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>; and forms the larger part of <a href="../../par/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. It is, in fact, a doxology. And our thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses consist of a short responsive ("and say ye") invocation, followed by another doxology. These are taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47, 48</a>. Hereupon "all the people" are directed to find the final outburst of praise to Jehovah, and "Amen." In the first of these selections (vers. 8-23) there is no material variation from the language of the psalm itself. Yet the original psalm has <span class="accented">Abraham</span>, where our own thirteenth verse reads <span class="accented">Israel.</span> And the original psalm uses the third person, where our fifteenth and nineteenth verses have the second person. In the second selection it is worthy of note that our ver. 29, "Come before him," probably preserves the ante-temple reading, while <a href="../../par/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a> was afterwards, to fit temple times, altered into, "<span class="accented">Come</span> <span class="accented">into his courts."</span> The arrangement of all the succeeding clauses does not exactly agree with the arrangement of them found in the psalm, as for instance in the latter half of our ver. 30 and in ver. 31, compared with the clauses of vers. 10,11 of the psalm. Again, one clause of the tenth verse of the psalm, "He shall judge the people righteously," is not found in either alternative position open to it through the inversion of clauses, in our vers. 80, 81. The rhythm and metre of the psalm are, however, equally unexceptionable. The whole of the twenty-nine verses of this Psalm of praise (vers. 8-36 inclusive) are divided into portions of three verses each, except the portion vers. 23-27 inclusive which consists of five verses. As regards the matter of it, it may be remarked on as breaking into two parts, in the first of which (vers. 8-22) the people are reminded of their past history and of the marvellous providence which had governed their career from Abraham to the time they were settled in Canaan, but in the second (vers. 23-36) their thought is enlarged, their sympathies immensely widened, so as to include all the world, and their view is borne on to the momentous reality of <span class="accented">judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - These verses are an animated invocation to thanks and praise.

The suggestion in the midst of the unbounded gladness of this day is affecting, and must have been intended for salutary lesson and timely warning. In the midst of the fulness of praise and joy, the people are led to prayer - say ye - and the prayer is an humble petition for salvation, union, and protection from every enemy. God's treatment of his anointed people had been on his part one continued protection and one prolonged salvation. Yet they had often neither prayed for these nor acknowledged them. Now they are led again by the hand, as it were, to the footstool of the throne.

And the first of them may be considered to mark an important step in advance in the crystallizing of the world's ecclesiastical institutions. Asaph and his brethren of song are <span class="cmt_word">left there before the ark of the covenant...  to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required</span>. A permanent local ministry and choir are thus established, with a fixity of place on Zion, and regularity of time that had been hitherto unattainable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a></div><div class="verse">And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Obed-edom with their brethren</span>. Explanation is needed of the <span class="accented">plural</span> pronoun "their." Either another name is wanted with Obed-edom, or tacit reference is made to "Asaph and his brethren," as though the name Asaph had not been followed in its own place by the clause "and his brethren." Keil draws attention to the "three score and two" of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>, in connection with the <span class="cmt_word">three score and eight</span> of this place; and it has been proposed to make up this number by some of the sons of <span class="cmt_word">Hosah</span>, of our following verse and of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">1 Chronicles 26:11</a>. In this case the name Hesah might be the name missing before, "and their brethren." Conjecture, however, has not sufficient clue here to warrant it, and the textual state of this verse must be debited with the obscurity. The ambiguity respecting the name Obed-edom has already (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>) been alluded to. Neglecting this ambiguity, it may be repeated that <span class="cmt_word">Obed-edom,...  son of Jedithun</span> (as the Keri of this passage is) was a Merarite Levite, while Obed-edom son of Jeduthun (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>) was of Gath-rimmon, a Gittite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>), a Kohathite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-66.htm">1 Chronicles 6:66, 69</a>), and a Korhite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-5</a>).

It is now brought into prominence that the ark and the tabernacle are in two separate places. The great ordinary sacrifices and services, "all that is written in the Law of the Lord," are carefully observed on the original altar (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>) in the tabernacle. Other and special sacrifices evidently were offered in the presence of the ark. The tabernacle erected in the wilderness was first stationed at Shiloh (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>). The occasion of its removal to Nob (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>) is not narrated. The present passage first tells us where it had been since the slaughter of the priests at Saul's command by Doeg the Edomite. Some distinct statement, like that of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, might have been expected here<span class="cmt_word">. Zadok the priest</span> is given (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-9</a>) as in the line of Eleazar.

The Septuagint does not show them in the <span class="accented">latter</span> verse. The sons of Jeduthun are found in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>.
