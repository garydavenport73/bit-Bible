The occasion referred to is evidently that recorded in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1, 26</a>; and generally in those and the intermediate chapters. David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-7</a>). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3-6</a>). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, "they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep," is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The <span class="accented">middle voice</span> form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>They were</i> armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in <i>hurling</i> stones and <i>shooting</i> arrows out of a bow, <i>even</i> of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of Saul's brethren of Benjamin</span>. It would be better to read these words as the commencement of the next verse. Prominence is given to the fact that this set of helpers of David, counting in all twenty-three, comprised Benjamites - men of the same tribe with Saul (ver. 29). They had seen and been impressed by the wrongness and cruelty of Saul, and found themselves unable to keep in sympathy with him. Of such were Eleazar, Ilai, and Ithai, mentioned in the preceding chapter (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12, 29, 31</a>, respectively). The Benjamites were noted both for their use of the bow, and of their own left hand (<a href="../../par/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-39.htm">1 Chronicles 8:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>).

This has the effect of making Joash the son of Ahiezer, and it makes Shemaah a third name in the list. This name has in the Hebrew the form for the article before it, and should appear in our version either as "Has-Shemaah," or "the Shemaah." The name, together with that of Azmaveth, is found in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13, 36</a>, as belonging to the Benjamite tribe. The name Jeziel is omitted in the Syriac Version, and the two names <span class="cmt_word">Pelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Berachah</span> appear as sons of Azmaveth (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-33.htm">1 Chronicles 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-31.htm">2 Samuel 23:31</a>, where the Baharmite means the Baharumite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man of <span class="accented">Bahurim</span>, in Benjamin). The Antothite; that is, native of Anathoth. The place is not given in <a href="../../par/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18</a>; but it was a "priests' city" with "suburbs," belonging to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-27.htm">Jeremiah 29:27</a>).

Yet the name of <span class="cmt_word">Ismaiah</span> does not appear in the list of the preceding chapter, nor in its parallel; nor is it possible to identify it with any that does appear there. The suggested explanation is that he was in the <span class="accented">first edition</span> of that list, and died early. The expression, "among the thirty, and over the thirty," may possibly mean that, from distinction as one of them, he was promoted above them to be leader of them. <span class="cmt_word">Josabad the Gederathite</span>. The name should be spelt Jozabad. The Gederah here suggested cannot to all appearance be that of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>, in the Shephelah of Judah, as Jozabad was a Benjamite.

Some authorities are as positive that this name designates Levitic <span class="accented">Korahites</span>, as others are sceptical about it. Bertheau explains the name as meaning descendants of Korah of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>). Others surmise that a Benjamite Korah, otherwise unknown to us, is pointed to. There does not seem any intrinsic difficulty in supposing that these were some of the Levite Korahites, whose proper and allotted abode was in Benjamin, or perhaps in Judah.

If it be the Gedor in Judah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>), it is to be noted still that Jeroham is a name of a Benjamite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>).

There follow (vers. 24-37) the numbers of each tribe (the full <span class="accented">thirteen</span> being enumerated) who "came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel." The large numbers of some of the joyful pilgrims to Hebron, as for instance of the trans-Jordanic tribes, the very small number that came of the tribe of Judah (in fact, lowest but one, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Benjamin, and yet nearest home), and of some others, help to invest with doubt the numerals of this passage, although it is not at all difficult to suggest some very passable explanations of these phenomena. This doubt is not lessened by the total, which, according to this list, must make a figure between three hundred and forty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand men. To the host have to be added, as we are expressly told, the "asses, camels, mules, and oxen," which carried the "bread, meat, meal, cakes of figs and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance," for the consumption of the host during their "three days' "stay "with David," and their journeys to and fro. In the presence of such numbers, and the celebration of such an occasion, Hebron must indeed have beheld the reflection of its own probable meaning, of the "fellowship" or "community" of society. <span class="cmt_word">To turn the kingdom of Saul to him</span> (so <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-14.htm">1 Chronicles 10:14</a>).

For there was joy in Israel. The joy must have been largely enhanced by the national consciousness of divided rule coming to an end, and of the cloud and frown of the Divine countenance having cleared mercifully away.
