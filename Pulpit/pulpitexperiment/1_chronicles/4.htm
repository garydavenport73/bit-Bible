The first verses follow in the direction already indicated in ch. 2, near the end of which we were left with Shobal and Haroeh, probably the same with Reaiah (the same name as Reaia, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:5</a>, though not the same person). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - The Carrot of ver. 1 is considered to lie doubtful between the Carmi of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-7.htm">1 Chronicles 2:7</a> or the Chelubai of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>, in which last alternation the five names of this verse would repeat the line of descent with which chrii, had made us familiar. Even then the object or advantage of repeating the first four of these, so far as what follows is concerned, is not evident. We keep near the close of ch. 2. also in respect of another allusion to the Zorathites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-53.htm">1 Chronicles 2:53</a>), whose families were replenished by the two sons of Jahath, Ahumai and Lahad, of all of whom this is all we know.

It was near Tekoah (ver. 5, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>) and Bethlehem (next verse). The hiatus in the first clause may possibly be supplied by "the families of" from the last verse, or, more fitly, by "the sons of," inasmuch as some manuscripts have it so. The Septuagint, however, and Vulgate <span class="accented">displace</span> "the father of" (<span class="accented">i.e. chief of</span>), replacing it by "the sons of." The Syriac Version leaves out any notice of the sister, Hazelelponi, and gives the former part of the verse thus: "These are Amina-dab's sons, Ahizareel, Nesma, and Dibas, Pheguel and Husia; These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratha, who was the father," etc. With this the Arabic Version is partly in agreement, but closes the verse with the words, "These are the sons of Hur, son of Ephratha, the father of whom [plural] was of Bethlehem." The Chronicle Targum translates, "the <span class="accented">rabbis dwelling at</span> Etam." This variety indicates the difficulty felt by each in turn. The verse, however, purports to give the names of three brothers and one sister (Hazelel-poni, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shadow looking at me, Gesenius) connected with Etam, as in the following verse Penuel with Gedor (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) and Ezer with Hushah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-29.htm">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>). Of no one of these, in all six other descendants of Hur, additional to those found at the close of ch. 2, is anything distinct known. It is to be noted that Hut himself is here called father of Bethlehem, while (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) his son Salma is so called.

The Roman Septuagint unaccountably gives different names to the mothers, and reverses the groups of the four and three children. Nothing else is known of these nine persons. The last two names of the group of four more resemble in form the name of the head of a family than an individual name; and for Jezoar, the middle name of the group of three, the easy Keri of "and Zohar" is followed by the Septuagint, and was followed by our 1611 Authorized Version.

The introduction of them, abrupt as it is, is, however, paralleled by many others ira-mediately following in this chapter, as well as elsewhere. Nothing has yet been produced in elucidation of any one of the persons designated by these names, or of their relation to the context. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">1 Chronicles 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This is not less true of the name of vers. 9, 10, which, however, has made its own mark amid the whole scene. The episode of these two verses, offering itself amid what should seem, superficially, a dry mass of dead names, is welcome and grateful as the oasis of the desert, and it warns us that life lies hidden at our every footfall on this ground, spread over though it is with monument and inscription, and hollow, as we thought, with the deadest of the dead. But the glimpse of old real life given us in this brief fragment of a biography is refreshing and is very suggestive. It seems an insufficient and unnatural method of accounting for the suddenness of the appearance of this episode to suppose ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in lee.</span>) that the name of Jahez was well known, from any cause, to those for whom Chronicles may be supposed to have been primarily intended. We prefer by far <span class="accented">one</span> account of it, viz. that the work in our hands is not in its original complete state; or, variously put, that it <span class="accented">is</span> in its uncompleted original state. No root corresponding to the characters of this name in present order is known; it is possible that some euphonic reason makes the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> out of the real word (future Kal) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he causes pains. We cannot suppose there would be any "play" appreciable on a transposition of alphabetical characters for <span class="accented">mere</span> play's sake. The resemblance that almost each part of this brief and abruptly introduced narration bears to incidents recorded in Genesis (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>) and Exodus speaks for itself, and strongly countenances the supposition that it is a genuine deposit of the genuinely olden history of Judah. The mother's reason for the naming of the child; the language and matter and form (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18-20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>) of the prayer of the child, when presumably he was no longer a child; and the discriminating use of the words <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (ver. 10) <span class="accented">of Israel</span>, as comps, red with the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; 5:41), generally found here, - all help to produce this impression, although some of these particulars would carry little conviction by themselves; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> a mother's reasons for assigning the name of her child long outlived the earlier times alone. Upon the whole, and regarding the passage in its present place, we may say that it must be very much <span class="accented">misplaced</span>, or else must be understood to connect Jabez with some branch of the family of Coz. There is the more room to assume this in the vagueness of the last preceding clause, "The families of Aharhel the son of Harum." The origin of the theories of some of the older Jewish writers, to the effect that Jabez was a doctor in the law, with a school of scribes around him, is probably to be found in the desire to find a connection between his proper name, Jabez, and the <span class="accented">place</span> so named (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>), and where, as we are told, "families of scribes dwelt," belonging to the Kenites. That these were connected with Bethlehem, through Salma, and that Jabez of our present passage was also of a family connected with Bethlehem, is worthy of notice, but is not enough by a long way to countenance the thought, in spite of Targum and Talmud (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>). The Targum, as well here as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>, identifies Jabez with Othniel "son of Keuaz" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>), or more probably "the Kenizzite" merely; but there is nothing to sustain such an identification. The description, he was more honourable than his brethren, finds a close parallel, so far as the word <span class="accented">honourable</span> goes, in <a href="../../par/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; although the honourableness of Shechem, the person there in question, does not come out to anything like the same advantage with that of Jabez, nor at all in the same direction. The word, however, is precisely the same, is often used elsewhere, and uniformly in a good sense, although the range of its application is wide. The essential idea of the root appears to be "weight." The phrase may therefore be supposed to answer to our expressive phrase, a "man of weight " <span class="accented">- the</span> weight being sometimes due <span class="accented">chiefly</span> to character, at other times to position and wealth in the first place, though not entirely divorced from considerations of character. We may safely judge, from what follows, that the intention in our present passage is to describe Jabez as a man of more ability and nobility than his brethren. It can scarcely be doubted that the meaning that lies on the surface is the correct interpretation, when it is said that his mother named him Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. The sorrow refers to unusual pains of travail, not to any attendant circumstances of domestic trial, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that the time of his birth was coincident with her own widowhood, as happened to the wife of Phinehas, when she named her offspring "Ichabod" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19-22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-10.htm">1 Chronicles 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep <i>me</i> from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - When Jabez grew to manhood he has learnt to estimate rightly the value of God's blessing. He invokes it, and depends upon it. His language implies the confidence that he had in the reality of providential blessing. For the expression, enlarge my coast, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-20.htm">Deuteronomy 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8</a>; and though we know nothing as matter of fact about the occasion of this prayer, we may assume that it was one when not selfishness and greed of larger territory, but just opportunity, had awakened a strong desire for enlargement of borders. It may have been a legitimate occasion of recovering his own, lost or wrongfully taken from him or his predecessors before him, or of expelling successfully from their hold upon it a portion of the original inhabitants of the promised land of God's people. That thine hand might be with me. Many are the beautiful parallels to be culled from the Word of God for this expression, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-5.htm">Psalm 139:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! This, the last entreaty of the prayer, is the largest and most far-seeing. Warned by his own name, forewarned by his mother's emphasizing of her own pains in him, he thus concludes. Having begun in the evil of pain and excessive sorrow, he prays that he and his career may not so determine and end. He does not necessarily pray to be preserved from all suffering, but from such baneful touch of evil itself, its principle, its tyrannous, merciless hold, as might bring him to real and irreparable grief. Thus closes the whole prayer, each succeeding clause of which has been under the rule of the initial "if," translated with us, Oh that. This well-known Hebrew form of prayer supposes a solemn engagement, and that the answered prayer shall meet with the fulfilment of a vowed promise on the part of the suppliant, according to the pattern of <a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>. In the absence of that engagement here, we may notice, with Keil, the greater grace of the passage, in that it closes with the statement of the readiness to <span class="accented">hear</span>, and the abounding readiness to <span class="accented">answer</span>, on the part of Divine beneficence: And God granted him that which he requested. Evidently the thing that he asked pleased the Lord (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10, 12</a>); although it was in this case some form of riches, and long life for self, and the life of his enemies, that he asked, and was <span class="accented">not</span> altogether and in so many words "a wise and understanding heart." Perhaps, also there was in the way of asking, and in the exact occasion, unknown to us, something which quite justified the matter of the prayer, and which thus pleased the Lord. The remarkable and arresting episode could not have closed in more welcome or impressive way than when it is thus briefly but conclusively said, "And God granted him that which he requested."

In the present instance, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, why should Othniel, if the younger brother and so expressly and repeatedly mentioned, be taken first?

The fact of the antithesis of the Jewess wife (by some assigned as wife to Ezra), and the presumably Egyptian wife mentioned in the latter verse, is perhaps just enough in the general obscurity to suggest that Mered, the asserted husband of the latter, is to be understood as the husband of the former also But to compass so much as this, we have to overlook omission in ver. 17 and inversion in ver. 18. There is a tone about the verses, due to names they contain, that might suggest to us the times of Egypt and Moses, and traditions in keeping do not fail to come to view in Jerome ('Quaestiones,' etc.; see also art. "Meted," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The four places, Eshtemoa, Gedor, Socho, Zanoah, may all with tolerable confidence be identified in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-58</a>, as of the number of the cities "in the mountains," though Zanoah and Socho are found also "in the valley" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a>).

It would appear now that Shelah gave the name of the slain brother to his son. Respecting this Er of Lecah - with little doubt the name of a place - and Laadah, nothing else can be adduced; but Marebah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>) is the name of a place in the <span class="accented">Shefelah</span>, given in the same passage with Kailah and Nezib (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>). The fine linen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>) here spoken of is, according to Gesenius, equivalent in this passage and in the later Hebrew, to the <span class="accented">byssus</span> of the Egyptians (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>), the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, from which the Syrian <span class="accented">byssus</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>), to which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> does more strictly apply, is distinguished in some other places. It was of fine texture, costly, and used as the clothing of kings (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>), of priests (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>), and of the very wealthy (<a href="../../par/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>). Gesenius says that, after long research and dispute, microscopic investigations in London have concluded that the threads of the cloth of <span class="accented">byssus</span> are linen, not cotton. Ashbea (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>) is not yet recognized elsewhere. Jokim. Gesenius considers this name (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) as a contracted form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Joiakim) of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a>. Chozeba. The meaning of this name is "lying;" not found elsewhere, it is probably the same as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, a town in the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), and <span class="accented">that is</span> probably the same as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;</span>, of the "valley" list of Judah cities (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>) and of <a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, where it is mentioned in near connection with the Mareshah, which also accompanies it in the above "valley" list. Joash. This name appears in three forms: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in the text and <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>. Seraph. This is the word the plural of which gives us our <span class="accented">seraphim</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), and is from a root of somewhat uncertain meaning. The different significations to which the root seems to lend itself in the substantive, according as it is used in the singular or plural, are startling (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub <span class="accented">voce</span>). The apparent meaning of this verse is that there was a time of old, when the above, of whom we can ascertain nothing elsewhere, ruled over Moab. Jerome, in the Vulgate, has made a strange rendering of this verse by translating some of the proper names, and reading at least one of them, the first, as though it were a form in the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which it is not: <span class="accented">Et qui stare fecit solem</span>, <span class="accented">virique Mendacii et Securus et Tircendens</span>, <span class="accented">qui principes fuerunt in Moab et qui reversi sunt in Lahem</span>; <span class="accented">haec autem verba vetera.</span> Thus Jokim is turned into Elimelech, and the men of Chozeba into Mahlon and Chillon of the Book of Ruth, and Jashubi-lehem into Naomi and Ruth; and the last clause of the verse is equivalent to citing the Book of Ruth. Barrington ('Genealogies,' 1:179) regards Jokim as Shelah's third son in this enumeration; and ethers regard Jashubi-lehem as his fourth son. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> and following the verb, is to be noted Ver. 23 brings us to the last of Judah, and leaves us to part with the account of the tribe in the same obscurity which has lately involved it. The plants and hedges are probably an instance of inopportune translation of proper names, which should rather appear as <span class="accented">Nelaira</span> and <span class="accented">Gedara</span>, the former place or people not found elsewhere, but the latter possibly referred to. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>. Again, <span class="accented">who</span> they were that were the potters, is not clear - whether all of the preceding verse, or the last mentioned. From the last clause it may be probably safely concluded, that those designated, whoever they were, were employed habitually in the service, not indeed of one king necessarily, but of the succession of royalty. Passages that may be taken to throw interesting light upon this subject are <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25-31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-29</a>.

That comparison shows six names in both of those passages for only five here, and it shows also difference in three of the names, viz. Jemuel, Zohar, and Jachin, for Nemuel, Zeta, and Jarib. On the other hand, the list of <a href="../../par/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12</a> is in exact agreement with our list here (the omission of Ohad in both being sufficiently accounted for by one and the same reason), with the exception of Jarib here for Jachin still there; and this solitary difference may justly be suspected to be nothing but an early corruption of <span class="accented">resh</span> for <span class="accented">caph</span> and <span class="accented">beth</span> for <span class="accented">nun</span> (see Kennicott, 'Diss.,' 1:178; Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:55). Ver. 25 contains three descents from one of these - Shaul. Of Shallum, the first, it may be noted that there are fourteen others of the same name in the Old Testament; and of Mibsam and Mishma (whom some call brothers, surely in error), that there were others of the same name (and certainly given as brothers), viz. the sons of Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; ch. 1:29). Ver. 26 adds apparently another three descents, viz. from Mishma. Of the first-named of these, Hamuel, it may be noted that the name appears in many Hebrew manuscripts as <span class="accented">Chammuel</span>; of the second-named, Zacchur, that six others of the same name (though the Authorized Version gives them Zaccur) are found in Numbers, the First Book of Chronicles, and Nehemiah; while on the third, Shimei (of which name the Old Testament contains fifteen others), our attention is especially detained as father of sixteen sons and six daughters, though it is observed that his brethren (query <span class="accented">Hammuel</span> and <span class="accented">Zacchur</span>) had not large families. The smallness of the whole tribe relatively to Judah, was only saved from being smaller by him. With this agrees the census of <a href="../../par/numbers/1-23.htm">Numbers 1:23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-4.htm">Numbers 2:4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>.

The allusion (ver. 31) to the reign of David is sufficiently explained by the fact that during his persecuted wanderings he was often in the portion of Simeon, to three of the cities of which he sent presents from the spoils of the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26-31</a>); and Ziklag became his own (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), special mention being made of how it passed into the tribe of Judah.

They were thirteen princes of the tribe of Simeon who led the movement, possibly representing respectively the "thirteen cities" given above. The movement took place in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah (B.C. 726-698). That the house of their fathers had increased greatly is probably mentioned as some explanation of the cause of the movement. Though in one name out of the thirteen (ver. 35) the ancestors are traced to the third generation, and in another (ver. 37) to the fifth, no name is reached of the sons of Simeon enumerated in vers. 24-27. These mentioned by names is to be translated strictly <span class="accented">these coming by names</span>; and it is open to question whether the word of ver. 41, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, be not omitted after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>; so that the passage would read, "These that came, written by names, were princes in their families."

There is a town of the name situated in the mountainous district of Judah between Halhul and Beth-zur, to the north of Hebron (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>). It is evident that this cannot be the place we require here. There is another town of the name (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a>), probably belonging to Benjamin, and which as little admits of being fitted in here. Both the Alexandrine and the Vatican Codex of the Septuagint, however, evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>. Now, Gerar of the Philistines would suit well for position and description, and also (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>) for the allusion found here (ver. 40) to the dwelling there "of old" of the people of Ham. The Hebrew word, however, generally applied to the valley of Gerar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, wady) is not the word used here of Gedor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, ravine). See Stanley's 'Syria and Palestine,' p. 159, and note. Not only are references frequent to the fertility of Gerar, but the significance of that in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a> speaks for itself. This alteration of reading, however, with acceptance of the Septuagint manuscripts, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and Keil ('Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) offers some suggestions of weight against those of Ewald, Bertheau, and others.

In doing this, our translators followed the Targum, copied by Luther and Junius (but see Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' 1002 a; 'Notes on Burckhardt,' 1069; Bertheau, in 'Chronik.;' and Septuagint reading).

Keil again ('Comm.,' in <span class="accented">loc</span>.) refers those intended to ver. 27, because he reads, for Ishi, the Shimei of ver. 27, on very insufficient grounds. It is a question whether the movement of ver. 42 is to be understood as arising out of that other the account of which closes in ver. 41, or whether it were not a co-ordinate movement. It still would probably enough spring from the same intrinsic causes. The allotment of the tribe of Simeon carved out of that of Judah was found too small for their growing numbers, though Simeon was not of the most numerous.
