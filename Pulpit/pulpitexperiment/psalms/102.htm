The allusion is probably to the former prosperity of the speaker, and of Israel generally, in their own land, and their present misery in Babylon (compare, however, <a href="../../par/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>).

The psalmist, like his nation, is old before his time; the shades of evening have come upon him, when he should have been in his midday brightness. And I am withered like grass (comp. ver. 4). The "I" here is emphatic (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>) - not only is the psalmist's heart withered, but he himself is altogether scorched and dried up.

God is said to "arise," when he bestirs himself to take vengeance on his enemies, and deliver his saints out of their hands. The "Zion," on which he would "have mercy," was not the city only, but the people belonging to it. For the time to favour her (or, <span class="accented">pity her</span>), yea, the set time, is come. By "the set time" is probably meant the time fixed by Jeremiah for the termination of the Captivity and the restoration of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>), and alluded to by Daniel in <a href="../../par/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>.
