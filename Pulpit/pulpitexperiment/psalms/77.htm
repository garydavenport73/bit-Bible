He thought of God, but the thought troubled him. It was God who had brought the calamity, whatever it was, upon his people. Seemingly, he had "cast them off" - he had "forgotten to be gracious" (see vers. 7-9). <span class="cmt_word">I complained;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">muse or meditate</span> (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And my spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">was overwhelmed;</span> or, <span class="accented">waxeth faint, as in</span> the Prayer book Version.

"Nessun maggior dolore che ricordarsi di tempo felice nella miseria." <span class="cmt_word">I commune with mine own heart, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">my spirit made diligent search;</span> or, "and I diligently searched out my spirit" (Cheyne).

Assuredly not. The higher nature in the psalmist, as Professor Cheyne observes, expostulates with the lower one. <span class="cmt_word">Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?</span> Has he shut them up, "as in a closed hand" (Kay, Canon Cook)? (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>).

But I will remember <span class="cmt_word">the years of the right</span> <span class="cmt_word">hand of the Most High</span>. There is no "I will remember" in the original, which expresses the thought of the writer imperfectly; but some such phrase must of necessity be supplied. The words are retained in the Revised Version and by Professor Cheyne. The remembrance of God's mercies during the many years that are past is that which best sustains us in a time of severe trouble.

They were weakness, vanity, nothingness. Jehovah alone was powerful. He could work, and could "work wonders." This clause prepares the way for the magnificent description of the deliverance of Israel at the Red Sea, which occupies vers. 16-19. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast declared thy strength among the people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among the peoples</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sight of many heathen nations (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>).

Professor Cheyne suggests that it is a geographical division - by Jacob southern Israel, and by Joseph northern Israel, being intended (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>).

But most commentators see in the passage a most essential portion of the poem. It is the thought of the deliverance from Egypt that especially sustains and comforts the psalmist in his extreme distress. The passage is prepared for by vers. 11 and 14, and is exegetical of ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">They were afraid.</span> They shrank from the sight of God, and made a way for his people to pass over. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">depths also were troubled</span>. The very abysses trembled with fear, and moved themselves, leaving the bottom of the sea dry (see <a href="../../par/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>).

The description here becomes more poetical than historical, unless, indeed, we may suppose that the writer possessed, besides what is said in Exodus, some traditional account of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">skies sent out a sound;</span> or, "uttered a voice" - the voice of the thunder, beyond a doubt (compare next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Thine arrows</span> <span class="cmt_word">also</span> <span class="cmt_word">went abroad;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lightnings darted hither and thither (see <a href="../../par/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-15.htm">2 Samuel 22:15</a>).

A storm of wind usually accompanies thunder and lightning. This the author, with poetical exaggeration, heightens into a "whirlwind" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/83-13.htm">Psalm 83:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lightnings lightened the world.</span> More hyperbole.
