He who has his thoughts always on God is said to "dwell in him" - to "make his abode with him" - to "sit down in his secret place." He has the Almighty, as it were, for his constant companion. <span class="cmt_word">Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</span> This is not "tautology." What is meant is that "loving faith on man's part shall be met by faithful love on God's part" (Kay). God will extend his "shadow" over the man who places himself under his protection.

The man who trusts in God will be specially protected in the peril of battle.

Parallels have been found in the literature of the Babylonians (see 'Babylonian and Oriental Record,' vol. 1, p. 12) and elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</span> The rare word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d8;&#x5d1;</span>, translated "destruction" here and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>, is rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and the entire phrase, "for the destruction that wasteth at noonday" becomes <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> - "from ruin and the demon of the midday" - by which sunstroke would seem to be meant (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>, "The sun shall not smite thee by day"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a></div><div class="verse">A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; <i>but</i> it shall not come nigh thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand.</span> The meaning is, "Though a thousand, or even ten thousand, should fall beside thee, in battle, or through pestilence, or sunstroke," yet - <span class="cmt_word">It shall not come nigh thee</span> - the danger, whatever it be, shall not touch thy person; thou shalt be protected from it.

It is supposed that a word - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;</span>- has dropped out, and that the verse originally ran thus: "Because <span class="accented">thou hast said</span>, Jehovah is my Refuge, and hast made the Most High thy Dwelling place" (comp. vers. l, 2). The second speaker for a second time addresses the first.

His very "dwelling" is to be protected so that his family may suffer no hurt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a></div><div class="verse">For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">ways</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>). The faithful are under the constant care of angels (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), who guide them and direct them perpetually. Satan made a crafty use of this promise when he tempted our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-10.htm">Luke 4:10, 11</a>). No doubt it applies to him pre-eminently, as the specially "Faithful One." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a></div><div class="verse">They shall bear thee up in <i>their</i> hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall bear thee up in their hands;</span> rather, <span class="accented">upon their hands</span> - lifting thee over difficulties and stumbling blocks. <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou dash thy foot against a</span>  <span class="cmt_word">stone</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23, 24</a>). Moral impediments are, no doubt, chiefly meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder.</span> Conquered enemies prostrated themselves before their conquerors, who, to mark the completeness of the subjection, placed a foot upon the prostrate form. From this practice the metaphor of "treading under foot" for conquering became a commonplace (see <a href="../../par/psalms/7-5.htm">Psalm 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12</a>, etc.). The "lion" here represents all open and violent foes; the "adder," all secret and malignant ones. <span class="cmt_word">The young lion</span> (<span class="accented">kephir</span>, the lion in the height of his strength) <span class="cmt_word">and the dragon</span> (<span class="accented">tannin</span>, the most dreadful form of serpent) <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou trample under feet.</span> An emphatic repetition, with a certain heightening of the colour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14</a></div><div class="verse">Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because he hath set his love upon me</span> (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>). "By a sudden and effective transition," as Professor Cheyne remarks, "Jehovah becomes the speaker" of the concluding strophe. It is not enough that the faithful should encourage each other by their anticipations of God's coming mercies, God himself now speaks by the mouth of his prophet, and makes promises in his own Person. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver him</span>. A ratification of vers. 3, 7, 10-15. <span class="cmt_word">I will set him on high;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "exalt him above his fellows" - "bring him to honour." <span class="cmt_word">Because he hath known my Name.</span> "Knowing God's Name" is nearly equivalent to knowing him. It implies, besides knowledge, faith and trust in the Almighty.

I will be <span class="cmt_word">with him in trouble</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver him</span> (see above, ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">And honour him;</span> or, "bring him to honour" (compare "I will set him on high," in the preceding verse).
