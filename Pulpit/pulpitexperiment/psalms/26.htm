It seems to Christians a bold act to call on God for judgment, but the saints of the earlier dispensation, having, perhaps, a less keen sense of human imperfection, were wont to do so. It is Job's cry from his first utterance until his "words are ended;" and here we find David taking it up and re-echoing it. Man longs to hear the sentence of acquittal from the great Judge. Like Job, David asserts his "integrity," and in the same qualified sense. He is sincere in his endeavours to do right. Yet still he needs mercy and redemption (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">I have trusted also in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord; therefore I shall not slide.</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-36.htm">Psalm 18:36</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>). David is confident of his past; for the future he trusts in God to uphold his steps, and save him from slips and falls. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a></div><div class="verse">Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Examine me, O Lord, and prove me</span>. He desires to be examined and proved  - tested, as a metal is tested (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>) - that his sincerity may fully appear. <span class="cmt_word">Try my reins and my heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my emotional and my intellectual natures. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-3.htm">Psalm 26:3</a></div><div class="verse">For thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes.</span> The psalmist now enters upon an enumeration of the points of conduct on which his confidence in his integrity rests. They are six - three positive and three negative. First of all, he keeps God's loving-kindness, or mercy (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>), ever before his eyes - reflects on it, meditates on it, presents it to his thought - continually. <span class="cmt_word">And I have walked in thy truth.</span> Secondly, he walks - he has always walked - in God s truth. God's Law is the truth (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-42.htm">Psalm 119:42</a>); and walking in God's truth is walking in the Law which he has given to men; as Hitzig, Maurer, and others have seen. Hengstenberg's exposition, "I have constantly thought upon thy faithfulness," cannot be admitted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a></div><div class="verse">I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not sat with vain</span> <span class="cmt_word">persons.</span> Thirdly, he has not sat with vain persons; literally, <span class="accented">with men of vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he has not consorted (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>) with light and frivolous persons - those whose hearts are set upon vain and worthless things (see <a href="../../par/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, and the comment). Neither will I go in with dissemblers. Nor will he go in with (nor has he, we may conclude, gone in with) dissemblers, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hypocrites. He has neither thrown in his lot with the light, vain persons who make no pretence to religion, nor with the pretenders, who "have the form of godliness, but deny the power thereof" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-5.htm">Psalm 26:5</a></div><div class="verse">I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have hated the</span> <span class="cmt_word">congregation</span> of evil-doers. Fifthly, he has hated, and hates, with a holy and strong abhorrence (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-22.htm">Psalm 139:22</a>), the congregation of evil-deers - the gatherings and assemblies of those who meet only for wicked purposes  - to sin themselves, and to draw others into like evil courses. This is a positive trait of a very marked character, and goes far beyond the explanation which has been given of it: "I take no part in assemblies for the ruin of others" (Hengstenberg). Sixthly and lastly, <span class="cmt_word">he will not sit with the wicked</span>. This only goes beyond the declarations in ver. 4 by extending to all wicked persons of every kind the avoidance there limited to "vain persons," and "dissemblers." The spirit is that indicated by Jacob in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>; by St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9-11</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-7.htm">Ephesians 5:7, 11</a>; and by St. John, on the celebrated occasion when he avoided contact with Cerinthus (Iren., 3:3, &sect; 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will wash mine hands in innoceney; so will I compass thine altar, O Lord.</span> This seems to be the key-note of the psalm. If not a necessary, it is at any rate a probable, exegesis, that David composed this psalm on an occasion when he was about to offer a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to God for some mercy recently vouchsafed him (ver. 7). Before offering, he feels the necessity of doing spiritually that which the priest' who officiated would have to do ceremonially (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>)  - to "wash his hands in innocency, and so to go to God's altar." His self-justification from ver. 1 to ver. 5 has had for its object to clear him from guilt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-7.htm">Psalm 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving</span>; rather, to <span class="accented">sound forth the voice of thanksgiving</span> (Kay); or, <span class="accented">to make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard</span> (Revised Version). And tell of all thy wondrous works; or, <span class="accented">recount them</span>, <span class="accented">enumerate them.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the <span class="accented">home</span> that thy house affords me." It has been my delight to  remain there, to pass long hours there, as it were to dwell there (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>). And the place where thine honour dwelleth; literally, the place <span class="accented">of the tabernacling of thy glory</span> - the place where thy glory - the <span class="accented">Shechinah</span> - is enshrined and abides. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-9.htm">Psalm 26:9</a></div><div class="verse">Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Gather not my soul with sinners</span>. Unite me not in one doom with open sinners  - those with whom I have always refused to consort (vers. 4, 5) - whose congregation I have "hated." "That the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor my life with bloody men</span>. Bloody men - literally, <span class="accented">men of bloods</span> - <span class="accented">are</span> the worst of wicked men, cut-throats, assassins, murderers. At any rate, put me not on a par with them. Little, probably, did the psalmist think at this time how soon he was to become, practically, a murderer, and to "slay Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the children of Ammon" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>)

Had he but kept to it! <span class="cmt_word">Redeem me, and be merciful unto me</span> (compare the comment on ver. 1). Though hitherto he has walked innocently, and is resolved still to continue to walk innocently; he nevertheless feels that he has need of redeeming mercy. Though he "knows nothing by himself, yet he is not thereby justified" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Many, doubtless, are his "secret sins," which God has "set in the light of his countenance" (<a href="../../par/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My foot standeth in an even place</span>; or, on <span class="accented">level ground</span> - <span class="accented">where</span> there is nothing to cause me to stumble (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the congregations will I bless the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the assemblies of the people for public worship.

Indeed, it is the general idea that underlies all his psalms of praise, since they wore composed to be recited in the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/25.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 25"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 25" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/27.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 27"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 27" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
