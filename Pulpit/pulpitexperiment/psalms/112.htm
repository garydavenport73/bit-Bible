Again a "heading," or "introduction" (see the comment on Psalm 111:1). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord</span>. Connect this with <a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>. The closing thought of <a href="../../par/psalms/111.htm">Psalm 111</a>. is taken up and expanded in <a href="../../par/psalms/112.htm">Psalm 112</a>. That <span class="cmt_word">delighteth greatly in his commandments</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-16.htm">Psalm 119:16, 17, 24, 70, 77</a>, etc.). "True obedience can only come from pleasure in the commandments of God" (Hengstenberg). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a></div><div class="verse">His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His seed shall be mighty upon earth</span>. The phrase <span class="accented">used</span> of Nimrod in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>, but not necessarily to be taken in exactly the same sense; rather as <span class="accented">gibor</span> <span class="accented">hail</span>  in <a href="../../par/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>, "wealthy, prosperous." <span class="cmt_word">The generation of the upright shall be blessed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, shall receive blessing from the Most High, and shall therefore prosper. To be blessed in one's seed was, under the old covenant, the highest of blessings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a></div><div class="verse">Wealth and riches <i>shall be</i> in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wealth and riches</span> shall be in his house. Bishop Butler has well shown how, in God's moral government of the world, virtue tends to accumulate to itself the good things of this life, and vice to disperse and dissipate them ('Analogy,' pt. 1. <a href="../../par/psalms/3.htm">Psalm 3</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his righteousness endureth forever</span>. Human goodness - here called "righteousness" is a thing which does not change, since character is formed by habits, and habits are "a second nature." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a></div><div class="verse">Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: <i>he is</i> gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness</span>. God's Word is "a lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their paths" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>) - sufficient under most circumstances to guide their steps aright. When this is not enough, he vouchsafes an inward light to them (<a href="../../par/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous</span>. It is a very forced interpretation to understand this as said of Jehovah. The entire subject of the psalm is the righteous, God-like <span class="accented">man</span>. In him are reflected shadows of all the Divine qualities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a></div><div class="verse">A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good man showeth favor, and lendeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">well is it with the man that showeth</span>, etc. The verse is exegetical of the latter clause of ver. 4, and shows how the righteous man's compassion works. It makes him "show favor," or "kindness," to men generally, and "lend" to those who are in necessity (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>; and for the duty of lending to the needy, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-8.htm">Deuteronomy 15:8, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will guide his affairs with discretion</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">with equity</span>. Scarcely, as Professor Cheyne suggests, "in courts of justice." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a></div><div class="verse">Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely he shall not be moved forever.</span> God's blessing shall abide with him, and make his happiness sure and stable. (On stability as a necessary element in happiness, see Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 1. 10. &sect; 7, 8.) <span class="cmt_word">The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. everlastingly remembered by God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a></div><div class="verse">He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not be afraid of evil tidings</span>. Confident in God's goodness to wards him, he will not anticipate misfortunes. They may come, as even the best man is not exempt from them; but he will not meet them half-way. <span class="cmt_word">His heart is fixed</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. firmly established (see ver. 8) - settled on a sure basis - <span class="cmt_word">trusting in the Lord</span> - the one basis that is solid and immovable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a></div><div class="verse">His heart <i>is</i> established, he shall not be afraid, until he see <i>his desire</i> upon his enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His heart is established</span>. Almost a repetition of the phrase in ver. 7, "his heart is fixed" - seemingly, therefore, superfluous, but really emphasizing the point, which is of great moment (see the comment of Hengstenberg, and compare the "just man" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:3, 2. 1-8). <span class="cmt_word">He shall not be afraid</span>. "Perfect love casteth out fear" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). He who feels himself always and altogether in the hands of a loving Father cannot be afraid of what is about to befall him. <span class="cmt_word">Until he see his desire upon his enemies</span>. He knows that his enemies have no real power to harm him, and that ultimately he will "see his desire upon them;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will triumph over them (see <a href="../../par/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a></div><div class="verse">He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor</span>. There is no virtue in mere "dispersing," since spendthrifts" disperse" even more lavishly than virtuous men. The only laudable "dispersing" is that which has for its object the relief of distress, and which (it may be added) is wisely directed to that object. <span class="cmt_word">His righteousness endureth forever</span> (see the comment on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">His horn shall be exalted with honor</span>. The esteem of men, on the whole, follows upon goodness, and the righteous obtain more honor than others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/112-10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a></div><div class="verse">The wicked shall see <i>it</i>, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked shall see it, and be grieved</span>. The wicked hate the righteous (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-25.htm">Psalm 105:25</a>), and are naturally "grieved" to see them prosper. "When shall he die, and his name perish?" is the thought of their heart against the godly man. <span class="cmt_word">He shall gnash with his teeth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-16.htm">Psalm 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-16.htm">Lamentations 2:16</a>: <a href="../../par/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>). Civilization represses these emotional displays, but the feeling remains nevertheless. <span class="cmt_word">And melt away</span>; or, "consume away" - "waste away" - through envy and hate. <span class="cmt_word">The desire of the wicked shall perish</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). "The desire of the wicked" - that which they earnestly long for, which is the downfall and destruction of the righteous - does not come to pass, but falls to the ground, "perishes," comes to naught. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/111.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 111"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 111" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/113.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 113"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 113" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
