Dr. Kay, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version render "proudly;" Professor Cheyne, "with high looks."

This is at once the refrain and the keynote of the psalm. In all dangers, in all troubles, whatever happens, whatever seems to be impending, the  psalmist will never relinquish his trust in the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</span> This is the true martyr spirit. Compare our Lord's words, "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).

As Canon Cook says, "This description is singularly applicable to David's position among the envious nobles at the court of Achish Still, it does not speak of his having been actually arrested, and does not, therefore, seem to have suggested the inscription." <span class="cmt_word">All their thoughts are against his for evil.</span> They are entirely bent on doing the psalmist some hurt. What they really seek is his life (ver. 6); but, short of that, they would gladly do him some mischief.

Assuredly not. God will prevent such an escape. <span class="cmt_word">In thine anger cast down the people, O God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the peoples; i.e.</span> the heathen generally, to whom David's enemies, the Gittites, belong. Though assured that they will not escape, the psalmist, to make assurance doubly sure, prays that they may not. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: <i>are they</i> not in thy book?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou tellest my wanderings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou, O God, takest account of my wretched wandering life (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21-30</a>), and notest each occasion when I am forced to move from one city, or cave, or wilderness to another. <span class="cmt_word">Put thou my tears into thy bottle.</span> Take also note of my tears - let them not pass unheeded. Rather, gather them drop by drop, and store them, as costly wine is stored, in a flask. The thought, thus dressed in a metaphor, was, no doubt (as Professor Cheyne observes), "Store them up in thy memory." <span class="cmt_word">Are they not in thy book? </span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hast thou not anticipated my request, and entered an account of every tear that I have shed, in thy book of records (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>)?

These vows he considers to be now due, and himself to be under the obligation of paying them. Accordingly, he announces his intention of speedily discharging his obligation - <span class="cmt_word">I will render praises</span> (rather, <span class="accented">thank offerings</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto thee.</span>
