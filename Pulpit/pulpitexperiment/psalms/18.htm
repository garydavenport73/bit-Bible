The verb translated "I will love" expresses the very tenderest affection, and is elsewhere never used to denote the love of man towards God, but only that of God towards man. The entire verse, moreover, is withdrawn from the "second edition" of the psalm (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.) - which was perhaps prepared for liturgical use - as too sacred and too private to suit a public occasion.

Here begins the narrative of David's sufferings in the past. "'The sorrows' - or rather, 'the cords' - of death," he says, "encompassed me," or "coiled around me" (Kay). Death is represented as a hunter, who goes out with nets and cords, encompassing his victims and driving them into the toils. David's recollection is probably of the time when he was "hunted upon the mountains" by Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>), and expected continually to be caught and put to death (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-15.htm">1 Samuel 23:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the floods of ungodlymen made me afraid</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the torrents of Belial</span>, or  <span class="accented">of ungodliness.</span> The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Streams of ungodly men, the myrmidons of Saul, cut him off from escape. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sorrows of hell compassed me about</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the cords of Sheol</span>, or Hades. Death and Hell are, both of them, personified, and made to join in the chase. The ensnaring nets are drawn nearer and nearer; at last the toils close in, the last cast is made, and the prey is taken. <span class="cmt_word">The snares of death prevented me</span>; or, <span class="accented">came upon me</span> (Revised Version) - "took me by surprise" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <i>even</i> into his ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In my distress I called upon the Lord,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and cried unto my God.</span> At this supreme moment, when he is entangled in the snares, and on the point of being slain, the psalmist represents himself as invoking the aid of the Almighty. As HengstenBerg notes, "While the manifold distresses are united in the beginning of the verse into one great 'distress,' so the manifold Divine hearings and helps are united into a single grand hearing and help" - and, we may add, the manifold cries into one great cry. <span class="cmt_word">He heard my voice out of his temple;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his tabernacle, since the temple was not yet built (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>); or perhaps, "out of heaven "(Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And my cry came before him, even into his ears</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, where the same word is used for the "cry" of the children of Israel in Egypt). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the earth shook and trembled</span>; or, <span class="accented">quailed and quaked</span> (Kay, who thus expresses the assonance of the Hebrew <span class="accented">vat-tig'ash vat-tir</span> <span class="accented">ash</span>). The psalmist must not be understood literally. He does not mean that the deliverance came by earthquake, storm, and thunder, but describes the discomfiture and dismay of his opponents by a series of highly poetical images. In these he, no doubt, follows nature closely, and probably describes what he had seen, heard, and felt. <span class="cmt_word">The foundations also of the hills</span> <span class="cmt_word">moved and were shaken.</span> In violent earthquakes, the earth seems to rock to its foundations; mountain ranges are sometimes actually elevated to a height of several feet; rocks topple down; and occasionally there are earth-slips of enormous dimensions. <span class="cmt_word">Because he was wroth.</span> God's anger against the psalmist's enemies produced the entire disturbance which he is describing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils</span>. Emissions of smoke are a common feature of volcanic disturbances, with which earthquakes are closely connected. The LXX. give, instead of "out of his nostrils," <span class="accented">in his anger</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), which is better, since the Hebrew prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;</span>, "in," certainly cannot mean "out of." <span class="cmt_word">And fire out of his mouth devoured.</span> Fire-balls are said to have accompanied some earthquakes, as especially that one by which Julian's design of rebuilding Jerusalem was frustrated. <span class="cmt_word">Coals were kindled by it</span>. The fire-balls above spoken of are declared to have scorched and burnt the workmen employed by Julian (Amm. Marc., 23. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He bowed the heavens also, and came down</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>). In a storm the clouds do actually descend, and the whole heaven seems to be bowed down to earth. God is said to "come down" to earth whenever he delivers the oppressed, and takes vengeance on their oppressors (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-10.htm">2 Samuel 22:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64.htm">Isaiah 64</a>. I, 3, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And darkness was under his feet.</span> A deep darkness commonly accompanies both earthquake and storm. When God actually descended on Mount Sinai, it was amid thunders and lightnings, and "a thick cloud" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>), elsewhere called "thick darkness" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly</span>. The imagery here transcends all experience, and scarcely admits of comment or explanation. God is represented as borne through the heavens, as he proceeds to execute his purposes, by the highest of his creatures, the cherubim. Elsewhere (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>) he sails through the sky supported on clouds. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he sped swiftly</span> (Kay). The verb used is different from that translated "did fly" in the preceding verse. It is applied elsewhere especially to the eagle (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>).

In executing his judgments he did not allow himself to be seen. God's action is always secret and inscrutable. <span class="cmt_word">His pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> The original runs as follows: "He made darkness his secret place - his pavilion round about him - dark waters, thick clouds of the skies." The whole forms one sentence, "his pavilion" being in apposition with "secret place," and the last clause, "dark waters, thick clouds of the skies," being exegetical of the "darkness" in the first clause. God's "pavilion," or "tent" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>), is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a> and Psalm 31:20.

The "thick clouds" are riven and parted asunder for the lightning to burst forth. Then come, almost simultaneously, hail stones and coals of fire; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hail like that which fell in Egypt before the Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-34</a>), when "there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail" (ver. 24) - a fire which "ran along upon the  ground," or some very unusual electrical phenomenon (see the comment on Exodus in the ' Homiletic Commentary,' p. 208). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice.</span> With the lightning came, necessarily, thunder, rolling along the heavens, and seeming like the voice of God (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4, 5</a>). Hail stones and coals of fire. The phrase is repeated for the sake of emphasis. The hail and the lightning are represented as conjointly the ministers of the Divine vengeance.

God's "arrows" are often spoken cf. Job felt them within him (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). David has already said of them, that they are "ordained against the persecutors" (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). We may understand by the expression any sharp pains, mental or bodily, which God sends<span class="cmt_word">. And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> The effect of the tempest of God's wrath is to "scatter" and "discomfit" the enemy (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). Instead of" and he shot out lightnings," our Revisers give, <span class="accented">and lightnings manifold</span>, which is perhaps better.

B</span>y "the channels of waters" seem to be meant the torrent-courses, so common in Palestine, especially on either side of Jordan, which convey into it the winter rains.

Some commentators see in the words used - "he <span class="accented">sent</span>, he <span class="accented">took</span> me, he <span class="accented">drew</span> me" - a tacit reference to <a href="../../par/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5, 10</a>, and, by implication, a sort of parallel between the deliverance of David from his foes and that of Moses from the waters of the Nile (Kay, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary').

This is generally understood of Saul.

He begins by summing up all in a word, "God <span class="accented">delighted</span> in him." He then goes on to explain the causes of God's "delight" (vers. 20-26).

David has spoken of his "righteousness" already in <a href="../../par/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>.

He means honesty of purpose, the sincere endeavour to do right, such conduct as brings about "the answer of a good conscience before God" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the cleanness of my hands hath he</span> <span class="cmt_word">recompensed me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/27-9.htm">Job 27:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>).

And have not wickedly departed from my God. It is observed that the word translated by "departed wickedly" implies "wilful and persistent wickedness" ('Speaker's Commentary') - "an entire alienation from God" (Calvin). Not even in the humblest of the penitential psalms, when David is bewailing his great offence, does he use this verb of himself. He is an example to all men not to indulge in a false humility, nor employ phrases concerning himself which go beyond the truth.

But what sin this was, we have no means of determining.

The main principle is that God will act towards men as they act towards him.

The reason is well explained in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "In dealing with the good, God shows his approval by manifesting attributes similar or identical in essence; in dealing with the wicked, he exhibits attributes which are correlative - in just proportion to their acts," but not identical. God cannot "show himself froward" - he can only show himself opposed, antagonistic, an adversary. What the psalmist means to say is that, if men oppose and thwart God, he in return will oppose and thwart them. But they will act in a perverse spirit, he in a spirit of justice and righteousness.

And both alike attributed the downfall of the proud to God. "Seest thou," says Herodotus, "how God with his lightning smites always the bigger animals, and will not suffer them to wax insolent, while those of a lesser bulk chafe him not? How likewise his bolts ever fall on the highest houses and the tallest trees? So plainly does he love to bring down everything that exalts itself.

The sons also of them that afflict thee shall <span class="accented">come kneeling</span> unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall <span class="accented">bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet</span>, and they shall call thee, The city of the Holy One of Israel" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12-14</a>; see also <a href="../../par/micah/7-16.htm">Micah 7:16, 17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46-50.</span> - This glorious and triumphant psalm concludes with a solemn ascription of praise, blessing, and thanksgiving to Almighty God - partly recapitulation of what has preceded (vers. 47, 48), partly additional (vers. 46, 49, 50). Terms of praise are accumulated, and the whole is made to culminate in a Messianic burst, where David is swallowed up in his "Seed;" and the "Anointed King" presented to our view is rather the antitype than the type - rather Christ Jesus than the son of Jesse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord liveth</span>. God was known to Israel as "the living God" from the time of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). The epithet exalted him above all other so-called gods, who were not living (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>). But it had also a very precious, absolute meaning. God's life was the source of man's. It was through God (who had life in himself) breathing into man the breath of life that man became a living soul (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Hence "the living God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>) is "the God of our life" (<a href="../../par/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And blessed be my Rock</span> (see vers. 1, 31). In blessing "his Rock," David blesses God for his qualities of firmness, steadfastness,  and trustworthiness. And let the God of my salvation be exalted. "The God of my salvation" is a favourite phrase with David (see <a href="../../par/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a>). Other writers use it rarely. When David prays that the God of his salvation (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who continually saves him and preserves him) may be "exalted," he probably desires that he may be praised and honoured of all men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-47.htm">Psalm 18:47</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is God that avengeth me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the God avengeth me</span> (comp. vers. 3, 6, 14, 17, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And subdueth the people under me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the peoples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nations (comp. vers. 37-42). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a></div><div class="verse">He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He delivereth me from mine enemies</span>. The "deliverance" was especially from domestic foes (see vers. 17, 19). His foreign foes seem never to have brought David into much peril. Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me. The "lifting up" was above enemies of both kinds (see ver. 43). Thou hast delivered me from the violent man (comp. ver. 17). There is no reason to doubt that in both places Saul is intended. He was at once David's "enemy," and a "man of violence." Were the question open otherwise, it would be closed by the statement in the title. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen</span>. As, in some sense, "the <span class="accented">head</span> of the heathen" (ver. 43), David was bound to offer prayer, and praise, and thanksgiving "among them," if it were only to teach them by his example, and lead them on towards the worship of the true God. And sing praises unto thy Name; <span class="accented">i.e. to thy Person</span> - God being in his Name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a></div><div class="verse">Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great deliverance giveth he to his king</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he magnifies salutations to his king.</span> The primary reference seems to be to the gracious message which God sent to David by Nathan when he had brought the tabernacle into Jerusalem, and purposed to build a "house" worthy of it (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). God had then "saluted" David as "his servant" (ver. 5), and sent him a message of the most gracious character, even promising the kingdom to him and to his seed "for ever" (vers. 13, 16). <span class="cmt_word">And showeth mercy to his anointed, to David</span>. No doubt David is primarily intended, both by the "king" of the first clause, and by the "anointed" of the second; but the combination of the two, and the immediate mention of the "seed" which is to reign "for ever," carry the passage beyond the psalmist individually, and give to the conclusion of the psalm, at any rate, a semi-Messianic character. As Hengstenberg says, "Psalms of this kind are distinguished from those which may more strictly be called Messianic, only by this - that in the latter the Messiah <span class="accented">exclusively</span> is brought into view, while here he is presented to our notice only as a member of the seed of David" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 324, Engl. trans.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
