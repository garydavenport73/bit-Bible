He will cause the Gentiles to flock into his Church, even those who have been hitherto the most bitter enemies of Israel (ver. 4), and will place these strangers on a par with such as have belonged to his Church from their birth (vers. 4, 5, 6), admitting them to every blessing and every privilege. The Church, thus augmented, shall be taken under his own protection, and "established," or placed on a sure footing, forever. Compare our Lord's promise to St. Peter," On this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will make mention of Rahab;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Egypt.

Literally "Rahab" means "pride, arrogance." <span class="cmt_word">And Babylon.</span> The fitting counterpart of Egypt, equally antagonistic to Israel, and equally lifted up with pride and presumption. <span class="cmt_word">To them that know me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among them that know me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as belonging to them, included in their number (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-21.htm">Isaiah 19:21</a>, "And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians <span class="accented">shall know the Lord</span> in that day;" and see also <a href="../../par/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/82-8.htm">Psalm 82:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia</span>.

The psalmist intends to represent the converted nations as coming in a grand procession, with songs and dances, to celebrate their admission to Zion, and there one and all exclaiming, All my fresh springs - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all my sources of life, and joy, and happiness" - are in thee.
