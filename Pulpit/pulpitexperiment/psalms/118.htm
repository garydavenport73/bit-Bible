Israel, on its return from the Captivity, had begun by putting a good deal of trust in its human helpers, as Cyrus and the other friendly heathen mentioned in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-4.htm">Ezra 1:4-6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>. But this help, after a little time, had failed them (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-24</a>), and they had found themselves in great difficulties.

The "princes" after Cyrus had proved "broken reeds," and, instead of favoring Israel, had favored Israel's enemies (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6-24</a>). At last Darius had done them justice, but it was felt that no sure dependence could be placed either on him or on his successors. Jehovah alone was Israel's safe ground of confidence, He "would not fail them, nor forsake them" (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a></div><div class="verse">All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All nations compassed me about</span>. This is, of course, hyperbole. But it was a fact that all, or almost all, the nations among whom the Israelites dwelt were at all times hostile to them, and sought their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">But in the Name of the Lord will I destroy them</span>; or, "I will mow them down" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>).

The special compassing about alluded to is probably that in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, when not only the Babylonians but the Syrians, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Edomites took part in hostilities against Israel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.</span> The threefold repetition of this trenchant phrase (vers. 10, 11, 12) lends it vast additional force. It is no casual utterance, no mere wish, or thought begotten of a wish, but a deep and firm conviction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a></div><div class="verse">They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They compassed me about like bees</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in vast numbers, and with intense energy, and a furious desire to injure (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; and the powerful description of Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:236-238). <span class="cmt_word">They are quenched as the fire of thorns</span>. Their fury dies away and goes out suddenly, like a fire kindled among thorns, which blazes up with vast heat and noise, but in a short time dies down and disappears. <span class="cmt_word">For in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them</span> (see the comment on ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast thrust lore at me that I might fall</span>; rather, thou didst thrust (Revised Version). The psalmist recalls the past, and throws himself, as it were, once more into the midst of the struggle. Thou - mine enemy, Babylon - didst make s desperate onset upon me, fully intending my destruction. <span class="cmt_word">But the Lord helped me</span>. Frustrated thy purpose - preserved the life, the national life, which thou aimedst at destroying, and so did most effectually "help me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my strength and my song, and is become my salvation.</span> The deliverance was such that no words but those of the Song of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>) could fitly celebrate it.

"Tabernacles," or "tents," is continually used by the sacred writers as a synonym for "dwellings." The use of the expression here by no means implies that the Israelites of the time were actually living in tents. <span class="cmt_word">The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly</span> (scrap. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6, 12</a>). God's right hand was at the time stretched out to protect and preserve Israel.

When God's right hand effects a deliverance, it gets, as it were, additional glory to itself. <span class="cmt_word">The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly</span>. So, already, in ver. 16. Repetition is a special characteristic of this psalm (see vers. 1, 2, 3, 4; vers. 8, 9; vers. 10-12, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a></div><div class="verse">I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I shall not die, but live</span>. The psalmist speaks, not in his own person, but in the name of his nation. They had been brought very near to extinction; but now the danger was past. God had given them "a reviving" (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8, 9</a>); and they felt that henceforth they would "live." <span class="cmt_word">And declare the works of the Lord.</span> They would employ the new life granted them in "declaring God's works" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4-6</a>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they would witness to all men of "the might of his marvelous acts," and "abundantly utter the memory of his great goodness."

The great gate of the temple being now reached, admission to the interior is requested. The gates are called "the gates of righteousness," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as gates which none but the righteous ought to enter (see the next verse); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as gates through which access is gained to the sanctuary of him who alone is truly righteous, and the source of all righteousness in others. <span class="cmt_word">I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord</span>. Praise could be given to God any where; but it was most appropriately offered "in the courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/psalms/116-19.htm">Psalm 116:19</a>).

"This verse seems to stand apart - a solo, chanted by a voice out of the temple gate" (Kay). Though sinners doubtless sometimes entered (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-13.htm">2 Kings 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>), none but the righteous had any right to enter.

Any Messianic reference is secondary and subordinate.

This fresh elevation of Israel to importance - especially to such great importance - can only be attributed to the work of Divine providence. It is "the Lord's doing" - literally, "from the Lord" - and is one of the most marvelous events of history. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the day <i>which</i> the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the day which the Lord hath made</span>.

Israel feels its constant dependence upon God, and that if the Divine care were remitted for a day, or for an hour, all would be lost.

Having received the priestly benediction, the processionists resume their strain. They have entered within the courts; they are approaching the altar of sacrifice; they have brought their offering. "Jehovah," they say, "is God, and hath given us light" (see the Revised Version). That is, he has enlightened our spirits to see and acknowledge his mercies; or, perhaps, he has led us, as he did the people, by a pillar of fire in the wilderness; and now we stand before the altar with our offering - <span class="cmt_word">receive it at our hands, ye priests-and bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</span> So shalt the act of thanksgiving be complete, and the solemn service ended. The fanciful exposition of Luther, lately revived by Professor Cheyne, will scarcely approve itself to critics generally.
