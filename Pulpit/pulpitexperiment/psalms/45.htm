It is noted that only "psalms of high and solemn import" have formal exordia of this kind, announcing the intention of the writer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art fairer than the children of men</span>. It has been argued that a description of the Messiah would not lay stress on his personal beauty. But in the Song of Songs the personal beauty of the bridegroom, whom so many critics regard as the Messiah, is a main point (<a href="../../par/songs/5-10.htm">Song of Solomon 5:10-16</a>). A perfect man, such as Messiah was to be, must needs be beautiful, at any rate with a beauty of expression. In calling his bridegroom "<span class="accented">fair beyond the sons of men</span>," the writer at once gives us to understand that he is not a mere man. Grace is poured into thy lips; rather, <span class="accented">grace is poured out on thy lips</span> (Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Kay). The gift of gracious expression and gracious speech has been poured upon him from on high (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/5-16.htm">Song of Solomon 5:16</a>, "His mouth is most sweet"). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</span> The gifts bestowed upon him show the Divine favor and blessing, which, once granted, are not capriciously withdrawn. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a></div><div class="verse">Gird thy sword upon <i>thy</i> thigh, O <i>most</i> mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> array thyself as a warrior, for thou wilt have enemies to conquer, and wilt need a sword against them (see vers. 4, 5). <span class="cmt_word">With thy glory and thy majesty</span>. There is no "with" in the original. Some think his sword is called Messiah's "glory and majesty." Others supply "put on," as implied in the "gird" of the first clause, and translate, "Put on thy glory and thy majesty;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> show thyself in all the majesty and glory that naturally belong to thee. This is quite in accordance with the context. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a></div><div class="verse">And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness <i>and</i> righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in thy majesty ride prosperously</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and in thy majesty go forth</span>, <span class="accented">ride.</span> The riding intended is probably riding in a chariot. <span class="cmt_word">Because of truth and meekness and righteousness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of truth and meek-tempered righteoushess</span> (Kay); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the purpose of vindicating truth and righteousness in the case of those who outrage them. Righteousness, however, to be really righteousness, must be combined with meekness (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things</span>. It is the right hand wherewith the warrior strikes; and at each blow it opens to the striker terrible experiences, and thus may be said to "teach him terrible things." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thine arrows <i>are</i> sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; <i>whereby</i> the people fall under thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee</span>. The original is more graphic. It runs, "Thy arrows are sharp - the peoples fall under thee - (they are) in the heart of the king's enemies." All the enemies of Messiah shall one day be chastised, and fall before him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a></div><div class="verse">Thy throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <i>is</i> a right sceptre.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy throne, O God</span>. So the LXX., the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), the Chaldee paraphrase, and, among critics, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and Canon Cook. The renderings proposed by Gesenius, Ewald, and the anti-Messianic school generally are wholly untenable, as Hengstenberg has clearly shown. The psalmist's intention is to address the King, whom he has already declared to be more than man (ver. 2), as "God." <span class="cmt_word">Is for ever and ever</span>. A dominion to which there will never be any end. This is never said, and could not be truly said, of any earthly kingdom. When perpetuity is promised to the throne of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4, 36, 37</a>), it is to that throne as continued in the reign of David's Son, Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sceptre of rectitude</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness</span>, <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>, etc. God will only commit rule and authority over his Church to one who will rule justly - one who loves righteousness and hates iniquity. Messiah is alone perfect in righteousness, and <span class="accented">therefore</span> entitled to rule. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore God</span>, <span class="cmt_word">thy God</span>, <span class="cmt_word">hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows</span>. Some moderns translate, "Therefore, O God, thy God hath anointed thee," etc.; but the rendering of the Authorized Version is maintained by Dr. Kay, Professor Alexander, and our Revisers. The anointing intended is that outpouring of glory and blessedness on Messiah which followed upon his voluntary humiliation and suffering (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a></div><div class="verse">All thy garments <i>smell</i> of myrrh, and aloes, <i>and</i> cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia</span>; literally, <span class="accented">myrrh and aloes</span> [and] <span class="accented">cassia are thy garments.</span> The "and" before "cassia" appears in four manuscripts, and in all the ancient versions. The garments are so impregnated with spices as to seem made of them. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the ivory palaces</span>. "Ivory palaces" are mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a> and <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>. We must understand "palaces adorned with ivory." <span class="cmt_word">Whereby they have</span> <span class="cmt_word">made thee glad.</span> So Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and others. But most moderns render, "Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a></div><div class="verse">Kings' daughters <i>were</i> among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">King's daughters were</span> (rather, <span class="accented">are</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>among thy honourable women</span>. The marriage scene now begins to open upon us. The bridegroom has been depicted in all  his glorious majesty. The bride has now to be brought forward. She comes, accompanied by a train of attendants - "honourable women," or, noble ladies" (Kay), many of whom are "kings' daughters" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>). It must not be expected that all the details of the scene shall have exact equivalents in the spiritual marriage which it represents. <span class="cmt_word">Upon thy right hand did stand</span> (rather, <span class="accented">stands</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the</span> <span class="cmt_word">queen in gold of Ophir</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a vesture richly embroidered with gold thread (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5-8</a>). "Gold of Ophir" was known, not merely to David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>), but even to Job (<a href="../../par/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>). The "right hand" of the king was the place of honour. We find it assigned by Solomon to the queen-mother, Bathsheba (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a></div><div class="verse">Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear</span>. The psalmist, having introduced the bride to our notice in ver. 9, proceeds to address her, and to describe the glories of her person and of her <span class="accented">entourage.</span> First of all, he bids her "hearken," "consider," and "incline her ear," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reflect deeply on the new relation in which she is about to be placed, the new sphere which she is entering, the new duties which she will have to discharge. She must give herself wholly to her Lord and Spouse; she must have no thought for any one but him. <span class="cmt_word">Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.</span> She must break with all associations and bends and relationships that would separate between her and her King, forget the past in the present, cease to Judaize, and be wholly Christ's. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a></div><div class="verse">So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he <i>is</i> thy Lord; and worship thou him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty</span>.

Worship, in a certain sense, is due from every wife to every husband; but the Church's worship of Christ is worship in the absolutely highest sense (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the daughter of Tyre <i>shall be there</i> with a gift; <i>even</i> the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the daughter of Tyro shall be there with a gift</span>.

The "King's daughter "of this passage can be no other than the bride herself - the" queen" of ver. 9. As among her attendants some were "kings' daughters" (ver. 9), so she could be no less. She is "glorious," not only without, in her robe of" gold of Ophir," but also and especially within - in the inner chamber of the heart - where she is indeed "glorious," through the sanctifying presence of God's Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her clothing is of wrought</span> <span class="cmt_word">gold</span> (comp. ver. 9, and the comment <span class="accented">ad lee.</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a></div><div class="verse">She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She shall be brought unto the King in raiment</span> <span class="cmt_word">of needlework;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in garments richly embroidered.

Brides were commonly "led" into the presence of the bridegroom<span class="cmt_word">. The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee</span> (comp. ver. 9). A virgin train follows the bride as she is led to the palace of the bridegroom, for a royal bride necessarily had her attendants. These symbolize the Gentile converts that should attach themselves to the original Church, and follow that Church into Christ's presence.

A bridal train could not but be a festive one. Joy and gladness naturally characterize the procession of the nations out of darkness into God's marvellous light. They shall enter into the king's palace; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be received into the heavenly dwelling-place.
