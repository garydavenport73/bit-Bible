Irreligious men hate those who are religions, whose conduct shames them by its contrast with their own evil courses.

It was also shown, if we take "house" in a wider sense, by his careful government of the land and people, the kingdom and household of God, for forty years. <span class="cmt_word">And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> David may either mean that every reproach uttered against God was as keenly felt by him as if it had been directed against himself, or that, when men reproached him, they really meant to reproach God (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> religion) in him.

Professor Cheyne asks, "How has it been revealed to the psalmist that this is an acceptable time?"
