If Christian slaves withheld the honor and respect due to their masters, it would be as sure to bring reproach upon the Christian doctrine as if it taught insubordination and rebellion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise <i>them</i>, because they are brethren; but rather do <i>them</i> service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Let them serve them the rather</span> for <span class="accented">rather do them service</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved</span> for <span class="accented">are faithful and beloved</span>, <span class="accented">partakers of the benefit</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They that have believing masters.</span> The direction in the preceding verse applied to all slaves, though chiefly to what, as Alford says, was far the commonest ease, that of those who had unbelieving masters. But now he adds a caution with regard to the Christian slave of a Christian master. There was a danger lest the feeling that slaves and masters are brothers in Christ should unduly interfere with the respect which he owed him as his master. And so St. Paul addresses a word of special advice to such. <span class="cmt_word">Let them not despise them.</span> Let not their spiritual equality with their masters lead them to underrate the worldly difference that separates them; or to think slightly of the authority of a master relatively to his slaves (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved.</span> There is a good deal of obscurity in this sentence, but it may be observed first that the grammatical rendering of the R.V. is clearly right, and that of the A.V. clearly wrong. "They that partake of the benefit" is beyond all doubt the subject, and not the predicate. Then the construction of the two sentences (this and the preceding one) makes it certain that the subject in this sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are the same persons as the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the preceding sentence, because it is predicated of them both that they are <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and of both that they are, in convertible terms, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. And this leads us, with nearly certainty, to the further conclusion that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the <span class="accented">beneficium</span>, or "benefit," spoken of is that especial <span class="accented">service</span> - that service of love and good will running ahead of necessary duty, which the Christian slave gives to the Christian master; a sense which the very remarkable passage quoted by Alford from Seneca strikingly confirms. The only remaining difficulty, then, is the meaning "partake of" ascribed to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> But this is scarcely a difficulty. It is true that in the only two other passages in the New Testament where this verb occurs, and in its frequent use in the LXX., it has the sense of "helping" (<a href="../../par/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>); but there is nothing strange in this. The verb in the middle voice means to "lay hold of," You may <span class="accented">lay hold of</span> for the purpose of helping, supporting, clinging to, laying claim to, holding in check, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). Here the masters <span class="accented">lay hold</span> of the benefit for the purpose of enjoying it. There is possibly an indication in the word that the masters actively and willingly accept it - they stretch out their hand to take it. There does not seem to be any sense of reciprocity, as some think, in the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. The sense of the whole passage seems to be clearly, "Let not those who have believing masters think slightly of their authority because they are brethren; but let them do them extra service, beyond what they are obliged to do, for the very reason that those whom they will thus benefit are believing and beloved brethren." <span class="cmt_word">Teach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>). Observe the connection of this word with the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x391;</span> of vers. 1, 3, and elsewhere.

The R.T. has far the largest weight of authority in its favor (Ellicott). The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;</span> in Polybius means "provocation," "collision," "friction," and the like.

The difference between the A.V. "destitute" and the R.V.

The same charge is brought against the heretical teachers (<a href="../../par/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>). The cause in the A.V. and T.R., <span class="accented">from such withdraw thyself</span>, is not in the R.T.

The godly man is rich indeed. For he wants nothing in this world but what God has given him, and has acquired riches which, unlike the riches of this world, he can take away with him (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>). The enumeration of his acquired treasures follows, after a parenthetical depreciation of those of the covetous man, in ver. 11. The thought, as so often in St. Paul, is a little intricate, and its flow checked by parenthetical side-thoughts. But it seems to be as follows: "<span class="accented">But</span> godliness is, in one sense, a source of great gain, and moreover brings contentment with it - contentment, I <span class="accented">say</span>, for since we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out, we have good reason to be content with the necessaries of life, food and raiment. Indeed, those who strive for more, and pant after wealth, bring nothing but trouble upon themselves.

Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog.

It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not "the love of money," but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;</span>, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness.

But the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, to "pierce through," "transfix," applied 'especially to "spitting" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "pierced with pain" ('Il.,' 5:399).

The phrase is peculiar, and must have some special meaning. Perhaps, as Bishop Wordsworth expounds it, "the commandment" is that law of faith and duty to which Timothy vowed obedience at his baptism, and is parallel to "the good confession."

There is, at first sight, a manifest confusion of metaphors in the phrase, "laying up in store a foundation." Bishop Ellicott, following Wiesinger, understands "a wealth of good works as a foundation." Alford sees no difficulty in considering the "foundation" us a treasure. Others have conjectured <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a stored treasure," for <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

The precept to Timothy here is to keep diligent and watchful guard over the faith committed to his trust; to preserve it unaltered and uncorrupt, so as to hand it down to his successors exactly the same as he had received it.
