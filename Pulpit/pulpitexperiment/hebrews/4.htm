This verse is a renewed warning against remissness, based (as is shown by the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) on the preceding argument, but introducing also, by means of the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., a new thought, the elucidation of which is the subject of what follows. The new thought is that the true "rest of God," typified only by the rest of Canaan, remains still for the attainment of Christians. That this is the case has not yet been shown; and hence the clause, "a promise being still left." etc., does not point to a conclusion already arrived at, but to what is coming. The new thought is taken up in ver. 2, and what has been thus intimated in ver. 1 is asserted as a conclusion after proof in ver. 9. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc. A different view of the drift of the warning in this verse, main-rained very decidedly by Ebrard, demands attention. It rests on the interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which is taken to mean "should think that he has come too late," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the promise of the rest, under the idea that its meaning had been exhausted in the rest of Canaan. It may be said in support of this view that such is the most obvious meaning of the phrase; that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament most commonly means "think" or "suppose;" that the primary sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is that of being behindhand, either in place or in time; and that the perfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is thus accounted for, whereas, according to the usual interpretation, the whole phrase is unsuitable: why was not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> written, if a mere warning against remissness was intended? Further, it may be said that what immediately follows is in favor of this view of the purport of the caution in ver. 1, being an evident carrying out of its idea. Thus the verse is supposed to be not at all a continuation of the previous hortatory section, but rather serving as the thesis of the coming argumentative section, though put in the form of a caution because imperfect appreciation of the view to be now established was at the root of the danger of the Hebrew Christians. Some of them at least did not fully grasp the true character of the gospel as being the fulfill-merit of the old dispensation, the realization of its types and promises. They were inclined to rest in the Law as a revelation to which the gospel was only supplementary, and hence to regard the promised land, the offer of which was before their time, as the only rest intended; and therefore the writer, after adducing the example of the Israelites under Moses as a warning against remissness, prefaces his exposition. of the true rest of God by a warning against misapprehending it. But against this view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> suggests rather (like <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) a warning against conduct that might lead to forfeiture than a correction of an inadequate conception; and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the warning with what has gone before, in which the view of what the true rest is has not entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is most frequently used in the New Testament in its sense of "thinking," "<span class="accented">seeming</span> to one's self," yet it has there, as in Greek generally, the sense also of "appearing," "seeming to others;" and certainly, as far as the word itself is concerned, may have this sense here. <span class="accented">Also</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, though its primary idea (as of <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is that of "coming after," is nevertheless invariably used in the New Testament to express "deficiency," or "falling short" (cf. especially in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>): it is never elsewhere (though capable of the meaning) used to express lateness in time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">seem</span> to have fallen short" (rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) is capable of being accounted for. One explanation of it, adopted by Alford, is indeed hardly tenable. He accounts for the past tense by supposing reference to the final judgment; taking it to mean, "<span class="accented">lest</span> any one of you should then appear [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> be found] to have fallen short." But the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however used, refers, not to what is made evident, but to what is thought or seems, refuses to be thus misinterpreted. It is better to take it as a softening expression. We may suppose that the writer (with a delicacy that reminds us of St. Paul) was unwilling to imply his own expectation of any failure; and so he only bids his readers beware of so living as even to present the appearance of it or suggest the thought of it to others. According to this view, the tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is intelligible, the supposed deficiency spoken of being previous to its being perceived or suspected. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to supply an understood genitive, such as "the promise," or "the rest," after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It <span class="accented">may</span> be used (as elsewhere) absolutely, to express deficiency or failure; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the conditions required for attainment. One view of its meaning is that it has reference to the idea of being behindhand in a race: but there is nothing in the context to suggest this figure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is not necessary that ver. 1 should express <span class="accented">only</span> the idea of the following argument; it does sufficiently express it in the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; and it is in the style of this Epistle to connect new trains of argument by a continuous chain of thought with what has gone before (cf. the beginning of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>. and 3.). Though there is uncertainty as to the sequence of thought in the several clauses of the following argument (vers. 2-11), its general drift is clear. Its leading ideas are these: The invitation to enter God's rest contained in the psalm shows that the rest of Canaan, which, though forfeited under Moses, had long been actually attained under Joshua, was not the final rest intended. What, then, is meant by this remarkable term, "my rest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's own rest? Our thoughts go back to the beginning of the Bible, where a rest of God himself is spoken of; where he is said to have rested on the seventh day from all his works. Participation, then, in that heavenly rest - a true sabbath rest with God - is what the term implies. Though this rest began "from the foundation of the world," man's destined share in if, however long delayed, was intimated by the typical history of the Israelites under Moses, and by the warning and renewed invitation of the psalm. This renewed invitation makes it plain that it is still attainable by God's people. It has at last been made attainable by Christ. who, as our great High Priest, has himself entered it, and leads us into it if we are but faithful.

The meaning and purpose of the first part of this verse is plain, as is also the general intention of the second; viz. to account parenthetically for the gospel to the Israelites under Moses having failed of its purpose, and at the same time to renew the warning of their example with respect to the gospel now preached to Christians. But the passage is still one of singular difficulty, on account both of the various readings of it, and of the peculiarity of the language used whatever reading be adopted. With respect to the various readings, the main and indeed only important question is between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">agreeing</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>.

Then the readings <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> rest on such slight authority, and are so likely to have been substitutions (the latter to make the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> intelligible), that they need not be considered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The reading of the Textus Receptus, following the Vulgate, is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>the great preponderance of ancient authority (including that of all the uncial manuscripts except <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>) supports <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> The latter, then, must be accepted as the true reading, if authority alone is to be our guide. But then comes the difficulty of making any sense of it. The only way of doing so is to understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("those who heard") in the sense of "those who hearkened;" the sense of the passage being "The word of hearing did not profit them, because they were not united by faith with those who not only heard, but hearkened and obeyed." Most of the Fathers, reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> to refer in this sense to Caleb and Joshua. But, if what has been said above be true as to these exceptions to the general unbelief not having been in the writer's mind, such an allusion is highly improbable. Some (Alford, e.g.) take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> with no historical reference, but as denoting hearkeners generally. Alford, however, though adopting this as the best solution of an acknowledged difficulty, confesses himself not satisfied with it, as well he may. A very serious objection to either view, even apart from the strangeness of the whole expression if such be its meaning, is that, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is certainly used elsewhere in the sense thus assigned to it, the whole context here suggests different one. Cf. <span class="accented">supra</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: and especially <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately preceding. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting hearing only, seems to have suggested the use of the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to which it would therefore be most unnatural to assign a different meaning. If, then, all devices for making sense of the best supported text prove unsatisfactory, and if the Textus Receptus gives an intelligible meaning, we might surely be justified in adopting the latter, however ill supported. Internal evidence (though great caution should be used in our estimate of it) need not yield entirely to external, nor common sense to authority, in the determination of true readings. But in this case the argument from internal probability has now been strengthened by the discovery of the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Sinaitic Codex (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>). This, then, being adopted, though the expression be peculiar, the meaning is no longer obscure, whether we take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It may be either that "the word of hearing did not profit them because it was not mingled with their faith to those that heard;" or "because it was not mingled by faith with those that heard it." In the latter case the idea is that of the necessity of the spoken word entering the heart, and being (so to speak) assimilated by the hearers through the instrumentality of faith, in order to profit them.

This seems to be a concise enunciation of the proof, unfolded in the verses that follow, of the true rest being one into which Christians have still an entrance. The idea is that, though God's own rest had been from the beginning, and man had not yet entered it, yet the possibility of his doing so had not ceased to be intimated: it had continued open potentially to man.

There are two ways of understanding this verse. Its general intention is, indeed, clear. It accounts for the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> which precedes, expressing that the true meaning of "God's rest" is not satisfied by any earthly rest, but only by one like his. The question is whether the verse is to be taken as a general proposition or as referring specifically to Christ. In favor of the latter view is the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">literal</span> translation would be "He that entered...  himself also <span class="accented">rested."</span> Ebrard, on this ground, strenuously defends the reference to Christ; and also on the ground of parallelism with <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first division of the general argument. In the first division (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>.) the course of thought was - Dominion over creation has been assigned to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man fulfils his destiny. In this second division the corresponding course of drought is - God's rest has been offered to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man may enter it. And thus (as has been explained above) the conclusion that Jesus is the High Priest of humanity is led up to by two parallel lines of argument. But the third of the propositions of the second line of argument (corresponding to <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first) is not distinctly expressed unless it be in the verse before us; and therefore this verse, on this ground as well as that of the use of the aorist, is taken to refer to Christ. On the other hand, it is argued (Bleek, Do Wette, Delitzsch, etc.) that, if a specific reference to Christ had been intended, he would have been mentioned, so as to make the meaning clear; and secondly, that the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is legitimate, though the proposition be a general one. Delitzsch explains it thus: "The author might have written <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or (more classically) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but he has taken up into the main proposition the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which properly belongs (according to <a href="../../par/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>) to the clause of comparison: whosoever has entered God's rest, of him the '<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> holds good in the same manner as of God." And, further, it is to be observed that the Greek aorist may sometimes be put for the present, "to express an action completely determined, every doubt as to its truth and unalterableness being removed" (Matthiae, 'Gr. Gram.,' &sect; 506). In this instance the idea might be - he that has entered into God's rest rested, when he so entered, from all his works, etc. On the whole, it appears that specific reference to Christ is <span class="accented">not</span> apparent from the immediate context, or required by the mere language used. Still, in consideration of the general argument, we may take the writer to have meant his readers to understand that it was Christ who <span class="accented">had</span> so entered the rest of God, so as to lead God's people into it. That this is so appears from ver. 14,  <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x37e;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to require that preceding link of thought. - Among man's deepest feelings is a longing for rest. Haply in the freshness and ardor of early life not deeply felt, it recurs from time to time, and grows stronger with advancing years. Nothing in life fully satisfies this longing. Labors, distresses, disappointments, anxieties, never allow the desired repose. Few there are whose hearts have not sometimes echoed the psalmist's words, "Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then would I flee away, and be at rest!" Many since Job have felt something of his longing to be where "the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." Is there to be no satisfaction ever of this deep human craving? Holy Scripture meets it as it meets all others. It spoke of a rest of God above creation from the beginning of time; it intimated man's part and interest in it by the weekly sabbath which he was to keep with God. But this was, after all, but a symbol and earnest of something unattained. At length a fuller realization of the longed-for rest was held out to the chosen people, and the Promised Land was pictured beforehand in the colors of an earthly Paradise. Forfeited, when first offered, through the people's unworthiness (representing by an historical parable the bar to man's entrance into the eternal rest), it was attained at last. But the true rest still came not. Canaan, like the sabbath, proved but a symbol of something unattained. Yet the old longing for rest went on, and inspired men went on proclaiming it as attainable and still to come. The irrepressible craving, the suggestive symbols, the prophetic anticipations, are all fulfilled in Christ. He, when he had passed with us through this earthly scene of labor, entered, with our nature, into that eternal rest of God, to prepare a place for us, having by his atonement removed the bar to human entrance. Through our faith in him we are assured that our deep-seated craving for satisfaction unattained as yet, which we express by the term "<span class="accented">rest</span>," is a true inward prophecy, and that, though we find it not <span class="accented">here</span>, we may through him, if we are faithful, confidently expect it <span class="accented">there</span>, where "<span class="accented">beyond</span> these voices there is peace." There now follows (vers. 11-14) a renewal of the warning of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>, urged now with increased force in view of the danger of slighting such a revelation as the gospel has been shown to be; after which (ver. 14, etc.) come words of encouragement, based on the view, now a second time arrived at, of Christ being our great High Priest. And thus the exposition of his priesthood, which follows in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, is led up to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-11.htm">Hebrews 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us therefore do our diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, so translated in A.V. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9, 21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to enter into that rest, lest any one fall after the same example of disobedience</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which means "unbelief"). It is a question, though not at all affecting the general sense of the passage, whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> should not he translated "fall <span class="accented">into</span> the same example." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> has undoubtedly the sense of "to fall into," and is frequently so used in the LXX., and the subordinate position of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> in the sentence - between <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - is against its being used absolutely as the emphatic word. If so, the meaning will be "fall into the same <span class="accented">exemplar</span> of disobedience," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the kind of disobedience of which that of the Israelites was a sample. This interpretation of the phrase, being that of the Vulgate, is supported by Alford, Davison, Lunemann; though most modern commentators (Bengel, Bleek, De Wette, Tholuck, Delitzsch, Wordsworth), with Chrysostom, take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> absolutely, as in <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a> (<span class="accented">ruat</span>, Bengel), and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as meaning, "so as to present the same (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> a like) example of disobedience," the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Delitzsch, being the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> of state or condition. The warning is next enforced by a vivid representation of the penetrating and resistless power of the "Word of God." The question arises whether "the Word of God" is here to be understood in St. John's sense of the <span class="accented">Hypostatic Word, i.e.</span> the Second Person of the holy Trinity, who became incarnate in Christ. It is so understood by the Fathers generally; and the fact of this Epistle being tinged generally with the thought and terminology of Philo (whose use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, derived from the Platonic philosophy in combination with Jewish theology, seems to anticipate in some degree, however vaguely, the doctrine of St. John) gives some countenance to the view. But against it are the following considerations: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Christ is not elsewhere in this Epistle designated as "the Word" but as "the SON." His eternal relation to the Father, though otherwise plainly intimated, is not expressed by this term, as it was by St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The description of the Word, <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">sharper</span> than any two-edged sword," is not suitable to the Hypostatic Word himself, but rather to the utterance of his power. Thus in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "<span class="accented">the</span> Son of <span class="accented">man</span>," and in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, "<span class="accented">he</span> whose name is called the Word of <span class="accented">God</span>," has a "<span class="accented">sharp</span> two-edged sword proceeding out of his mouth." The sword is not himself, but that which "came forth out of his mouth." Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked;" cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, "The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Hence, notwithstanding the prevailing view of the Fathers, it seems best to understand the term here as meaning generally the Divine utterance, without definite reference to the Hypo-static Word. It was the Word of God, in this sense, that debarred the ancient Israelites from their rest, and doomed them in the wilderness; it is the same Word which still more, as being uttered in the Son, is so searching and resistless now. True, it is through the Hypostatic Word that the Godhead has ever operated, of old as well as now, being God's eternal utterance of himself: the only question is whether this truth is here intended to be expressed, or, in other words, whether <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has here the personal sense in which St. John uses the term. It is possible that the writer passes in thought to a personal sense in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of ver. 13, where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> preceding, rather than to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But certainly at the beginning of the passage this specific sense does not seem to be suggested either by the context or the language used. Ver. 12. - For living is the Word of God, and powerful (or, <span class="accented">effectual</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="../../par/philemon/1-6.htm">Philemon 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>), and sharper than any two- edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Observe how the predicates form a climax. The Word of God is, first, <span class="accented">living</span>, instinct with the life of the living God who utters it, itself a living power (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>); then, not only so, but also <span class="accented">operative, effective</span> of its purpose; then, in this its operation, more keenly <span class="accented">cutting</span> than any sword; cutting so as to <span class="accented">perpetrate</span> through and through - through the whole inner being of man to its inmost depths; then, in doing so, <span class="accented">discerning</span> and opening to judgment all the secrets of his consciousness. This description of the power of the Word of God is given as a reason fur the warning, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> etc., "Let us give diligence," etc.; <span class="accented">for</span>, if we slight the Word of God, we can have no escape from its irresistible operation; we shall be thoroughly exposed and inevitably judged. The view of the Word of God having a sharply <span class="accented">cutting</span> operation is found in Philo, from whom Bleek cites a series of passages cognate to this in the Epistle. Cf. especially one in the treatise, 'Quis Rerum Divinorum Haeres.:' <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>    <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>, etc. And for the comparison to a sword, cf. (as above referred to) <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; and <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>. The true reading of the part of the sentence, "of soul and spirit," etc., is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus after <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> being ill supported. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, after <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, is therefore most naturally taken, and so as to give the best sense, in the sense of "both," not "and;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the second clause is not to be taken as denoting a further dividing - of the bodily parts as well as of the soul and spirit, but as expressing, by recurrence to the figure of a sword, the thoroughness of the division of soul and spirit. Further, the division spoken of is surely not of the soul <span class="accented">from</span> the spirit, as some have taken it. Delitzsch, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, explains to this effect - that in fallen man his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which proceeded from God and carries in itself the Divine image, has become, "as it were, extinguished;" that "through the operation of grace man recalls to mind his own true nature, though shattered by sin;" "that heavenly nature or' man reappears when Christ is formed in him;" and thus the Word of God "marks out and separates" the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in him from the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> in which it had been, "<span class="accented">as</span> it were, <span class="accented">extinguished."</span> Then, taking the clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, to express a further process of dissection, he explains by saying that the Word of God "exhibits to man the fact that ungodly powers are working also in his <span class="accented">bodily</span> frame, which has now in every joint and chord and marrow become the seat of sin and death, and so "<span class="accented">goes</span> on to scrutinize" his bodily as well as his spiritual part," and "lays bare before the eyes of God and before his own the whole man thus described." But the idea of the separation, in the above sense, of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, even if tenable, is certainly far-fetched, and that of the corporeal dissection supposed is hardly intelligible. Further, the "dividing" of the bodily parts spoken of in the text (whether an illustration or a further process) does not suggest the separation of one part from another, since a sword does not divide the joints or the limbs (whichever be meant by <span class="accented">apathy</span>) <span class="accented">from</span> the marrow, though it may penetrate both. We may explain thus: It is well known that St. Paul divides man's complex nature into body, soul, and spirit - <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). His bodily organization (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is not apparently here under consideration, except in regard to the figure of the sword; the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> is his animal life or soul, the seat (so to speak) of his sensations, and of his natural affections and desires; his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the more Divine part of his nature, in virtue of which he has a conscience, aspires after holiness, apprehends spiritual mysteries, holds communion with God, and is influenced by the Divine Spirit. The idea, then, is that, as a very keen sword not only cuts through the joints dividing bone from bone, but also through the bones themselves into the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates and discloses not,, . only. the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> too, "piercing through soul and spirit, <span class="accented">yea</span> [with reference to the illustration used] through both joints [or, 'limbs'] and marrow." Ebrard, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "limbs" (a sense in which the word is used, though that of "joints" is its proper and more usual one), regards these and the "marrow" as corresponding respectively to the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>: the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> being understood as "something lying deep in man, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> lying still deeper." Thus as a very trenchant sword cuts through, not only the limbs, but also the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates, not only that part of human consciousness which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, but also that deeper and more inward part which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But the general sense of the passage is plain enough without our supposing this strict analogy to have been intended. Expositors, in their analysis of the meaning of passages, may often detect more than the author thought cf. On <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "a discerner of"), cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24, 25</a>, where the effects of the Word of God, brought to bear through the gift of prophecy on one without the gift entering into a congregation of prophesying Christians, are thus described: "<span class="accented">he</span> is convinced of all, he is judged [rather, 'examined,' 'scrutinized,' <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] of all; the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you [or, 'among you'] of a truth." So searching and judicial is the power of the Word of God, that it reaches and discloses the inmost depths of a man's consciousness - discloses them to himself, and, though he should resist, leaves him without escape, exposed and judged.

The main difficulty in this verse is as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "<span class="accented">laid</span> open"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament or LXX., but is, with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, not uncommon in Philo and Josephus) has in classical Greek the sense of "seizing by the throat," or "bending back the neck," as in wrestling. And this, with the further idea of "overthrowing" or "laying prostrate," is the prevailing sense in Philo, from whom Wetstein quotes many passages in illustration. Taking, then, with most modern commentators, the sense of bending back the neck as the primary one, we have only to consider what secondary meaning is here to be attached to it. Some take the idea to be that of being thrown on the ground supine, so as to be thoroughly exposed to view. So Bengel: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">resupino</span>, Graece et Latine dicitur pro patefacio. Corpora quae prona jacent vix nuda censentur; nam se ipsa tegunt: <span class="accented">resupinata</span>, secundum partes nobilissimas quasque et distinctissimas visui patent." Many (Eisner, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kuinoel, Bretschneider, Block, De Wette, etc., following Perizonius, on AElian, 'Vat. Hist.,' 12:58) see an allusion to the Roman custom of exposing criminals "<span class="accented">reducto</span> capite," "<span class="accented">retortis cervieibus</span>," so that all might see their faces (see Suetonius, <span class="accented">Vitel.,'</span> 17; Pliny, 'Panegyr.,' 34. 3). There is, however, no other known instance of the Greek verb being used with this reference, which there seems to be no necessity for assuming. The idea may be simply the general one thus expressed by Delitzsch, "that whatever shamefaced creature bows its head, and would fain withdraw and cloak itself from the eyes of God, has indeed the throat, as it were, bent back before those eyes, with no possibility of escape, exposed and naked to their view." Many of the ancients (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Ecumenius, Theophylact) saw in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> a reference to the treatment of sacrificial victims, as being smitten on the neck or hung by the neck for the purpose of being flayed from the neck downwards, or cut open thence, so as to expose the entrails to view. But no instance is known of such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, the idea of which may have been suggested to commentators by the figure of the sword in the verse preceding; which figure, however, there is no reason to suppose continued in ver. 13, the idea of which is simply complete exposure, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>. The ancients take the concluding expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> whom our account must be given," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">to</span> whom we are responsible as our judge" - in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The A.V. seems better to give the general idea of relation by the apt phrase, "<span class="accented">with</span> whom we have to do." Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> here has no reference to the Word of God, the recurrence of the word, in a subordinate sense, being merely accidental. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - To the interposed minatory warning of the three preceding verses now succeeds encouragement, based on the view, which has been now a second time led up to, of Christ being our great High Priest, who can both sympathize and succor. The passage answers closely in thought to the conclusion of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, and might naturally have followed there; but that, before taking up the subject of Christ's priesthood, the writer had another line of thought to pursue, leading up (as has been explained) to the same conclusion. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning of ver. 14 either connects <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("let us hold fast") with the <span class="accented">verses</span> immediately preceding in the sense, "The Word of God being so searching and resistless, let us <span class="accented">therefore</span> hold fast," etc., - in which ease the participial clause <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., is a confirmation of this exhortation (so Delitzsch); or is connected logically with the participial clause as a resumption of the whole preceding argument. Certainly the idea of the participial clause is the prominent one in the writer's mind, what follows being an expansion of it. And the position of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> suggests this connection. It is to be observed that, after the manner of the Epistle, this concluding exhortation serves also as a transition to the subject of the following chapters, and anticipates in some degree what is to be set forth, though all the expressions used have some ground in what has gone before. <span class="cmt_word">Having then a great High Priest who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</span> The rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> in the A.V. ("is passed <span class="accented">into</span> the heavens") is evidently wrong. The idea is that Christ has passed <span class="accented">through</span> the intermediate heavens to the immediate presence of God - to the sphere of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>.

Clemens Alexandrinus, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> speaks of seven: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Cf. also "the heaven and the heaven of heavens" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>), and "who hast set thy glory above the heavens" (<a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>), also "the third heaven," into which St. Paul was rapt (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. The conception of the phrase is that, whatever spheres of created heavens intervene between our earth and the eternal uncreated, beyond them to it Christ has gone, - into "heaven itself (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>);" "before the <span class="accented">face</span> of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). From this expression, together with <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a> (above quoted), is rightly deduced the doctrine of Christ s ubiquity even in his human nature. For, carrying that nature with him and still retaining it, he is spoken of as having passed to the region which admits no idea of limitation, and so as to "fill all things." The obvious bearing of this doctrine on that of the presence in the Eucharist may be noted in passing. (It is to be observed that "the heavens" in the plural is used (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>) of the seat of the Divine majesty itself to which Christ has gone. It is the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that determines the meaning here.) The designation, "Jesus the Son of God," draws attention first to the man Jesus who was known by that name in the flesh, and secondly to the "more excellent name," above expatiated on, in virtue of which he "hath passed through the heavens." The conclusion follows that it is the human Jesus, with his humanity, who, being also the Son of God, has so "passed through." There may <span class="accented">possibly</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> some think) be an intention of contrasting him with Joshua (<span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 8), who won the entrance into the typical rest. But it is not necessary to suppose this; vers. 8 and 14 are at too great a distance from each other to suggest a connection of thought between them; and besides  <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> occurred similarly at the end of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, before any mention of Joshua. The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> distinguishes Christ from all other high priests (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The high priest of the Law passed through the veil to the earthly symbol of the eternal glory; the "great High Priest" has passed through the heavens to the eternal glory itself. As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. on Hebrews 3:1. In consideration of having such a High Priest, who, as is expressed in what follows, can both sympathize and succor, the readers are exhorted to "hold fast," not only their inward faith, but their "confession" of it before men. A besetting danger of the Hebrew Christians was that of shrinking from a full and open confession under the influence of gainsaying or persecution. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all things tempted like as we are, without sin</span>.

His temptation was after the likeness of ours, "apart from sin," or "sin except." For similar expressions, though not with definite reference to temptation, cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. But how is the exception of sin to be understood? Is it that, though, like us, tempted, he, unlike us, resisted temptation?

Now, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means sometimes "to tempt to sin," as Satan or our own lusts tempt us (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>, etc.); and also "to prove.... to try," "to test faithfulness," as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, etc., in which sense, with reference especially to afflictive trials, the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is commonly used (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). That Christ was not only subjected to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in this latter sense, but was also directly assailed by the tempter to sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), appears from the Gospel record. But here comes in a difficulty. There can, we conceive, be no real temptation where there is no liability to the sin suggested by temptation, still less where there is no possibility of sinning. But can we imagine any such liability, or even possibility, in the case of the Divine and Sinless One? If not, wherein did the temptation consist? How could it be at all like ours, or one through his own experience of which he can sympathize with us? It was for maintaining, on the strength of such considerations, the theoretic peccability of Christ, that Irving was expelled as heretical flora the Presbyterian communion. The question has undoubtedly its serious difficulties in common with the whole subjeer of the Divine and human in Christ. The following thoughts may, however, aid solution. That Christ, in his human nature, partook of all the original affections of humanity - hope, fear, desire, joy, grief, indignation, shrinking from suffering, and the like - is apparent, not only from his life, but also from the fact that his assumption of our humanity would have otherwise been incomplete. Such affections are not in themselves sinful; they only are so when, under temptation, any of them become inordinate, and serve as motives to transgression of duty. He, in virtue of his Divine personality, could not through them be seduced into sin; but it does not follow that he could not, in his human nature, feel their power to seduce, or rather the power of the tempter to seduce through them, and thus have personal experience of man's temptation. St. John says of one" born of God" that he "doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <span class="accented">cannot</span> sin, because he is born of God" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>). He does not mean that the regenerate Christian is not exposed to and does not feel, the power of temptation; only that, so far forth as he lives in the new life from God, he is proof against it; he gives no internal assent to the seduction of the tempter; and so "that wicked one toucheth him net" (ver. 18). What is thus said of one "born of God" may be said much more, and without any qualification, of the Son of God, without denying that he too experienced the power of temptation, though altogether proof against it. Bengel says, "Quomodo autem, <span class="accented">sine pectate</span> tentatus, compati potest tentatis <span class="accented">cum peceato?</span> In intellectu multo acrius anima salvatoris percepit imagines tentantes quam nos infirmi: in voluntato tam celeriter incursum earum retudit quam ignis aquae guttulam sibi objectam. Expertus est igitur qua virtute sit opus ad tentationes vincendas. Compati potest nam et sine peccato, et tamen vere est tentatus."
