If, therefore, the assertion now made to his wives was not an unblushing falsehood, Jacob could not have been the monster of craft and deception depicted by some (Kalisch); while, if it was, it must have required considerable effrontery to appeal to his wives' knowledge for a confirmation of what they knew to be a deliberate untruth. The hypothesis that Jacob first acquired his great wealth by "consummate cunning," and then piously "abused the authority of God in covering or justifying them" (Kalisch), presupposes on the part of Jacob a degree of wickedness inconceivable in one who had enjoyed the sublime theophany of Bethel.

Since all the parti-colored animals had already been removed (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>), this vision must have been intended to assure him that the flocks would produce speckled and spotted progeny all the same as if the ringstraked and grisled rams and he-goats had not been removed from their midst (cf. Kurtz, &sect; 78). To insist upon a contradiction between this account of the increase of Jacob's flocks and that mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a> is to forget that both may be true. Equally arbitrary does it seem to be to accuse Jacob of fraud in adopting the artifice of the pilled rods (Kalisch). Without resorting to the supposition that he acted under God s guidance (Wordsworth), we may believe that the dream suggested the expedient referred to, in which some see Jacob's unbelief and impatience (Kurtz, Gosman in Lange), and others a praiseworthy instance of self-help (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee</span>. If the preceding clause appears to imply that the vision was sent to Jacob at the beginning of the six years' service, the present clause scents to point to the end of that period as the date of its occurrence; in which case it would require to be understood as a Divine intimation to Jacob that his immense wealth was not to be ascribed to the success of his own stratagem, but to the blessing of God (Delitzsch). The difficulty of harmonizing the two views has led to the suggestion that Jacob here mixes the accounts of two different visions accorded to him, at the commencement and at the close of the period of servitude (Nachmanides, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kurtz,- ' Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish).

Whether Jacob's absence from the festivities is to be explained by the dissension existing between him and Laban, which either caused him to be uninvited or led him to decline the invitation (Kurtz), or by the supposition that he had first gone and subsequently left the banquet (Lange), the fact that Laban was so engaged afforded Jacob the opportunity he desired for making his escape. <span class="cmt_word">And Rachel had stolen</span> (or, "<span class="accented">and</span> Rachel <span class="accented">stole</span>," availing herself likewise of the opportunity presented by her father's absence) <span class="cmt_word">the images that were her father's.</span> The teraphim, from an unused root, <span class="accented">taraph</span>, signifying to live comfortably, like the Sanscrit <span class="accented">trip</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Arabic tarafa (Gesenius, Furst, <span class="accented">sub voces</span>), appear to have been small human figures (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>), though the image in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a> must have been nearly life-size, or at least a full-sized bust, sometimes made of silver (<a href="../../par/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>), though commonly constructed of wood (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13-16</a>); they were worshipped as gods (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">vide</span>, Vulgate, cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>), consulted for oracles (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), and believed to be the custodians and promoters of human happiness (<a href="../../par/judges/18-24.htm">Judges 18:24</a>). Probably derived from the Aramaeans (Furst, Kurtz), or the Chaldeans (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, Kalisch, Wordsworth), the worship of teraphim was subsequently denounced as idolatrous (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-24.htm">2 Kings 13:24</a>).

Rachel's motive for abstracting her father's teraphim has been variously ascribed to a desire to prevent her father from discovering, by inquiring at his gods, the direction of their flight (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller), to protect herself, in case, of being overtaken, by an appeal to her father s gods (Josephus), to draw her father from the practice of idolatry (Bazil, Gregory, Nazisnzen, Theodoret), to obtain children for herself through their assistance (Lengerke, Gerlach), to preserve a memorial of her ancestors, whose pictures these teraphim were (Lightfoot); but was probably due to avarice, if the images were made of precious metals (Pererius), or to a taint of superstition which still adhered to her otherwise religious nature (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary ), causing her to look to these idols for protection (Kalisch, Murphy) or consultation (Wordsworth) on her journey.

Another instance of this play upon the sound and sense is to be found in vers. 19, 20 - "Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's; and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Syrian" (cf.

The alternation of heat and cold in many eastern countries is very great and severely felt by shepherds, travelers, and watchmen, who require to pass the night in the open air, and who in consequence are often obliged to wear clothes lined with skins (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>). "The thermometer at 24&deg; Fahr. at night, a lump of solid ice in our basins in the morning, and then the scorching heat of the day drawing up the moisture, made the neighborhood, convenient as it was, rather a fever-trap, and premonitory symptoms warned us to move" (Tristram, 'The Land of Moab,' p. 217). "The night air at Joaiza was keen and cold; indeed there was a sharp frost, and ice appeared on all the little pools about the camp" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 364). "Does a master reprove his servant for being idle; he will ask, "What can I do? the heat eats me up by day, and the cold eats me up by night'" (Roberts 'Oriental Illustrations,' p. 37; cf.

Dr. Kennicott, regarding the twenty years of ver. 38 as having intervened between the fourteen and the six of ver. 41, makes the entire period of Jacob's sojourn in Padan-aram to have been forty years. In support of this he contends - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, twice repeated (in ver. 38 and in ver. 41), may be legitimately rendered, "This (one) twenty years I was with thee" (ver. 38), i.e. taking care of thy flocks; and "this for myself (another) twenty years in thy house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. serving for thy daughters and thy cattle (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/14-20.htm">Exodus 14:20</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that on this hypothesis more time is afforded for the birth of Jacob's family, viz. twenty-seven years instead of seven; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it relieves the narrative of certain grave chronological difficulties in connection with Judah and his family, which, on the supposition of the shorter period, subsequently emerge, such as that Judah and his sons must have been quite children when they married (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1-11</a>). But, on the other hand, in favor of the accepted chronology it may be urged - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the interposition of a second twenty years in the middle of the first is unnatural; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, though legitimate, the proposed rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> does not at first sight suggest itself as that which Jacob intended; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it is not impossible for Jacob's family to have been born in the short space of seven years (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that in reality the difficulties connected with Judah and his sons are not removed by the hypothesis of a forty years' sojourn in Padan-aram any more than by a sojourn of only twenty years, since Judah must have married either after the sale of Joseph, in which case only twenty-two years remain for the birth and marriage of Er and Onan, for Pharez and Zarah, Judah's children by Tamar, to grow to manhood, and for Pharez to have two sons, Hezron and Hamul, before descending to Egypt, unless indeed, as Kurtz supposes, Judah's grandchildren were born in Egypt; or before the sale of Joseph - indeed, if Hezron and Hamul were born in Canaan, before the birth of Joseph, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. while Judah was yet in Padan-aram, which is contrary to the narrative (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1, 2</a>). For these reasons, though adopted by some excellent authorities (Bishop Horsley, Adam Clarke, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), the computation of Dr. Kennicott does not appear of sufficient weight to set aside the ordinary reckoning, which is followed by interpreters of equal credit (Keil, Kalisch, Kurtz, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast changed my wages ten times</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, if not, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unless, introducing the protasis of the sentence) t<span class="cmt_word">he God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the object of Isaac's fear, not "terror" (Oort and Kuenen, <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 243), viz.

"It is scarcely possible to doubt," says Kalisch, "that an important historical fact," relating to the primitive language of the patriarchs, "is concealed in this part of the narrative;" but whether that fact was that Aramaic, Syriac, or Chaldee was the mother-tongue of the family of Nahor, while Hebrew was acquired by Abraham in Canaan (Block, Delitzsch, Keil), or that Laban had deviated from the original speech of his ancestors (Jerome, Augustine), or that' Laban and Jacob both used the same language with some growing dialectic differences (Gosman in Lange, Inglis), Laban simply on this occasion giving the heap a name which would be known to the inhabitants of the district (Wordsworth), seems impossible to determine with certainty. The most that ran be reasonably inferred from the term <span class="accented">Jegar-sahadutha</span> is that Aramaic was the language of Mesopotamia (Rosenm&uuml;ller); besides this expression there is no other e<span class="accented">vide</span>nce that Laban and Jacob conversed in different dialects; while it is certain that the word Mizpah, which was probably also spoken by Laban, is not Chaldee or Aramaic but Hebrew.

Ewald supposes that the mound (Galeed) and the watch tower (Mispah) were different objects, and that the meaning of the (so-called) legend is that, while the former (the mountain) was riled up by Jacob and his people, the latter (now the city and fortress of Mizpah on one of the heights of Gilead) was constructed by Laban and his followers (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'History of Israel,' vol. 1. p. 347); but the "<span class="accented">grotesqusnesa"</span> of this interpretation of the Hebrew story is its best refutation - <span class="cmt_word">for he</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

The emphatic word closes the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge</span> - the verb is plural, either because Laban regarded the Elohim of Nahor as different from the Elohim of Abraham (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or because, though acknowledging only one Elohim, he viewed him as maintaining several and distinct relations to the persons named (cf.
