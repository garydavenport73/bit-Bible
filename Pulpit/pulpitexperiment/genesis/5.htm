It is too frequently taken for granted that the people who could build cities, invent musical instruments, and make songs were unacquainted with the art of writing; and though certainly we cannot affirm that the transmission of such a family register as is here recorded was beyond the capabilities of oral tradition, it is obvious that its preservation would be much more readily secured by some kind of documentary notation. <span class="cmt_word">Of the generations</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> evolutions (<span class="accented">tol'doth</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of Adam</span>.

"A supernatural remedy does not prevent generation from participating in the corruption of sin. Therefore, according to the flesh Seth was born a sinner, though he was afterwards renewed by the Spirit of grace" (Calvin). The doctrine of inherited depravity or transmitted sin has been commonly held to favor the theory which accounts for the origin of the human soul <span class="accented">per traducem</span> (Tertullian, Luther, Delitzsch), in opposition to that which holds it to be due to the creative power of God (Jerome, Augustine, Calvin, Beza, Turretin). Kalisch thinks the statement "Adam begat Seth in his own image ' decisive in favor of Traducianism, while Hodge affirms "it only asserts that Seth was like his father, and sheds no light, on the mysterious process of generation ('Syst.

The expression is not appended to the genealogical list of the Fathers after the Flood, doubtless as being then sufficiently understood; and it is not said of the descendants of Cain that they died, "as if the inheritance of the sons of God were not here on earth, but in death, as the days of the deaths of martyrs are held in honor by the Church as their birthdays" (Wordsworth).

The phrase, used also of Noah, (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), and by Micah (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>. Cf. the similar expressions, "to walk before God," <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a>, and "to walk after God," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-4.htm">Deuteronomy 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>), portrays a life of singularly elevated piety; not merely a constant realization of the Divine presence, or even a perpetual effort at holy obedience, but also "a maintenance of the most confidential intercourse with the personal God (Keil). It implies a situation of nearness to God, if not in place at least in spirit; a character of likeness to God (<a href="../../par/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>), and a life of converse with God. Following the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f72;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x1f7c;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>), the writer to the Hebrews describes it as a life that was "pleasing to God," as springing from the root of faith (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>). Yet though pre-eminently spiritual and contemplative, Jude tells us (vers. 14, 15) the patriarch s life had its active and aggressive outlook towards the evil times in which he lived. <span class="cmt_word">After he begat Methuselah</span>. "Which intimates that he did not begin to be eminent for piety till about that time; at first he walked as other men' (Henry). Procopius Gazeus goes beyond this, and thinks that before his son's birth Enoch was "a wicked liver," but then repented. The historian's language, however, does not necessarily imply that his piety was so late in commencing and it is more pleasing to think that from his youth upwards he was "as a shining star for virtue and holiness (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">Three hundred years.</span> As his piety began early, <span class="accented">so</span> likewise did it continue long; it was not intermittent and fluctuating, but steadfast and persevering (cf. <a href="../../par/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And begat sons and daughters.</span> "Hence it is undeniably evident that the stats and use of matrimony doth very well agree with the severest course of holiness, and with the office of a prophet or preacher" (Peele). <span class="cmt_word">And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.</span> "A year of years" (Henry); "the same period as that of the revolution of the earth round the sun. After he had finished his course, revolving round him who is the true light, which is God, in the orbit of duty, he was approved by God, and taken to him" (Wordsworth).  Modern critics have discovered in the age of Enoch traces of a mythical origin.  They conclude the entire list of names to be not older than the time of the Babylonian Nabonassar, and believe it to be not improbable that "the Babylonians regulated the calendar with the assistance of an Indian astrologer or <span class="accented">ganaka</span> (arithmetician) of the town of <span class="accented">Chanoge"</span> (Von Bohlen). But "it would be strange indeed if just in the life of Enoch, which represents the purest and sublimest unity with God, a heathen and astrological element were intentionally introduced;" and, besides, "it is almost generally admitted that our list contains no astronomical numbers that the years which it specifies refer to the lives of individuals, not to periods of the world; and that none of all these figures is in any way reducible "to a chronological, system" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And Enoch walked with God</span>. "<span class="accented">Non otiosa</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>," but an emphatic repetition, indicative of the ground of what follows. <span class="cmt_word">And he was not</span>.

"Not absolutely he was not, but relatively he was not extant in the sphere of sense." "<span class="accented">Non</span> amplius inter mortales apparuit" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). "If this phrase does not denote annihilation, much less does the phrase "and he died." The one denotes absence from the world of sense, and the other indicates the ordinary way in which the soul departs from this world" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">took him.</span> Cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5, 9, 10</a>, where the same word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> is used of Elijah's translation; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). Though the writer to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>) adopts the paraphrase of the LXX., yet his language must be accepted as conveying the exact sense of the words of Moses. Analyzed, it teaches <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the patriarch Enoch did not see death, as did all the other worthies in the catalogue; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that in some mysterious way "he was taken up from this temporal life and transfigured into life eternal, as those of the faithful will be who shall be alive at the coming of Christ to judgment" (Keil). The case of Elijah, who was also taken up, and who afterwards appeared in glory on the mount of transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>.), appears to determine the locality into which Enoch was translated (which Kaliseh willingly leaves to antiquaries to decide) to be neither the terrestrial Eden (certain Popish writers) nor the heavenly paradise where the pious dead are now assembled - sheol (Delitzsch and Lange), but the realm of celestial glory (Keil). That the departure of the good man was witnessed by his contemporaries we may infer from what occurred in the case of Elijah; and, indeed, unless it had been so it is difficult to see how it could have served the end for which apparently it was designed, which was not solely to reward Enoch's piety, but to demonstrate the certainty and to stimulate the hope of immortality. That the memory of an event so remarkable should have survived not merely in Jewish (Ecclus. 44:16) and Christian tradition (<a href="../../par/jude/1-15.htm">Jude 1:15</a>), but also in heathen fable, is nothing marvelous. The Book of Enoch, compiled probably by a Jew in the days of Herod the Great, describes the patriarch as exhorting, his son Methuselah and all his contemporaries to reform their evil ways; as penetrating with his prophetic eye into the remote future, and exploring all mysteries in earth and heaven; as passing a retired life after the birth of his eldest son in intercourse with the angels and in meditation on Divine matters; and as at length being translated to heaven in order to reappear in the time of the Messiah, leaving behind him a number, of writings on religion and morality. The Book of Jubilees relates that he was carried into paradise, where he writes down the judgment of all men, their wickedness and eternal punishment" (Kalisch). Arabic legend declares him to have been the inventor of writing and arithmetic. The Phrygian sagsannacus (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: "nomen detortum ab Chanoch") is said by Stephanus Byzantinus, and Suidas, who corrupts the name into Nannacus, to have lived before the flood of Deucalion, to have attained an age of more than 300 years, to have foreseen the flood, gathered all the people into a temple and made supplication to God, and finally to have been translated into heaven. "Classical writers also mention such translations into heaven; they assign this distinction among others to Hercules, to Ganymede, and to Romutus (54:1:16: "nec deinde in terris fuit"). But it was awarded to them either for their valor or their physical beauty, and not, as the translation of Enoch, for "a pious and religious life." Nor is "<span class="accented">the</span> idea of a translation to heaven limited to the old world; it was familiar to the tribes of Central America; the chronicles of Guatemala record four progenitors of mankind who were suddenly raised to heaven; and the documents add that those first men came to Guatemala from the other side of the sea, from the East" (cf. Rosenm&uuml;ller and Kalisch, in <span class="accented">loco</span>).

To say that Lamech anticipated nothing more than that the youthful Noah would assist him in the cultivation of the soil (Murphy) is to put too little into, and to allege that" this prophecy his father uttered of him, as he that should be a figure of Christ in his building of the ark, and offering of sacrifice, whereby God smelled a sweet savor of rest, and said he would not curse the ground any more for man's sake, <a href="../../par/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>" (Ainsworth), is to extract too much from his language. Possibly he had nothing but a dim, vague expectation of some good thing - the destruction of sinners in the Flood (Chrysostom), the use of the plough (R. Solomon), the grant of animal food (Kalisch), the invention of the arts and implements of husbandry (Sherlock, Bush) - that God was about to bestow upon his weary heritage; or at most a hope that the promise would be fulfilled in his son s day (Bonar), if not in his son himself (Calovius). The fulfillment of that promise he connects with a recall of the penal curse which Jehovah had pronounced upon the soil. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the ground which the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- Jehovah</span>, by whom the curse had Been pronounced (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">hath cursed</span>. The clause is not a Jehovistic interpolation (Bleek, Davidson, Colenso), but a proof "that the Elohistic theory is unfounded" ('Speaker's Commentary').

Literally, a son of 500 years, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going in his 500th year (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/7-6.htm">Genesis 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>).

That the sons are mentioned in the order of their ages (Knobel, Kalisch, Keil, Colenso) may seem to be deducible <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the fact that they usually stand in this order (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-10.htm">Genesis 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the circumstance that it is commonly the eldest son's birth which is stated in the preceding list, though this is open to doubt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, which, according to Calvin, Knobel, Keil, and others, describes Shem as Japheth's elder brother; and <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>, which, according to Keil, affirms Ham to be the younger son of Noah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-31</a>, in which the order is reversed, but not otherwise altered. But there is reason to believe that Japheth was the eldest and Ham the youngest of the patriarch's children (Michaelis, Clarke, Murphy, Wordsworth, Quarry). According to <a href="../../par/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a> Shem was born 97 years before the Flood, while (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>) Noah was 600 years old at the time of the Flood. Hence, if Noah began to beget children in his 500th year, and Shem was born in Noah's 503rd year, the probability is that the firstborn son was Japheth. In accordance with this <a href="../../par/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a> is understood by LXX., Vulgate, Michaelis, Lange, Quarry, and others to assert the priority in respect of age of Japheth. In the narrative ahem is placed first as being spiritually, though not physically, the firstborn. Ranke perceives in the mention of the three sons an indication that each was subsequently "to lay the foundation of a new beginning." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN. The chronology of the present chapter represents man as having been in existence at the time of the Deluge exactly 1656 years. According to the Septuagint, which Josephus follows except in one particular (the age of Lamech), and which proceeds, again with two exceptions (the age of Jared, which it leaves untouched, and that of Lamech, which it increases by six), upon the principle of adding 100 to the Hebrew numbers, the age of man at the date of that catastrophe was 2262 (<span class="accented">vide</span> Chronological Table). The dates of the Samaritan Pentateuch, being manifestly incorrect, need not be considered. Adding to the above dates the subsequent chronological periods from the Deluge to the call of Abram (Hebrew, 367; LXX, 1017), from the call of Abram to the exodus from Egypt (430 years according to one calculation, LXX.; 730 according to another, Kalisch), from the exodus to the birth of Christ (1645, Hales; 1593, Jackson; 1491, Ussher; 1531, Petavius; 1320, Bunsen), the antiquity of man, according to the Biblical account, is not less than 5652 and not more than 7536 years. The conclusion thus reached, however, is somewhat scornfully repudiated by modern science, as affording, on either alter. native, an altogether inadequate term of existence for the human race. 1. The evidence of geology is supposed irrefragably to attest that man must have been upon the earth at least 1000 centuries, and probably ten times as long (Wallace on 'Natural Selection,' p. 303). The data for this deduction, as stated by Sir Charles Lyell, are chiefly the discovery, in recent and post Pliocene formations of alleged great antiquity, of fossil human remains and flint implements along with bones of the mammoth and other animals long since extinct ('Antiquity of Man,' <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. - 19.). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "So far as research has been prosecuted in the different quarters of the globe, no remains of man or of his works have been discovered till we come to the lake-silts, the peat-mosses, the river-gravels, and the cave-earths of the post-tertiary period," which seems at least an indirect confirmation of the Biblical record. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The tree canoes, stone hatchets, flint implements, and occasional fragments of the human skeleton," upon which so much is based, "<span class="accented">have</span> been chiefly discovered within the limited area of Southern and Western Europe," while "we have scarcely any information from the corresponding deposits of other regions;" consequently, "till these other regions shall have been examined - and especially Asia, where man flourished long prior to his civilization in Europe - it were premature to hazard any opinion as to man's first appearance on the globe." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "It is true that the antiquity of some of the containing deposits, especially the river drifts, is open to question, and it is also quite possible that the remains of the extinct quadrupeds may in some instances have been reasserted from older accumulations." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Historically we have no means of arriving at the age of these deposits; geologically we can only <span class="accented">approximate</span> the time by comparison with existing operations; while palaeontologically - the differences between these extinct pachyderms and those still existing are not greater than that which appears between the several living species, and would therefore indicate no great palaeontological antiquity - nothing that may not have taken place within a few thousand years of the ordinarily received chronology" (Page on 'The Philosophy of Geology,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. pp. 114-117). With these undesigned replies from a late eminent authority in geological science, the Bible student will do well to pause before displacing the currently-received age of man by the fabulous duration claimed for him by the first-named writers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
