If Jacob stayed two years at Succoth and eight in Shechem (Petavius), and if, as is probable, his residence in Shechem terminated with his daughter's dishonor (Lange), and if, moreover, Joseph s sale into Egypt happened soon after (Hengstenberg), Dinah may at this time have been in her sixteenth or seventeenth year (Kurtz). Yet there is no reason why she should not have been younger, say between thirteen and fifteen (Keil, Lange, Kalisch, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), since in the East females attain to puberty at the age of twelve, and sometimes earlier (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> - it is not implied that this was the first occasion on which Dinah left her mother's tent to mingle with the city maidens in Shechem: the expression is equivalent to "once upon a time she went <span class="accented">out"</span> (Hengstenberg) - <span class="cmt_word">to see the daughters of the land</span> - who were gathered at a festive entertainment (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:21, 1), a not improbable supposition (Kurtz), though the language rather indicates the paying of a friendly visit (Lange), or the habitual practice of associating with the Shechemite women (Bush), in their social entertainments, if not in their religious festivals.

Michaelis mentions an opinion still entertained in the East which explains the excessive indignation kindled in the breasts of Dinah's brothers, vie., that "in those countries it is thought that a brother is more dishonored by the seduction of his sister than a man by the infidelity of his wife; for, say the Arabs, a man may divorce his wife, and then she is no longer his; while a sister and daughter remain always sister and daughter" (vide Kurtz, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' (82) - <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shechem) - <span class="cmt_word">had wrought folly</span>. - the term <span class="accented">folly</span> easily passes into the idea of wickedness of a shameful character (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-12.htm">2 Samuel 13:12</a>), since from the standpoint of Scripture sin is the height of unreason (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-22.htm">Psalm 74:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>), and holiness the sublimest act of wisdom (<a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) - in (or against) <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> - the word, here applied for the first time to Jacob's household, afterwards became the usual national designation of Jacob's descendants; and the phrase here employed for the first time afterwards passed into a standing expression for acts done against the sacred character which belonged to Israel as a separated and covenanted community, especially for sins of the flesh (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>), but also for other crimes (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">in lying with Jacob's daughter</span>.

Assigned to the historian ('Speaker's Commentary'), or to the hand of a late redactor (Davidson, Colenso, Alford), there is no reason why these words should not have been spoken by Jacob's sons (Keil, Murphy, and others)' to indicate their sense of the new and higher morality that had come in with the name of Israel (Lange).

The ready acquiescence of the Shechemites to the proposal of Jacob's sons has not unreasonably been regarded as a proof that they were already acquainted with circumcision as a social, if not religious, rite (Kurtz, Keil, &c.). <span class="cmt_word">And every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</span> Knobel notes it as remarkable that the Hivites were not circumcised, since, according to Herodotus, the rite was observed among the Phenicians, and probably also the Canaanites, who were of the same extraction, and thinks that either the rite was not universally observed in any of these ancient nations where it was known, or that the Hivites were originally a different race from the Canaanites, and had not conformed to the customs of the land (vide Lange <span class="accented">in loco</span>). Murphy thinks the present instance may point out one way in which the custom spread from tribe to tribe.

That the other sons of Jacob and brethren of Dinah did not pursue their thirst for vengeance to the same extremity as Simeon and Levi seems apparent from ver. 27; yet it is quite possible that they joined with Simeon and Levi in the assault upon the city (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary') which they made - boldly, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either they themselves feeling confident of success because of the sickness which lay upon the inhabitants (Ainsworth, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, &c.), or, while the city was lulled into security in consequence of the treaty (Onkelos, Josephus, Keil, Lange), or perhaps referring only to the fact that they encountered no opposition, and came in safety (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) to the city (LXX., Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and slew all the males</span>.
