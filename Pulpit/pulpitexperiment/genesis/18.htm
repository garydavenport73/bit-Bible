The absence of Abraham's name has been thought to favor the idea that the present chapter should have begun at <a href="../../par/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a> (Quarry). That the time of this renewed Divine manifestation was shortly after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter is apparent, as also that its object was the reassurance of the patriarch concerning the birth of Isaac. <span class="cmt_word">In the plains of Mamre.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the oaks of Mature</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he sat in the tent door.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the opening of the tent</span>, a fold of which was fastened to a post near by to admit any air that might be stirring. <span class="cmt_word">In the heat of the day</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> noontide (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>), as the cool of the day, or the wind of the day (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), means eventide. "<span class="accented">The</span> usual term for noon is <span class="accented">Tsoharim</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-16.htm">Genesis 43:16</a>), that is, the time of ' double or greatest light,' while a more poetical expression is 'the height of the day' (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>), either because then the sun has reached its most exalted position, or because it appears to stand still in the zenith" (Kalisch). Among the Orientals the hour of noon is the time of rest (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/1-7.htm">Song of Solomon 1:7</a>) and the time of dinner (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-16.htm">Genesis 43:16, 25</a>). In this case the patriarch had probably dined and was resting after dinner, sines, on the arrival of his visitors, preparations had to be commenced for their entertainment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <i>them</i>, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him.</span> Not in addition to (Kalisch), but including (Keil), Jehovah, whose appearance to the patriarch, having in the previous verse been first generally stated, is now minutely described. That these three men were not manifestations of the three persons of the Godhead (Justin Martyr, Ambrose, Cyril), but Jehovah accompanied by two created angels (Keil, <span class="accented">et alii</span>, may be inferred from <a href="../../par/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>. When first perceived by the patriarch they were believed to be men, strangers, who were approaching his tent, and indeed were already close to it, or standing by him. <span class="cmt_word">And when he saw them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> understood that one of them was Jehovah, Jarchi rightly explaining that the word translated above "looked," i.e. with the bodily vision now implies an act of mental perception), <span class="cmt_word">he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground</span>. The expression denotes the complete prostration of the body by first falling on the knees, and then inclining the head forwards till it touches the ground. As this was a mode of salutation practiced by Orientals towards superiors generally, such as kings and princes (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>), but also towards equals (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-6.htm">Genesis 33:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-26.htm">Genesis 43:26</a>), as well as towards the Deity (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), it is impossible to affirm with certainty (Keil, Lunge) that an act of worship was intended by the patriarch, and not simply the presentation of human and civil honor (Calvin). If <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> inclines to countenance the latter interpretation, the language in which Abraham immediately addresses one of the three men almost leads to the conclusion that already the patriarch had recognized Jehovah.

Those who regard Abraham as unconscious of the Divinity of him to whom he spake see in his language nothing but the customary formula of Oriental address (Rosenm&uuml;ller; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">put not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</span> The hospitality of the Eastern, and even of the Arab, has been frequently remarked by travelers. Volney describes the Arab as dining at his tent door in order to invite passers-by ('Tray.,' 1. p. 314). "The virtue of hospitality is one of the great redeeming virtues in the character of the Bedouins (Kalisch). "<span class="accented">Whenever</span> our path led us near an encampment, as was frequently the case, we always found some active sheikh or venerable patriarch sitting 'in his tent door,' and as soon as we were within haft we heard the earnest words of welcome and invitation which the Old Testament Scriptures had rendered long ago familiar to us: Stay, my lord, stay.

The import of Jehovah's self-interrogation was, that since Abraham had already been promoted to so distinguished a position, not only was there no sufficient reason why the Divine purpose concerning Sodom should be concealed from him, but, on the contrary, the gracious footing of intimacy which subsisted between himself and his humble friend almost necessitated some sort of friendly communication on the subject, and all the more for the reason next appended.

The latter interpretation assigns as the reason of the Divine communication the knowledge which Jehovah then possessed of Abraham's piety; the former grounds the Divine resolution on the prior fact that Divine grace had elected him to the high destiny described in the language following.

The object the patriarch contemplated in his intercession was not simply the preservation of any godly remnant that might be found within the doomed towns, but the rescue of their entire populations from the impending judgment, - only he does not at first discover his complete design, perhaps regarding such an absolute reversal of the Divine purpose as exceeding the legitimate bounds of creature supplication; but with what might be characterized as holy adroitness he veils his ulterior aim, and commences his petition at a Point somewhat removed from that to which he hopes to come. Assuming it as settled that the fair Pentapolis is to be destroyed, he practically asks, with a strange mixture of humility and boldness, if Jehovah has considered that this will involve a sad commingling in one gigantic overthrow of both the righteous and the wicked.

It does not, however, follow that the Divine righteousness would have been compromised by consigning pious and wicked to the same temporal destruction. This must have been a spectacle not infrequently observed in Abraham's day as well as ours. Yet the mind of Abraham appears to have been perplexed, as men's minds often are still, by the magnitude of the proposed illustration of a common principle in Providence. Though prepared to admit the principle when its application is confined to solitary cases, or cases of no great amplitude, yet instinctively the human mind feels that there must be a limit to the commingling of the righteous and the wicked in calamity, though it should be only of a temporal description. That limit Abraham conceived, or perhaps feared that others might conceive, would be passed if good and bad in Sodom should be overwhelmed in a common ruin; and in this spirit the closing utterance of his first supplication may be regarded as giving expression to the hope that Jehovah would do nothing that would even seem to tarnish his Divine righteousness. Abraham of course regarded this as impossible, consequently he believed that Sodom might be spared.
