Its shores are clothed with loom and desolation. Within a mile from northern embouchure the verdure of the rich Jordan valley dies away. Strewn along its desolate margin lie broken canes and willow branches, with trunks of palms, poplars, and other trees, half embedded in slimy mud, and all covered with incrustations of salt.

The occurrence of this term, here mentioned for the flint time, implies the existence of a regularly-constituted form of worship by means of priests and sacrifice. Hence the Mosaic cultus afterwards instituted may only have been a resuscitation and further development of what had existed from the beginning. <span class="cmt_word">Of the most high God.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">El-Ellen</span>, a proper name for the Supreme Deity (occurring only here, in the narrative of Abram's interview with the kings); of which the first term, <span class="accented">El</span>, from the same root as Elohim (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, q.v.), signifies the Strong One, and is seldom applied to God without some qualifying attribute or cognomen, as El-Shaddai, or El, the God of Israel; and the second, '<span class="accented">Elion</span> (occurring frequently afterwards, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Psalms 9:2), describes God as the High, the Highest, the Exalted, the Supreme, and is sometimes used in conjunction with Jehovah (Psalm. 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), and with Elohim (Psalm 57:3 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 57:2<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), while sometimes it stands alone (Psalm 21:8 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 21:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>).
