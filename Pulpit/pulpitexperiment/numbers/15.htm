There is no external evidence, and the internal evidence is wholly indecisive. Neither can it be reasonably maintained that these regulations were designed to revive the hope and sustain the faith of the rising generation. Incidentally they may have had some effect in that way, but it is evident that the primary object of their promulgation was simply to supply certain defects and omissions in the Levitical legislation. Why that legislation should have had the fragmentary and unfinished character which it so evidently bears, requiring to be supplemented, here by an isolated commandment, and there by oral tradition, is an interesting and difficult question; but there can be no doubt as to the fact, and it is superfluous to look any further for the reason of the enactments here following.

An heave offering. See on Exodus 29:27; Leviticus 7:14.

No doubt this latter offering was a very ancient (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>) and general one, but it is not clearly described in the Law (see, however, <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>). All these heave offerings were the perquisite of the priest.

Perhaps it is a part of the thoroughly unscientific and inartificial character of the Mosaic legislation that a principle of extreme importance and wide application is appended to an insignificant matter of ceremonial. Provision is here made for the forgiveness of sins due to ignorance and oversight - a provision which was sorely needed, considering the great complexity of the Law, and the bad training they had for the accurate observance of it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>). A similar provision had been made in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>. The two, however, differ, inasmuch as <span class="accented">this</span> contemplates sins of commission, while <span class="accented">this</span> contemplates sins of omission. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded <i>Moses</i>, and henceforward among your generations;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">the day that the Lord commanded...  and henceforward among your generations.</span> Or, "thenceforward according to your generations." These words are obscure, because they point apparently to a much larger lapse of time since the first giving of the Law than had really occurred. It may be that they include the possibility of fresh revelations of the Divine will in the time to come. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a></div><div class="verse">Then it shall be, if <i>ought</i> be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">ought be committed.</span> Rather, "if it be committed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the non-observance of "all these commandments." It cannot, however, be necessary to suppose that a falling away from the whole body of the Mosaic legislation is here intended; such an apostasy could not happen by oversight, and if it did, the remedy provided would seem much too slight for the occasion. The analogy of the provision which follows (verse 27), and of the parallel provisions in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 13</a>, points clearly to the neglect of any one of the Divine commandments. <span class="cmt_word">One</span> <span class="cmt_word">young bullock for a burnt offering.</span> In the case of a sin of commission done ignorantly, the bullock was treated as a sin offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14, 20</a>), for in that case the expiation of guilt incurred is the prominent point in the atonement; in this case it is the necessity of a fresh self-dedication to the Lord. According to the manner, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span>, according to the ordinance given above. <span class="cmt_word">One kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> This was no doubt offered first, because expiation must precede self-oblation, but the bullock is mentioned first as forming the principal part of the sacrifice.

As the stranger was counted as of the nation for religious purposes, he shared both in its sin and in its forgiveness. There is no record of this atonement ever having been made, although there was abundant occasion for it; it may well be that it was intended only to stand on record against the Jews, and to point them to the one true expiation for their national as well as for their particular transgressions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27</a></div><div class="verse">And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any soul sin through ignorance.</span> No doubt by way of omission, as in the preceding case, and thus this regulation will be distinguished from that in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27</a>. In either case the ritual is apparently intended to be the same, although not so fully described here. In verse 29 the benefit of the ordinance is extended to strangers; this was natural in a law which directly contemplates the residence of Israel in their permanent home.

It is maintained by some that these words were intended to mark the contrast between the previous laws, which were only to be observed when the people came into their own land, and the law of the sabbath, which was strictly enforced during the period of wandering. There is no doubt that such a distinction existed in fact, but there is no reason to find the intentional assertion of it in this expression. The simpler and more natural, and therefore more <span class="accented">probable</span>, explanation <span class="accented">is</span>, that the incident was recorded after the people had left the wilderness. At the same time, there is nothing unreasonable in ascribing the narrative to Moses himself if we suppose him to have written it at the end of his life, when the people were encamped in the steppes of Moab. It seems probable that the record of the incident was inserted here as an example of a "presumptuous" sin, and of its punishment. A man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. This was clearly presumptuous, because the prohibition to do any work for oneself on the sabbath had been made so clear, and was so constantly forced upon their attention by the failure of the manna on that day, that ignorance could not possibly be pleaded here.

It seems an evasion to say that although death had been decreed, the mode of death had not been fixed; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it was clearly part of the Divine answer that the offence was really capital (see verse 35 a), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it was understood that in such cases death was to be inflicted by stoning (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>; in the last case the command was to bum the delinquents with fire, yet it was rightly taken for granted that they were to be stoned to death first). There are only two explanations which are satisfactory because they are honest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The incident may possibly have occurred between the first institution of the sabbath (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23, 29</a>) and the decree of death to those that broke it. There is nothing in the record as it stands here to contradict such an assumption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is more likely that it occurred after the departure from Sinai, and that the hesitation in dealing with the criminal was duo not to any real uncertainty as to the law, but to unwillingness to inflict so extreme and so (apparently) disproportioned a punishment for such an offence without a further appeal. If it be said that such unwillingness to carry out a plain command would have been sinful, it is sufficient to answer that Moses and Aaron and the elders were human beings, and must have shrunk from visiting with a cruel death the trivial breach of a purely arbitrary commandment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without the camp.</span> That it might not be defiled (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>).

If the covenant relation was to be maintained between God and Israel, the observance of the sabbath, which was an integral part of that covenant, must be enforced, and he who willfully violated it must be cut off; and this consideration was of exceptional force in this case, as the first which had occurred, and as the one, therefore, which would govern all the rest (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/5-5.htm">Acts 5:5, 10</a>). On the punishment of stoning see <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 15:37-41 THE LAW OF TASSELS (verses 37-41).

It seems to signify something flower-like and bright, like the blooms on a shrub; the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span>. is applied to the shining plate of gold upon Aaron's head-band (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a> it seems to mean a wing, and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> is a lock of hair. The exact meaning must be gathered from the context, and on the whole that suggests a tassel rather than a fringe. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, used in the parallel passage <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, seems to have this meaning. The Septuagint renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, which is adopted in the Gospels (see on Matthew 23:5). <span class="cmt_word">In the borders of their garments.</span> Literally, "on the wings," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The outer garment (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> here, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>) was worn like a plaid, so folded that the four <span class="accented">corners</span> were dependent, and on each of these corners was to be hung a tassel. It was also used as a coverlet by the poor (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband</span> <span class="cmt_word">of blue.</span> Rather, "that they put a string (or thread) of hyacinth-blue upon the tassel of the wing."

This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments. The later Jews, however, have always contrived, with all their minute observance, to break the plain letter of the law: thus the modern <span class="accented">talith</span> is an under, and not an upper, garment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments.</span> It was indeed a minute and apparently trivial distinction, and yet such an one as would most surely strike the eye, and through the eye the mind. It was like the facings on a uniform which recall the fame and exploits of a famous regiment. The tasseled Hebrew was a marked man in other eyes, and in his own; he could not pass himself off as one of the heathen; he was perpetually reminded of the special relation in which he stood to the Lord, whose livery (so to speak) - or, to use another simile, whose colours - he wore. No doubt the sky-blue string or thread which was so prominent was meant to remind him of heaven, and of the God of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye seek not after your</span> own <span class="cmt_word">heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring.</span> The office of the tassels was to promote a recollected spirit. As it was, their fickle minds were always ready to stray away towards any heathen follies which their restless eyes might light upon. The trivial but striking peculiarity of their dress should recall them to <span class="cmt_word">the</span> thought that they were a peculiar people, holy to the Lord.

The whole of religion, theoretical and practical, lay in those words, and that whole was hung upon a tassel. It is further to be noted that this precept was given during the years of exile, and probably given as one which they <span class="accented">could</span> keep, and which would be helpful to them, at a time when almost all other distinctive observances were suspended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
