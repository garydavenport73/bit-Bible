A very little reflection will show that "the Nazarene" not only was no Nazir, but that he even took pains to let it be seen that he was not. John the Baptist was the Nazir of the New Testament, and in all outward things the contrast was strongly marked between them (<a href="../../par/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14, 33, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate <i>themselves</i> to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate <i>themselves</i> unto the LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Either man or woman.</span> It was not a little remarkable that women could be Nazirites, because, generally speaking, the religious condition of women under the law was so markedly inferior and so little considered. But this is altogether consistent with the true view of the Nazirite vow, viz., that it was an exceptional thing, outside the narrow pale of the law, giving scope and allowance to the free movements of the Spirit in individuals. In this too it stood on the same plane as the prophetic office, for which room was left in the religious system of Moses, and which was designed to correct and supplement in its spiritual freedom the artificial routine of that system. As the prophetic office might be exercised by women, so the Nazirite vow might be taken by women. In either case we find a tribute to and a recognition of the Divine liberty of the Holy Ghost, and an anticipation of the time when the spirit of self-devotion should be poured out without distinction upon men and women. Shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the Lord. Rather, "shall make a solemn vow, a Nazirite vow, to live consecrated unto the Lord." The two words translated "separate" are not the same. The first (from <span class="accented">pala</span>, to sever, to consecrate, to distinguish as exceptional) is of somewhat doubtful use here. In <a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19</a> it appears to be used as an intensitive, "did wonderously," and the Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>. The other word (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, to separate) is used in a general sense in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>, or with the addition, "unto the Lord," as in <a href="../../par/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>. It had, however, acquired a technical sense before this, as appears from <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5, 11</a>, where the undressed vines are called "Nazirites," as recalling the unshorn  locks of those who had taken the vow. It is evident indeed, from the way in which the Nazirite vow is here spoken of, that it had been, perhaps long, familiar among the people. All that this commandment did was to recognize the practice, to regulate it minutely, and to adopt it into the religious code of Israel. Whence the custom was derived is wholly uncertain, for although the separate elements existed in many different quarters, yet the peculiar combination of them which made the law of the Nazirite is entirely peculiar. Vows of abstinence have, of course, been common among all religions. Mingled with much of superstition, self-will, and pride, they have sprung in the main from noble impulses and yearnings after a higher life, prompted by the Holy Spirit of God; and it may be said with some confidence, that in spite of all reproaches (deserved or undeserved), such voluntary vows of abstinence have done more than anything else to save religion from becoming an unreal profession. Hair offerings, on the other hand, springing from a simple and natural sentiment, have been common enough amongst the heathen. Compare the sacred locks of Achilles ('Iliad,' 23:142, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>), and the various use of the tonsure in pursuance of vows among the ancient Egyptians (Herod., 2:65) and amongst modern Mahomedans and Christians. The physical fact on which all these hair offerings rest is that the hair is the only portion of oneself which can be conveniently detached and presented.

Of grape-skins it is said that cakes were made which were considered a delicacy (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, mistranslated "flagons of wine"), but this is doubtful. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "wine of grape-skins (the liquor of grapes mentioned before) even to the kernel." The expression is best understood as including anything and everything, however unlikely to be used, connected with the grape. It is clear that the abstinence of the Nazirite extended beyond what might possibly intoxicate to what was simply pleasant to the taste, like raisins, or refreshing, like <span class="accented">charnels.</span> The vine represented, by an easy parable, the tree of carnal delights, which yields to the appetite of men such a variety of satisfactions. So among the Romans the Flamen Dialis might not even touch a vine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth <i>himself</i> unto the LORD, he shall be holy, <i>and</i> shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall no razor come upon his head.</span> The meaning of this law is <span class="cmt_word">best</span> understood from the case of Samson, whose strength was in his hair, and departed from him when his hair was cut. No doubt that strength was a more or less supernatural gift, and it went and came with his hair according to some supernatural law; but it is clear that the connection was not merely arbitrary, but was founded on some generally received idea. To the Jew, differing in this from the shaven Egyptian and the short-haired Greek, the hair represented the virile powers of the adult, growing with its growth, and failing again with its decay. To use a simple analogy from nature, the uncropped locks of the Nazirite were like the mane of the male lion, a symbol of the fullness of his proper strength and life (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25, 26</a>, and, for the disgrace of baldness, <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>). In later ages Western and Greek feeling on the subject prevailed over Eastern and Jewish, and a "Hebrew of the Hebrews" was able to argue that "even nature itself" teaches us "that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-14.htm">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>). No doubt "nature itself" taught the Greek of Corinth that lesson; but no doubt also "nature itself" taught the Jew of Palestine exactly the opposite lesson; and the Apostle himself did not quite discard the earlier sentiment, for he too made a Nazirite vow, and suffered his hair to grow while it lasted (<a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>). The meaning, therefore, of the law was that the whole fullness of the man's vitality was to be dedicated without any diminution to the Lord, as typified by the free growth of his hair. It has been conjectured that it was allowed to the Nazirite to "poll" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) his hair during his vow, although not to "shave" it (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and in this way the statement is explained that St. Paul "polled his head" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>, compared with Acts 21:24) in Cenchraea, because he had a vow. It is, however, quite evident that any permission to cut the hair is inconsistent with the whole intention of the commandment; for if a man might "poll his head" when he pleased, he would not be distinguished from other men. If it was allowed in the Apostle's time, it is only another instance of the way in Which the commandments of God were made of none effect by the traditions of men.

This may have had some foundation in fact, but the true explanation of the three rules is rather to be found in the spiritual truth they teach in a simple and forcible way. He who has a holy ambition to please God must <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> devote to God the whole forces of his being, undiminished by any wont and use of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> abstain not only from pleasures which are actually dangerous, but from such as have any savour of moral evil about them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> subordinate his most sacred private feelings to the great purpose of his life.

In all these cases, however, the vow was made for them before their birth.

In later days it became customary for richer people to defray for their poorer brethren the cost of their sacrifices (Josephus, <span class="accented">Ant.</span>, 19:6, 1; and cf. <a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:22-27 THE PRIESTLY BENEDICTION (verses 22-27).

As it concerned the priests and their daily ministration, it would be natural to suppose that it was given at the time when the tabernacle service was set up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the precise point fixed by the first verse of the following chapter. That the command was given to Moses, and to Moses alone, and that <span class="accented">after</span> the consecration of Aaron to the high priesthood, serves to bring out into clear relief the relative position of the two. Aaron and his sons alone, as the "official" representatives of the Lord, could bless in his name and put . his name upon the people; but the formula of blessing was delivered to Aaron himself through Moses, as the "personal" representative of the Lord, the mediator of the old covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>).

Blessing in or with the  name of the Supreme Being was an important part of all primitive religion, as appears from the case of Melchizedec and Abraham, of Isaac and his sons, of Jacob and Pharaoh. And this act of blessing was far from being a mere expression of good will, or from being a simple prayer; for" without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-7.htm">Hebrews 7:7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the blessing must be given by one who stands nearer to God to one who stands less near. The name of God could not be used in blessing save by one who had some right to such use of it, whether as prophet, as priest, or as patriarch. For that name in which the blessing was given <span class="accented">was</span> not inoperative, but was mighty with untold spiritual efficacy where rightly used as the name of blessing. To Aaron and to his sons was now confided this use of the Divine name, that all Israel might know and might hear in their appointed words the voice of God himself. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them.</span> The benediction here appointed consists of three clauses, each complete in itself, and each consisting of two members, the second of which seems to present the application and result in experience of the grace besought in the first. Both, therefore, in its form and its contents this benediction is one of the most profound and most fruitful of the Divine oracles; and this indeed we might have expected, because (if we may venture to say so) God is never so entirely and absolutely himself as in blessing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord,...  the Lord,...  the Lord.</span> Are we to see in this threefold use of the Divine name a shadowing forth of the Holy Trinity? It is obvious that it cannot be proved, and that it would not even have suggested any such idea to the priest who gave, or to the people who received, the benediction. To them the threefold form merely added beauty and fullness to the blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>). But that is not the question. The real question is whether the Old Testament was written for our sakes (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15, 16</a>), and whether the God of the Jews was indeed the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>). If so, it is not possible for us to avoid seeing in this benediction a declaration of the threefold Being of God, and it is not possible to avoid believing that he meant us to see such a declaration, veiled indeed from the eyes of the Jew, but clear enough to the Christian. For a somewhat similar case compare <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-27.htm">Numbers 6:27</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall put my name upon the children of Israel</span>. The "name of God is uniformly treated in Scripture as something very different from a mere arrangement of letters or an arbitrary vocal sound. All nations have bad names for the Supreme Being, but there was nothing sacred about them, except from association. <span class="accented">The</span> name of God was not of man, nor from man, but of his own direct revelation (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>), and was therefore of an unspeakable sanctity (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>). Like the "word" of God, it cannot be dissociated from God himself. It is in some sense an extension outwards, into the sphere of the created and sensible, of the ineffable virtues of the Godhead itself. It stands in a real, though un-assignable, relation to infinite goodness and power, and therefore it comes fraught with untold blessing (or perchance cursing) to those on whom it lights. Hence, to put the name of God - the covenant name - upon the people had a real meaning. No one could do it except by his express direction; and when it was so done there was an invisible reality answering to the audible form; with the name pronounced in blessing came the blessing itself, came the special providence and presence of God, to abide upon such at least as were worthy of it. It is a fact, the significance of which cannot be denied, that the name which was commanded to be put upon the people was lost, and irrecoverably lost, by the later Jews. Out of an exaggerated   dread of possible profanation, they first disobeyed the command by substituting Adonai for that name outside the sanctuary; and finally, after the death of Simeon the Just, the priests ceased to pronounce that name at all, and therefore lost the tradition by which the pronunciation was fixed. Our method of spelling and pronouncing the name as Jehovah is merely conventional, and almost certainly incorrect. It would seem to be the more devout opinion that the name itself, as revealed by God and uttered by many generations of priests, was forfeited (like Paradise), was withdrawn, and ought not to be inquired after. <span class="cmt_word">And I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">bless them.</span> Here is the precise truth of all effectual benediction: <span class="accented">they</span> shall put my name;...  <span class="accented">I</span> will bless. The outward form was ministered by the priests, the inward reality was of God and from God alone. It is observable that the form of blessing is expressed in the singular; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because all Israel was regarded as one, even as the first-born son of God (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because all real blessing must in truth be individual - a nation can only be blessed in its several members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
