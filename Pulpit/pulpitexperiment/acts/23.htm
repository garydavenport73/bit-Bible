Here, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> means to live in obedience to God. St. Paul boldly <span class="accented">asserts</span> his undeviating compliance with the Law of God, as a good and consistent Jew (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ananias</span>, the son of Nebedaeus, successor of Joseph the son of Camel, or Camydus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 1:3; 5:2), appears to have been actually high priest at this time. He was a violent, haughty, gluttonous, and rapacious man, and vet looked up to by the Jews ("tres considere," Renan). He had probably lately returned from Rome, having been confirmed, as it seems, in his office by Claudius, to whom Quadratus, the predecessor of Felix, has sent him as a prisoner, to answer certain charges of sedition against him. He seems to have been high priest for the unusually long period of over ten years - from A.D.  to A.D.  (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 5:2; 6:2, 3; 8:8). But, on the other hand, Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:5) speaks of a certain <span class="accented">Jonathan</span> being high priest during the government of Felix, and being murdered by the Sicarii at his instigation; which looks as if Ananias's high priesthood had been interrupt el. It would appear, too, from 20. 8:8, that Ismael the son of Fabi succeeded to Jonathan, net to Ananias, as is usually supposed. But the question is involved in great obscurity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <i>thou</i> whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">God shall smite thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). A distinct announcement of something that would happen. (For the incident itself, comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15, 17</a>; and <a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2, 23</a>) Ananias perished by the daggers of the Sicarii (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 2. 17:9), at the beginning of the Jewish war under the procuratorship of Florus, in the year A.D. . He had been previously deposed from the high priesthood by King Agrippa toward the close of the government of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8), about A.D. , or early in A.D. , less than two years from the present time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whited wall</span>. This expression is admirably illustrated by the quotations from Seneca in Kuinoel: "These base and sordid spirits are like the walls of their own houses, only beautiful on the outside." "What are our gilt roofs hut lies? for we well know that under the gilding unseemly beams are concealed." "It is not only our walls which are coated with a thin outward ornament; the greatness of those men whom you see strutting in their pride is mere tinsel; look beneath the surface, and you will see all the evil that is hid under that thin crust of dignity" ('De Provid.,' 6, and 'Epist.' 115). Ananias was sitting in his priestly robes of office, presiding over the council in power and dignity, and presumably a righteous judge, but his heart within was polluted with injustice, selfishness, and a corrupt disposition, which made him act unrighteously (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Contrary to the Law</span>; or, <span class="accented">acting illegally</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, only found here in the New Testament, but common in classical Greek. St. Paul's temper was very excusably roused by the brutality and injustice of Ananias. But we may, perhaps, think that he did not quite attain to "the mind that was in Christ Jesus," who "when he was reviled, reviled not again," but was "led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, he opened not his mouth" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-4.htm">Acts 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God's high priest</span>. This seems to show that Ananias actually was high priest, though some think that he had thrust himself into the office after his return from Rome, without due authority, and that this was the reason why St. Paul excused himself by saying, in ver. 5, "I wist not that he was high priest." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-5.htm">Acts 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- And Paul said</span> for <span class="accented">then said Paul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">high</span> for <span class="accented">the high</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a ruler</span> for <span class="accented">the ruler</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I wist not</span>, etc. These words express, as distinctly as words can express anything, that St. Paul was not aware, when he called Ananias a "whited wall," that he was addressing the high priest. Different reasons for this ignorance have been given. Some think that it arose from the uncertainty that existed whether Ananias really was high priest or not at this time, or whether the office was not in abeyance. Others attribute to Paul's weakness of sight the fact that he did not see that Ananias was sitting in the presidential chair, neither was able to recognize his features. Others, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> sense which it never bus, render, "I did not reflect," or "bear in mind, that he was high priest." What is certain is that for some reason or other Paul did not know that he was speaking to the high priest. Had he known it, he would not have said what he did say, because the Law is express which says, <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>, LXX.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.

With a ready wit, therefore, he proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and, seizing upon the great dogma of the resurrection, which Christians held in common with the Pharisees, he rallied to his side all who were Pharisees in the assembly. <span class="cmt_word">Of Pharisees</span>. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (in the plural), which gives the sense that his ancestors were Pharisees (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Touching the hope</span>, etc. (see <a href="../../par/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>). The words are somewhat difficult to construe. Some take "the hope and resin'. rection of the dead" for a hendiadys, equivalent to "the hope of the resurrection of the dead." Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> by itself, as meaning "the hope of a future life." Perhaps the exact form of the words is, "Touching the hope and (its ultimate object) the resurrection of the dead I am called in question." The article is omitted after the preposition (Alford). As regards St. Paul's action in taking advantage of the strong party feeling by which the Sanhedrim was divided, there is a difference of opinion. Some, as Alford, think that the presence of mind and skill with which Paul divided the hostile assembly was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise (<a href="../../par/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>; see Homiletics, 1-11) to suggest by his Spirit to those under persecution what they ought to say. Farrar, on the contrary, strongly blames St. Paul, and says," The plan showed great knowledge of character... but was it worthy of St. Paul?... Could he worthily say, 'I am a Pharisee'? Had he any right to inflame an existing animosity?" and more to the same effect (vol. it. pp. 325-328). But it could not be wrong for St. Paul to take advantage of the agreement of Christian doctrine with some of the tenets of the Pharisees, to check the Pharisees from joining with the Sadducees in crushing that doctrine. He had never thrown off his profession as a Jew, and if a Jew, then one of the straitest sect of the Jews, in any of its main features; and if he claimed the freedom of a Roman citizen to save himself from scourging, why not the fact of being a Pharisee of Pharisees to save himself from an iniquitous sentence of the Sanhedrim?

It seems, however, that there was a way of escape if they failed to keep the vow. Lightfoot, on this passage, quotes from the Talmud: "He that hath made a vow not to eat anything, woe to him if he eat, and woe to him if he do not eat. If he eat he sinneth against his vow; if he do not eat he sinneth against his life. What must such a man do in this case? Let him go to the wise men, and they will loose his vow" ('Hebrews and Talmud. Exercit. upon the Acts').

This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). "Holding or taking the right" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and with that of Beza, "Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply <span class="accented">latus</span>] munit." Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot.

But see <a href="../../par/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>, note. In the 'Annals' (12. 5) Tacitus further speaks of the incompetence of Felix to govern, stirring up rebellions by the means he took to repress them, and of the utter lawlessness and confusion to which the province was reduced by the maladministration of Felix and his colleague, Ventidius Cumanus ("cut pars provinciae habebatur"). He adds that civil war would have broken out if Quadratus, the Governor of Syria, had not interposed, and secured the punishment of Cumanus, while Felix, his equal in guilt, was continued in his government. This was owing, no doubt, to the influence of Pallas. The same influence secured the continued government to Felix upon Nero's accession, Pallas being all-powerful with Agrippina. Such was "the most excellent governor Felix." For further accounts of him, see Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:8; 13.), who ignores his share in the government as the partner of Cumauus, and dates his appointment subsequently to the con-detonation of Cumanus at Rome, and is also there silent as to his misdeeds. (For further accounts of Felix, see 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2; 8:5-7, which relate his adulterous marriage with Drusilla, and some of his murders and cruelties.)

According to Howson, following the American traveller, the Rev. Eli Smith, the route lay from Jerusalem to Gophna, on the road to Nablous, and from Gophna, leaving the great north road by a Roman road of which many distinct traces remain, to Antipatris, avoiding Lydda or Diospolis altogether. Gophna is three hours from Jerusalem, and, as they started at 9 p.m., would be reached by midnight. Five or six hours more would bring them to Antipatris, most of the way being downhill from the hill country of Ephraim to the plain of Sharon. Attera halt of two or three hours, a march of six hours would bring them to Caesarea, which they may have reached in the afternoon.
