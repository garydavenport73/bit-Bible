Schleusner takes the genitives in "threatening and slaughter" as genitives of the thing desired, "punting after threatening and slaughter" (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Meyer explains it "out of the threatenings and murder [in his heart] breathing hard at the disciples" - an expression indicating passion. Alford, taking nearly the sense of the A.V., makes "threatenings and slaughter" to be as it were the very material of his breath, whether breathed out or breathed in. Considering that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> means "to breathe in," as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, "to breathe out," and that these two are opposed to each other in Hippocrates (see Schleusner), the A.V. <span class="accented">breathing out</span> cannot be justified; nor is it likely that "Luke the physician" would forget the distinction. The difficulty is to explain the genitive case of "threatenings" and "slaughter." <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>; probably the same person who is so described in <a href="../../par/acts/7-1.htm">Acts 7:1</a> (where see note). If the year with which we are now dealing was the year A.D. , Caiaphas was high priest. But Alford, Lewin, Farrar, and others place Saul's conversion in A.D. , when Theophilus, son of Annas or Ananus, was high priest (Chronicles Table in Alford's 'Proleg. to Acts'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Asked</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">any that were of the Way</span> for <span class="accented">any of this way</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whether men</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">whether they were men</span>, etc., A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. To <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span>. No special reason is given why Damascus is singled out. But it is clear from vers. 10 and 13 that there was already a considerable number of Christian Jews at Damascus. And this, with the fact of there being a great multitude of Jews settled there, was a sufficient reason why Saul should ask for letters to each of the synagogues at Damascus, directing them to send any Christians who might be found amongst them bound to Jerusalem to be tried there before the Sanhedrim. There may have been thirty or forty synagogues at Damascus, and not less than forty thousand resident Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Way</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> holding the doctrine of Christ. Thus in <a href="../../par/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25, 26</a>, the Christian faith is spoken of as "the way of the Lord" and "the way of God." In <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>, was the term by which the faith of Christ was spoken of chiefly, perhaps, among the Jews. The term means a peculiar doctrine or sect. Its application to Christians apparently lasted only so long as Christianity was considered to be a modification or peculiar form of Judaism, and its frequent use in the Acts is therefore an evidence of the early composition of the book.

Some, as Lord Lytlelton and Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 48), from the expressions, "fell to the ground," "fell to the earth," infer that Saul was "himself mounted, and his followers some mounted and some on foot." And Farrar also, far other reasons, supposes that Saul and his companions rode horses or mules. The journey, he says, was nearly a hundred and fifty miles, and the roads rough, bad, and steep; and Saul was traveling as the <span class="accented">legate or</span> the high priest. Still it is strange that no one expression should point distinctly to the party being on horseback, which "falling to the earth," or "ground," certainly do not. While, on the other hand, the phrases, "Arise," "stood speechless," "led him by the hand," seem rather to point to his being on foot. Lunge well compares the double invocation, <span class="cmt_word">Saul, Saul</span>! with those similar ones, "Abraham, Abraham!" "Samuel, Samuel!" "Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" "Simon, Simon!"

And the Lord said unto him," are omitted in the R.T. They have, in fact, no manuscript authority (Meyer; Alford); and not much patristic authority, or from versions, and are omitted by all modern editors. They seem to be taken from the parallel narratives in <a href="../../par/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>.

(e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>) and in classical Greek. Here it means speechless from terror, struck dumb. The description here given by St. Luke seems to be contradictory in two particulars to St. Paul's own account in <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> and Acts 26:14. For St. Paul's companions are said here to have "stood speechless;" but in <a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a> they were "all fallen to the earth." Here they "hear the voice," but in <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> they "heard not the voice of him that spake." It is obvious, however, that in such descriptions all depends upon the particular moment of the transaction described which happens to be uppermost in the mind of the speaker or writer at the time, and the particular purpose in relation to which he is giving the description. Thus at one moment the spectators might be standing dumfounded, and at the next they might be prostrate on the ground, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> Either description of their attitude would be a true one, though not true with regard to the same moment. Again, if the purpose of the speaker was to affirm that the whole company were conscious of both the vision and the sound of a voice speaking, but that only Saul saw the Divine Speaker, the description "hearing the voice, but beholding no man" would be the natural one. Whereas, if the purpose was to express that Saul alone heard the words spoken to him by the Lord, the description of his companions," They saw indeed the light...  but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me," would be equally natural. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">Nothing</span> for <span class="accented">no man</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). So the best manuscripts and editions The idea is, not like that in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-8.htm">Matthew 17:8</a> that when he opened his eyes the person seen in vision had disappeared, but simply that his eyesight was gone, "for the glory of that light," and he could see nothing, but had to be led like a blind man (see <a href="../../par/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>).

The same reason, we may venture to think, which caused the interposition of three days' blindness between Saul's conversion and his baptism, led Saul himself to pass those days in a voluntary self-abasement. His sin in persecuting the Church of God and its Divine Head, his guilt in assisting at the death of God's saints, and in rejecting the testimony to Christ's resurrection, had been very great. These three days of blindness and of fasting were therefore a fitting preparation for the grace of forgiveness about to be so freely and fully given to him (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12-16</a>). What thoughts must have passed through Saul's mind during those three days! Before passing on, it may be well to observe that it is to this appearance to him of Jesus Christ that St. Paul undoubtedly refers when he says (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>), "Have not I seen Jesus Christ?" and again (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), "Last of all, he was seen of me also," where he puts this appearance of Jesus to himself on a par with those to Peter and James and the other apostles, which made them competent witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. And so in ver. 17 of this chapter Ananias says, "The Lord Jesus which was seen by thee" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); and Barnabas (ver. 27), when he brought Saul to the apostles, related "how he had seen the Lord in the way." And in <a href="../../par/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a> Ananias says, "God hath appointed thee to see the Righteous One." Moreover the description in ver. 7 of Saul's fellow-travelers, that they "saw no man," implies, by contrast, that Saul did. The reticence of both St. Paul and St. Luke as to what he saw, and what was the appearance of the Lord Jesus, seems to arise from profound reverence and awe, such as St. Paul speaks of in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>. It may be also worth remarking how this appearance of Christ was deferred till he was quite close to Damascus, according to one tradition only a quarter of a mile from the gates, but according to Porter, whom Farrar and Lewin follow, at a distance of about ten miles, at a village called Caueab. So the intervention of the angel by which Isaac's life was spared was not till Abraham had the knife in his hand to slay his son; and Peter's prison doors were opened not till the very night before he was to have been brought forth to death. Faith and patience are thus strengthened, and God's intervention is more marked. There is not the slightest trace in the narrative of what the fancy of many has suggested, that Saul's uneasy conscience was wrought up into a paroxysm as he approached Damascus, and so prepared the way for the vision of Christ. Even Canon Farrar's eloquent description of what he supposes to have been the thoughts which agitated Saul's mind on his eventful journey seems hardly to rest on any solid base (see 'Life of St. Paul,'vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.).

It still exists, and is called the Sultany Street; but instead of being the wide and splendid street it was in the apostolic age, a hundred feet wide, with colonnades separating the two footways on the side from the central read, and adorned with a triumphal arch, it is contracted into a narrow mean passage (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 69).

Ananias's answer shows his profound astonishment, mixed with doubt and misgiving, at the commission given to him. It shows, too, how the news of Saul's commission had preceded him, and caused terror among the disciples at Damascus.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-18.htm">Acts 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Straightway</span> for <span class="accented">immediately</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as it were</span> for as <span class="accented">it had been</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">received his sight</span> for <span class="accented">received sight forthwith</span>, A.V. and T.R.; he <span class="accented">arose</span> for <span class="accented">arose</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">As it were scales</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">scales</span>, or <span class="accented">flakes</span>; any thin substance which peals off; a frequent term in Greek medical writers. <span class="cmt_word">And was baptized</span>. It is a curious difference between St. Paul and the other apostles that, if they were baptized at all, which is doubtful, they must have been baptized by Christ himself; whereas St. Paul received his baptism at the hands of Ananias. This is one mark of his being "born out of due time." And yet he was not behind the very chiefest apostles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-19.htm">Acts 9:19</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- He took food and</span> for <span class="accented">when he had received meat he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and he was</span> for <span class="accented">then was Saul</span>, A.V. and T.R. Some commentators would interpose the journey to Arabia (mentioned <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>) between vers. 19 and 20; and this seems to be the intention of the A.V., where the clause commencing with <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (ver. 19) seems to wind up and close the preceding narrative. This too is the view strongly supported by Canon Farrar, vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>, and by Lewin. Alford places the journey to Arabia in the time comprised in ver. 22; others before ver. 22; Neander, Meyer, and others, in the time comprised in the "many days" of ver. 23. And this last is undoubtedly the easiest, were it not for the considerations urged by Farrar with great force as to the probability of St. Paul seeking a period of retirement after his conversion before commencing any public preaching, and the further countenance given to this view by <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, where St. Paul certainly says of himself that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, after his conversion he "went away to Arabia." Taking all things into consideration, and supposing that either Luke was not aware of the sojourn in Arabia, or that he omitted from his notes some brief notice of it immediately preceding the description of Saul's preaching in Damascus, which explained the following <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, it seems best to understand the latter part of ver. 19 and all that follows as subsequent to his return from Arabia; and to conclude that he only stayed at Damascus <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, a few days, after his conversion, and then retired to Arabia. It may be observed, too, that this interpretation gives a significance to the mention of the "certain days" which otherwise it has not. There is a further difference of opinion as to what is meant by <span class="accented">Arabia.</span> The most common view is that <span class="accented">Auranitis</span>, bordering upon Arabia Deserts, and reckoned as part of Arabia, not above two days' journey from Damascus, is the country meant. But others understand it in its more strictly Hebrew sense of the Peninsula of Sinai (Farrar, vol. 1. p. 212, and Exeursus 9; Dean Howson on Galatians in 'Speaker's Commentary;' Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>). This view is decidedly strengthened by the fact that, in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul clearly means by <span class="accented">Arabia</span> the Peninsula of Arabia, where Sinai was (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-25.htm">Galatians 4:25</a>). On the assumption that the Sinaitic Peninsula is meant, Bishop Lightfoot says, "He was attracted thither by a spirit akin to that which formerly had driven Elijah to the same region. Standing on the threshold of the new covenant, he was anxious to look upon the birthplace of the old; that, dwelling for a while in seclusion in the presence of the mount that burned with fire, he might ponder over the transient glories of the ministration of death, and apprehend its real purpose in relation to the more glorious covenant which was now to supplant it." His journey to Arabia need not necessarily have occupied more than two or three mouths. It seems certain that he did not preach there, because he says (<a href="../../par/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>), "I declared to them at Damascus <span class="accented">first</span>," etc. (see another coincidence between the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians in <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a></div><div class="verse">And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">In the synagogues he proclaimed</span> Jesus for he <span class="accented">preached Christ in the synagogues</span>, A.V. and T.R. The preponderance of manuscript authority, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of ver. 21, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 22, seem conclusive in favor of <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> rather than <span class="accented">Christ</span>. As regards the expression <span class="cmt_word">straightway</span>, we must understand it as descriptive of Saul's action upon his return from Arabia. Is it possible that St. Luke uses it with the same meaning as he may have heard St. Paul use it in when speaking of his Damascus preaching, in the same sense as St. Paul actually does speak in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, viz. as expressing that he did not wait for authority from the apostles, but at once, fresh from the Divine call, and having a direct commission from Christ himself, entered upon his apostolic ministry? If the Epistle to the Galatians was written A.D. , it would be just about the time that St. Luke joined St. Paul, and might be commencing to collect materials for his history. So that the phrase in the Galatians and the phrase in this twentieth verse might really be the expression of one thought committed to paper by St. Paul on the one hand, and uttered in the ear of Luke on the other. It is a confirmation of this view that in 2 Corinthians, written about the same time, there is also an account of Saul's escape from Damascus<span class="cmt_word">. In the synagogues</span>; the very synagogues (ver. 2) to which the letters of the high priest were addressed, empowering him to arrest either man or woman who called upon the Name of Jesus, and bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem to be tried before the Sanhedrim. No wonder they were amazed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-21.htm">Acts 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">But all that heard <i>him</i> were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - And for but, A.V.; <span class="accented">that in Jerusalem made havoc of</span> for <span class="accented">that destroyed them</span> (which called on this Name) <span class="accented">in Jerusalem</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and he had come hither for this intent</span> for <span class="accented">and came hither for that intent</span>, A.V., differently stopped; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The chief priests</span>.

As already observed, it presupposes the mention of Jesus, of whom it is thus predicated that he is both "the Son of God" and "the Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>, etc.). Observe the incidental proof of the general expectation of the Jews that Christ should come in this description of the apostolic preaching as directed to the one point that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ.

The <span class="accented">by</span> of the A.V. seems preferable to the <span class="cmt_word">through</span> of the R.V., as <span class="accented">through</span> suggests the idea, which cannot be intended, of making a hole in the wall. The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in <a href="../../par/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>), he uses the same word for "let down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), tells us he was let down "by the wall," R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and that it was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, Alford adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and holds <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, caused by the situation of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The R.T. cannot be right. "The disciples" is St. Luke's regular expression for "Christians" (<a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1, 2, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10, 19, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>), and is our Lord's name for his followers, but is never used by an apostle of his own followers (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4-7</a>).

The narrative thus far exactly agrees with <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17, 18</a>, which, however, supplies the motive of the journey to Jerusalem, which is not here mentioned, viz. to see Peter. It seems strange to some commentators that the news of Saul having become a zealous Christian should not have reached Jerusalem after an interval of three years. But first, we do not know. how much of those three years was spent in Arabia, nor how much the unsettled state of Damascus may have interrupted the usual communication between Jerusalem and Damascus, nor how suspicious of evil the poor persecuted disciples at Jerusalem may have been. They knew of the fierceness of Saul's zeal as a persecutor by their own experience; they knew of him as a disciple only by report. It may have been only an instance of the truth of Horace's maxim, "Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sunt occults subjecta fidelibus."

The other apostles were probably absent from Jerusalem during that fortnight; but Barnabas did, it seems, at a Church assembly, in the presence of James and, no doubt, the elders of the Church, give the astonishing narrative of Saul's conversion. This removed their suspicious and their fears, and he was freely, during the rest of his brief stay, admitted as a brother to their assemblies, and took part in preaching the gospel in the synagogues.

There is no reasonable doubt that it means the same place here. A seaport, near to Jerusalem, and with Roman protection, affording access to Tarsus either by sea or land as should seem best, was the natural place for Paul's friends to take him to. If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, "brought him down," as compared with the converse, "gone up" (<a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>), "ascended "(<a href="../../par/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">To Tarsus</span>.

It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>) that he came at this time "into the regions of Syria and Cilicia," which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch.

Thus did God's gracious providence intervene to give rest to his harassed saints, and to build up his Church in numbers, in holiness, and in heavenly comfort. Especially Paul had another breathing-time, which may have been the more required if, as is thought, one at least of the five scourgings mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:24 had been inflicted at Damascus, and one of the three shipwrecks alluded to in the same passage and been undergone in the dangerous coasting voyage from Caesarca to Scleucia.

Afford, following Meyer, understands "through all the saints," which is scarcely so well. The current of St. Luke's narrative is here temporarily diverted from St. Paul, in order to trace that portion of St. Peter's apostolic work, which led immediately to that opening of the door of faith to the Gentiles in which Peter was to have the priority in point of time (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18, 19</a>), but Paul the chief burden of labour and danger (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), and which was also the main subject of St. Luke's history. <span class="cmt_word">He came down</span>; Lydda (afterwards called Diospolis, now Ludd), being more than half-way between Jerusalem and the sea-coast at Joppa.
