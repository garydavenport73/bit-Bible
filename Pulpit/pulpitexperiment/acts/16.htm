Asia is here used in its restricted sense of that district on the western coast of Asia Minor, of which Ephesus was the capital. It is in this sense that it is used also in <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. St. Paul apparently wished to go to Ephesus. But the time was not yet come. It was the purpose of the Holy Ghost that the Galatian Churches should be founded first, and then the Churches of Macedonia and Achaia. The apostles were <span class="accented">sent</span>, did not go anywhere of their own accord (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5, 6</a>).

Thus was ushered in the most momentous event in the history of Europe, the going forth of the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem to enlighten the nations of the West, and bring them into the fold of Jesus Christ. Paul saw and heard this in a vision in the night. It is net called a dream (Bengel), but was like the vision seen by Ananias (<a href="../../par/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>), and those seen by Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-12.htm">Acts 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-5.htm">Acts 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>).

In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a> it means to "join together." In classical Greek to "bring together" in the sense of" reconciling," sometimes of" agreeing" to a proposition. In the LXX., to ,' instruct," "teach" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>). In this verse we first remark the very important introduction of the pronoun we into the narrative, marking the presence of the historian himself, and showing that he first joined St. Paul at Tread He went with him to Philippi (ver. 12), and there he appears to have stopped till St. Paul returned there in his third missionary journey on his way from Achaia to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 6</a>), where we find him still with the apostle (<a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 18</a>). We again find him with St. Paul at Caesarea, while he was a prisoner there (<a href="../../par/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>), and he accompanied him on the voyage to Rome, which is the last place where we heir of him (<a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2, 3</a>. etc.; Acts 28:2, 11, 14-16; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>). It is quite characteristic of Holy Scripture that things are told, or appear on the face of the narrative, without any explanation. Who Luke was, what brought him to Troas, how he became a companion of St. Paul, whether as his medical adviser or otherwise, we know not. His Christian modesty forbade his speaking about himself.

The natural way of construing the words undoubtedly is, as in the A.V., "which is the chief city of the [or, ' that'] district of Macedonia, and a colony." The only difficulty in the way of so taking it is that when AEmilius Paulus, as related by Livy (45:29), divided the conquered kingdom of Macedonia into four districts (<span class="accented">regiones</span> or <span class="accented">partes</span>), Amphi-pelts was made the capital of the district in which Philippi was situated. But the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> does not necessarily mean the capital; it is found on coins applied to cities which were not capitals. Besides, in the interval of above two hundred years between Aemilius Paulus and St. Paul (from s.c. 167 to A.D. ), it is very probable that the city of Philippi, with its gold-mines and its privileges as a colony, may have really become the capital. And so Lewin, following Wetstein, understands it (vol. it. p. 209). We know that in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia was divided into two provinces, Philippi became the ecclesiastical head of Macedonia Prima. It had been made a colony by Augustus Caesar, with the name "Col. Jul. Aug. Philip.," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). It must, therefore, anyhow have been a place of first-rate importance at this time. Those, however, who do not accept this explanation, couple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "which is the first colony-city," etc, Others take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> in a local sense, "the first city you come to in Macedonia" (Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Bengel, etc.).

Alford renders it, "which is the first Macedonian city of the district.' But the natural way of construing a passage is almost always the best, and nothing prevents us from believing that St. Luke, who knew Philippi intimately, was strictly accurate in calling it "the chief city of the district of Macedonia," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district in which it was situated. That <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical name of the division of a province appears from the title <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by Josephus to a certain Apollonius, governor, under Antiochus Epiphanes, of the district in which Samaria was included ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:5). The ancient name of Philippi was Dates first, then Krenides - the springs, or wells; and the word used by Livy of the districts of Macedonia, <span class="accented">pars prima, secunda</span>, etc., is an exact translation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> It received the name of Philippi, from Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who extracted a great revenue from its gold-mines. Its great historical celebrity arises from the battle in the plain of Philippi, in which the republican party, under Brutus and Cassius, received its death-blow from Octavius and Antony. (For a full description of Philippi, and of the privileges of a colony, see Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:311, etc., and Lewin, vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">This</span>. Alford, following certain manuscripts, reads <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in the city itself," as distinguished from the place outside the city, where the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> was. But, perhaps, St. Luke uses the word "this" from Philippi being the place of his own residence, and where he may have drawn up the narrative on the spot.

The river is not the Strymon, which is a day's journey distant from Philippi, but probably a small stream called the Gangas or Gangites, which is crossed by the Via Eguatia, about a mile out of Philippi. The neighborhood of water, either near a stream or on the seashore, was usually preferred by the Jews as a place for prayer, as affording facility for ablutions (see Josephus, 'Ant.

So in <a href="../../par/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, the litigants go to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, first, and he sends them on to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, or judge, who orders them for punishment. This seems a more probable explanation than that commonly adopted (Howson, Alford, Renan, Lewin, etc.), that the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> mean the same officers.

Nor is it likely that officers of such high rank as the duumviri, or proctors, as they had come to be called, should be always in the forum, to try every petty case (see articles "Colonia, Duumviri," and "Praetor," in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities'). It seems, therefore, that Meyer's explanation is right. At Athens the general term <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> was applied to inferior magistrates, as well as to the nine archons ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities' "Archon").

Philippi, being a colony, was governed by Roman magistrates called duumviri, corresponding to the two consuls at Rome. But we learn from Cicero that in his time the duuraviri in the colonies were beginning to be called praetors, a little previously used only at Rome ('De Leg. Agrar.,' 34), and to be preceded by lictors (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 35). Two inscriptions have been found in which the duumviri of Philippi are mentioned (Lewin, p. 26).
