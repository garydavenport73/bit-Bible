In ver. 4 "the ministry of the Word" is opposed to "the daily ministration" of meat. The passage gives a necessary warning to the ministers of God's Word not to spend too much time and strength upon any secular work, even though it be a work of charity. They must give themselves to the Word of God and to prayer. There are Christian laity to serve tables.

The number seven was, perhaps, fixed upon with reference to the exigencies of the service, some think because there were seven tables to be supplied; and partly perhaps from <span class="accented">seven</span> being the sacred number, the number of completeness - seven Churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven children (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>), seven times (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>). From seven having been the number of the first deacons arose the custom in some Churches of always having seven deacons, which continued some centuries in the Church of Rome. One of the Canons of the Council of Neo-caesarea (An). 314) enacted that "there ought to be but seven deacons in any city," and St. Mark is said to have ordained seven deacons at Alexandria (see Bingham, 'Christ. Antia' vol. 1. p. 232). But the needs of the Churches gradually superseded all such restrictions. <span class="cmt_word">Whom we may appoint</span>. The multitude elect, the apostles appoint.

He selects the incidents in the history of the Church at Jerusalem which connect themselves most directly with that after history which was the object he had in view. It has been thought by some that the Greek character of all seven names is an indication that they were Hellenists. Such a conclusion, however, is not warranted, as many Jews who were not Hellenists had Greek or Latin names, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Paul, Sylvanus, Aquila, Priscilla, Marcus, Justus, Petrus, Didymus, etc. At the same time, it is likely that some of them were. One, Nicolas, was a proselyte.

So in the sacraments, in confirmation, and ordination, the outward sign or rite is accompanied by prayer for the thing signified. And God's grace is given through the sacrament or rite in answer to the prayer of faith (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a>, and the Office for Baptism, the Prayer of Consecration in the Office for Holy Communion, and the Confirmation and Ordination Services). (For the laying on of hands as a mode of conveying a special grace and blessing, see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>.)

But this is probably a fanciful number; only it may be taken as an indication of the great number of such places of Jewish worship. Tiberias is said to have had twelve synagogues. Ten grown-up people was the minimum congregation of a synagogue. It seems by the enumeration of synagogues in our text that the foreign Jews had each their own synagogue at Jerusalem, as Chrysostom supposes, where men of the same nation attended when they came to Jerusalem; for the construction of the sentence is to supply before <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and again before <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> the same words as precede <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, SO as to mean "and certain of them that were of the synagogue called of the Cyrenians," and so on. The very numerous Jews of Cyrene and of Alexandria would doubtless require each a synagogue for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">The Libertines</span> were, as Chrysostom explains it, "freedmen of the Romans." They are thought to consist chiefly of the descendants of the Jews who were taken prisoners by Pompey, and deported to Rome, who were afterwards emancipated and returned to Judaea, though some (Meyer, 1:1) settled in Rome. Tacitus, under the year A.D. , speaks of four thousand Libertini, infected with Jewish or Egyptian superstitions, as banished to Sardinia ('Annal.,' 2. 85.). Many of these must have been Jews. Josephus, who tells the same story as Tacitus, though somewhat differently, says they were all Jews ('Ant. Jud.,' 18, 3:5). <span class="cmt_word">The Cyrenians</span>. Cyrene was the chief city in North Africa, and a great Jewish colony. Numbers of Jews were settled there in the time of Ptolemy Lagus ('Cont. Apion.,' 2:4), and are said by Josephus (quoting Strabo) to have been a fourth part of the inhabitants of the city ('Ant. Jud.,'14. 7:2). Josephus also quotes edicts of Augustus and of M. Agrippa, confirming to the Jews of Cyrene the right to live according to their own laws, and specially to send money for the temple at Jerusalem (16. 6:5). Jews from "the parts of Libya about Cyrene" are mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; Simon, who bore our Savior's cross, was "a man of Cyreue;" there were "men of Cyrene" at Jerusalem at the time of the persecution that arose about Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and "Lucius of Cyrene" is mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>. It was natural, therefore, that the Cyrenians should have a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Alexandrians</span>. Alexandria had a Jewish population of 100,000 at this time, equal to two-fifths of the whole city. The famous Philo, who was in middle age at this time, was an Alexandrian, and the Alexandrian Jews were the most learned of their race. The Jews settled in Alexandria in the time of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Lagus. The LXX. Version of the Scriptures was made at Alexandria primarily for their use. We may be sure, therefore, that they had a synagogue at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And of them of Cilicia</span>. The transition from the African Jews to those of Asia is marked by changing the form of phrase into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x2e;</span> There were many Jews in Cilicia, and this doubtless influenced St. Paul in preaching there, as well as the fact of its being his own native province (see <a href="../../par/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>). Josephus makes frequent mention of the Jews in the wars between the Ptolemies and Antiochus the Great, with whom the Jews sided, and in consequence were much favored by him. And it is thought that many who had been driven out from their homes by the wars, and others who were brought by him from Babylonia, settled in his time in Cilicia, as well as other parts of his Asiatic dominions. Seleucus also encouraged the Jews to settle in the towns of Asia in his kingdom, by giving them the freedom of the cities and putting them on an equal footing (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) with Macedonians and Greeks ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 3:1, 3). <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span>; meaning the same district as in <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a> (where see note). Evidence of the abundance of Jews in Asia crops up throughout the Acts (8. 16, 24, 42, 45; 14:19; 16:13; 18:26, 28; 19:17; 20:21). That the Jews of Asia were very bigoted we learn from <a href="../../par/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>).

It must be remembered that at this time the whole Jewish people were in a state of ill-suppressed frenzy and most sensitive jealousy for the honor of the Mosaic institutions - feelings which broke out in constant revolts against the Roman power.

"this fellow" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61, 71</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-29.htm">John 9:29</a>, etc.), is of itself an opprobrious expression (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/7-40.htm">Acts 7:40</a>), and the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Nazarene, is intended to be still more so.
