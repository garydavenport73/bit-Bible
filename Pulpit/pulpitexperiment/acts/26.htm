This is an additional detail not mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a> or <a href="../../par/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8</a>; but recalled here, as tending to confirm St. Paul's claim to be a thorough Jew, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and, moreover, to represent Christianity as a thing not alien from, but rather in thorough harmony with, the true national life and spirit of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">It is hard for thee to kick</span>, etc. This, also, according to the best manuscripts, is an additional detail not mentioned before. The proverb <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to kick against the ox-goads, as the unbroken bullock does to his own hurt, instead of quietly submitting, as he must do at last, to go the way and the pace his master chooses he should go, is found in Pindar, AEschylus, Euripides, Plautus, Terence, etc. The <span class="accented">passages</span> are given in Bochart, 'Hierozoicon.,' part 1. lib. it. Acts 39; in Kninoel, and in Bishop Wordsworth. The passage in Eurip., 'Baach,' 1. 793, 794 (750, 751), brings out the force of the proverb, viz. fruitless resistance to a superior power, most distinctly: "<span class="accented">Better</span> to sacrifice to him, than, being mortal, by vainly raging against God, to kick against the goads." Saul had better yield at once to the constraining grace of God, and no longer do despite to the Spirit of grace. It does not appear clearly that the proverb was used by the Hebrews. Dr. Donaldson ('Christian Orthodoxy,' p. 293) affirms that" there is no Jewish use of this proverbial expression." And this is borne out by Lightfoot, who adduces the two passages, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>, as the only evidences of the existence of such a proverb, together with a rabbinical saying, "R. Bibai sat and taught, and R. Isaac Ben Cahna kicked against him" ('Exereit. on <span class="accented">Acts</span>,' <span class="accented">9:</span>5). It is, therefore, a curious question how this classical phrase came to be used here. Bishop Wordsworth <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Even</span> in heaven our Lord did not disdain to use a proverb familiar to the heathen world." But, perhaps, we may assume that such a proverb was substantially in use among the Jews, though no distinct evidence of it has been preserved; and that St. Paul, in rendering the Hebrew words of Jesus into Greek, made use of the language of Euripides, with which he was familiar, in a case bearing a strong analogy to his own, viz. the resistance of Pentheus to the claims of Bacchus. This is to a certain extent borne out by the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9</a>); the latter of which is twice used in the 'Bacchae' of Euripides, though not common elsewhere. It is, however, found in 2 Macc. 7:19.

This does not allude to any preaching in the land of Judaea at the time of his first visit to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>), because he says in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>, that at <span class="accented">that time</span>, viz. before he went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, he was still "<span class="accented">unknown</span> by face unto the Churches of Judaea." But he had opportunities later of preaching in Judaea. For instance, the language of <a href="../../par/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a> suggests that such an opportunity may have arisen when Paul and Barnabas carried up the alms of the Christians at Antioch "unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea." Another opportunity he manifestly had when he passed with Barnabas through Phoenicia and Samaria to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="../../par/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>. Another, when he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. Again, there was room for working among the Jews in Palestine while he was staying at Caesarea "many days," and journeying to Jerusalem, as we read in <a href="../../par/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10, 15</a>.

The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. <a href="../../par/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.)

The excited interruption by Festus shows that he was unable to accept the truths enunciated by the apostle. The ideas of fulfilled prophecy, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of a crucified Jew giving light to the great Roman world, were" foolishness unto him," because he lacked spiritual discernment.

This saying of Agrippa's is obscure and variously explained. The A.V., following Chrysostom, Beza, Luther, etc., takes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "within a little" or" almost," like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which is very suitable to the context. The corresponding <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, or, as otherwise read, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would then mean, as in the A.V., "altogether," and the sense of the whole passage is striking and appropriate. But there is some difficulty in getting Otis meaning out of the words. The natural way of expressing it would be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>. Hence many other commentators take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "in a short time," and the sense to be either "you are making short work of my conversion: you are persuading me to become a Christian as suddenly as you yourself did;" with a corresponding sense for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in a long time," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether it takes a short or a long time, I pray God you may become a Christian like myself;" or, "you are soon persuading me," you will soon persuade me if you go on any longer in this strain. Others, again, preferring the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> in ver. 29, take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "with little trouble," or "with few words," as <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a> (understanding <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), "lightly" (Alford), and then the opposite <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would mean "with much trouble," "with many words," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with difficulty." But this is rather a fiat rendering. Another difference of opinion is whether the words of Agrippa are to be taken ironically, or sarcastically, or jestingly, or whether they are to be taken seriously, as the words of a man shaken in his convictions and seriously impressed by what he had heard. The whole turn of the narrative seems to favor the latter view. Another view, started by Chrysostom, is that Agrippa used the words in one sense, and St. Paul (mistakenly or advisedly) took them in another. Another possible explanation is that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> is here used in the sense in which Thucydides employs the phrase (it. 86 and Ephesians 4:26), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "in a narrow place;" and that Agrippa meant to say, "By your appeal to the prophets you press me hard; you have got me into a corner. I am in a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a ' narrow room; ' I hardly know how to get out of it." The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would then mean a" large room," a <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="accented"><a href="../../par/psalms/30.htm">Psalm 30</a>:</span>8).

Accordingly Agrippa now gives it as his opinion that the prisoner might have been discharged if he had not appealed to Caesar. Festus was of the same opinion, and doubtless wrote to Nero to that effect.
