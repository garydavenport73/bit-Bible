That Melita is the island of <span class="accented">Malta</span>, and not <span class="accented">Meleda</span> off the coast of Dalmatia, is demonstrated in Smith's ' Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul,' and it is not worth while here to consider the arguments in favor of Meleda. <span class="accented">Melita</span> appears to be a Phoenician name, from the root in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, to escape (Bochart, 'Canaan,' 1:26), meaning, therefore, a "refuge," a harbor of refuge so called from sailors often running into Valetta during a gale; or possibly from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;</span>, clay, in Italian <span class="accented">malta</span>, from the clay which forms the bottom of the sea as you approach Malta, and which makes the anchorage so safe. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians, whether from Tyre or Carthage cannot be pronounced with certainty, though we know it was a Carthaginian possession at the time of the first Punic War. It fell into the hands of the Romans  <span class="date">B.C. 218</span>, and at the time of St. Paul's shipwreck was annexed to the province of Sicily. The population, however, was Phoenician or Punic, and probably knew little Greek or Latin. The name of a fountain in St. Paul's Bay, <span class="accented">Ayn tal Razzul</span>, "The Apostle's Fountain," is said (Smith, p. 24) to be Phoenician. But this is extremely doubtful. It is far more probably, not to say certainly, the corrupt Africano-Arabic dialect of the island, as I venture to affirm on the high authority of Professor Wright. Gesenius is also distinctly of opinion that there are no remains of Phoenician in the Maltese, and that all the words in the Maltese language which have been thought to be Phoenician are really Arabic. Four genuine Phoenician inscriptions have, however, been found in the island ('Monument. Phoenic,' pars prima, pp. 90-111,252, and 341).

The word only occurs in the New Testament here; it means "dry sticks," "kindlers," any combustible material. In the LXX. it is used as the equi- valent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, straw or stubble (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, etc.), and for "nettles" (<a href="../../par/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>). Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - "When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood." This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). <span class="cmt_word">A viper came out</span>. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. <span class="accented">Came out.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., "came out through the sticks." It is a frequent medical term. <span class="cmt_word">The heat</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>.

It occurs, however, repeatedly in the LXX. (<a href="../../par/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; Ecclus. 38:34, etc.), and was the usual medical word for feverish heat. <span class="cmt_word">Fastened</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>, here only in the Bible; but not uncommon in classical Greek, and of general use among medical writers.

In her train was Poena, of whom Horace says," Rare antecedeutem scelcstum Deseruit pede Poena claude" ('Od.,' 3:2, 32). "The idea of <span class="accented">Dice</span> as justice personified is most perfectly developed in the dramas of Sophocles and Euripides" (article "Dice," in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Biog. and Mythol.'). It does not appear whether the islanders had learned the name and office <span class="accented">of Dice</span> from the Greeks in Sicily, or whether they had any native divinity whose name St. Luke translates into that of <span class="accented">Dice.</span> The gods whose names are found in ancient Maltese inscriptions are <span class="accented">Melkarth</span>, another name of Hercules, the tutelar god of Tyre; <span class="accented">Osiris</span>, and <span class="accented">Baal.</span> Other Phoenician divinities are named in the Carthaginian inscriptions (see Gesenius, 'Monument.

It is also common in the LXX. But it is a word much employed by medical writers in speaking of the course they <span class="accented">expect</span> a disease to take, and the results they look for. And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">be</span>sides those immediately preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (according to several good manuscripts and editions) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

But it is the usual medical word for "inflammation" in any part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Fallen down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and in <a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing amiss</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), "shall suffer no harm." It is used in medical writers in two senses - of" unusual symptoms," and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>, "Nothing amiss;" and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>.

It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in <a href="../../par/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> (see further note on ver. 8).

One would have thought that this ship wintering at Malta on its way from Alexandria to Italy, via Sicily, would be of itself a sufficient proof that Melita was Malta. <span class="cmt_word">Which had wintered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Whose sign was The Twin Brothers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Latin the constellation <span class="accented">Gemini</span>). The twin sons of Jupiter and Leda, Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helena ("fratres Helenis, lucida sidera," Horace, 'Od.,' 1:3, 2), were called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Dioscuri, the</span> sons of Jove. It was their special office to assist sailors in danger of shipwreck. Hence Horace, in the ode just quoted, prays that Castor and Pollux, in conjunction with other deities, would carry the ship in which Virgil sailed safe to Attica. And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons. It was, therefore, very natural to have the Dioscuri for the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the sign of the ship.

(Alford), which was called the <span class="accented">tutela.</span> These were sometimes the same, and perhaps were so in this instance. Ovid tells us that Minerva was the <span class="accented">tutela</span> of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like. We may notice the continual trial to Jews and Christians of having to face idolatry in all the common actions of life.

St. Luke only uses this word in one other passage, <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>," The strolling [or, 'vagabond'] Jews;" and it has the same sense of "wandering" in the only other passages where it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). If it is the right reading here, the meaning must be "tacking," the wind not allowing them to sail in a direct course. "I am inclined to suppose that the wind was north-west, and that they worked to windward, availing themselves of the sinuosities of the coast. But with this wind they could not proceed through the Straits of Messina .... They were, therefore, obliged to put into Rhegium But after one day the wind became fair (from the south), and on the following day they arrived at Puteoli, having accomplished about one hundred and eighty nautical miles in less than two days" (Smith, p. 156). But Meyer explains it, "after we had come round," viz. from Syracuse, round the eastern coast of Sicily. Lewin thinks they had to stand out to sea to catch the wind, and so arrived at Rhegium by a circuitous course. The other reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a>; but this seems to give no proper sense here. <span class="cmt_word">A south wind sprang up</span>.

The younger and more active would go as far as Appii Forum, "a village on the Via Appia, forty-three miles from Rome" (Meyer). The rest only came as far as <span class="cmt_word">The Three Taverns</span>, ten miles nearer to Rome. Alford quotes a passage from Cicero's letters to Atticus (it. 10), in which he mentions both "Appii Forum" and the "Tres Tabernae;" and refers to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 17. 12:1) for a similar account of Jews at Rome, who, on hearing of the arrival of the pretended Alexander at Puteoli, went out in a body to meet him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). He also quotes from Suetonius the passage in which he tells us that, on Caligula's return from Germany, "populi Romans sexum, aetatem, ordinem omnem, usque ad Vicesimum lapidem effadisse se" ('Calig.,' c. 4). Appii Forum was not far from the coast, and was a great place for sailors and innkeepers (Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:5, 3). The Via Appia was made by Appius Claudius,  <span class="date">B.C. 442</span>. It led from the Ports Capena in Rome through the Pontino marshes to Capua.

There were usually two great officers so called, and it was their special duty to take charge of prisoners sent from the provinces to be tried at Rome. 'Vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii met debet" (Pliny, 'Epist.,' 10:65). It has been argued, from the mention of "the captain of the guard," that Paul's imprisonment must have occurred when Burrus was sole prefect, as related by Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:42, 1), and that hence we get a precise date for it (so Wieseler, 'Chronologic de Apostolisch. Geshichte'). But this can hardly be depended upon. Luke might speak of "the prefect," meaning the one to whom the prisoners were actually committed, just as we might speak of a magistrate writing to "the secretary of state," or an ambassador calling upon "the secretary of state," the matter in hand determining which of the three secretaries we meant. <span class="cmt_word">With the soldier that guarded him</span>.

This is a detail not expressly mentioned in the direct narrative in <a href="../../par/acts/25.htm">Acts 25</a>, but which makes that narrative clearer. It shows us that Festus's proposal in <a href="../../par/acts/25-9.htm">Acts 25:9</a> was made in consequence of the opposition of the Jews to the acquittal which he was disposed to pronounce. <span class="cmt_word">I was constrained to appeal</span>. Nothing can be more delicate, more conciliatory, or more truly patriotic than Paul's manner of addressing the Jews. Himself a Hebrew of the Hebrews, devoted to his kinsmen according to the flesh, never even putting forward his own privilege as a Roman citizen till the last necessity, he shows himself the constant friend of his own people in spite of all their ill usage. Undazzled by the splendor of Rome and the power of the Roman people, his heart is with his own despised nation, "that they might be saved." He wishes to he well with them; he wants them to understand his position; he speaks to them as a kinsman and a brother. His appeal to Caesar had been of necessity - to save his life. But he was not going to accuse his brethren before the dominant race. His first desire was that they should be his friends, and share with him the hope of the gospel of Christ.

But here and <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-2.htm">Hebrews 5:2</a> the construction is different, and the subject and the object are reversed. Instead of the chain encompassing Paul, Paul is said to be bound with the chain. (For the <span class="accented">chain</span>, see ver. 16, note, and <a href="../../par/acts/24-23.htm">Acts 24:23</a>.) The force of this saying seems to be this, "I have asked you to come to me because this chain which binds me is not a token of a renegade Israelite who has come to Rome to accuse his nation before the heathen master, but of a faithful Israelite, who has endured bondage rather than forsake the hope of his fathers." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/28-21.htm">Acts 28:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- From</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nor</span> for <span class="accented">neither</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak</span> for <span class="accented">any of the brethren that came showed or spake</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Nor did any of the brethren come hither</span>, etc. This is no improvement on the A.V.; for it implies that they denied that any special messenger had been sent to speak harm of Paul, which nobody could have thought had been done. What they meant to say is exactly what the A.V. makes them say, viz. that, neither by special letters, nor by message nor casual information brought by Jews coming to Rome from Judaea, had they heard any harm of him. This seems odd; but as the Jews had no apparent motive for not speaking the truth, we must accept it as true. The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius (<a href="../../par/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>) may have slackened the intercourse between Judaea and Rome; the attention of the Jews may have been absorbed by their accusation of Felix; there had been a very short interval between Paul's appeal and his departure for Rome; he had only been at Rome three days, and so it is very possible that no report had yet reached Rome concerning him at this early season of the year.

The Hebrew reads, as it is rendered in the A.V.," Hear ye,...  and see ye," etc., in the imperative mood, not differing much in sense (in prophetical language) from the future. It is impossible to give the force in English exactly of the repetition of the verb in the infinitive mood <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span> by a very common Hebrew idiom. It is done imperfectly by the word "indeed." Rosenmuller quotes from Demosthenes ('Contr. Aristogit.,' 1.) the proverbial saying, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>

It is found repeatedly in the LXX., and, in the form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in classical writers. The word "mystery" is etymologically connected with it. The word here expresses the <span class="accented">willfulness</span> of their unbelief: "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life."

The boldness and freedom with which he spake <span class="cmt_word">the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ</span> would naturally increase more and more, as he found himself day by day unchecked by enemies, and encouraged by the number and earnestness of his hearers. <span class="cmt_word">None forbidding him</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the New Testament; but the adjective is found in Symmachus's version of Job (Job 34:31), and in the LXX. of Wisd. 7:22; and both adjective and adverb are occasionally used in classical Greek. But the most common use of the adverb is by medical writers, who employ it "to denote freedom, unhindered action, in a variety of things, such as respiration, perspiration, the pulse, the muscles, the members of the body" (Hobart). In two passages quoted from Galen ('Meth. Med.,' 14:15; 'Usus Part.,' 2:15) the sentence ends, as here, with the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> Some derive the word "acolyte" hence, from their being admitted to holy functions, though not in full orders. And so ends this lively and beautiful and most faithful sketch of one of the greatest men, and one of the greatest works, the world has ever seen. "In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft," is seen, as we read this history, to be no empty boast, but a simple statement of the truth. The springs of that mind and of that zeal were ever ready to rise to fresh work, however crushing a strain had been put upon them. "I count not my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God," is the true description of that life as delineated by the beloved physician. And yet how remarkable it is that in the whole of the Acts there is not one single word of panegyric! The portraiture is a bare photograph, without a single additional touch to enhance its beauty. Nor must we forget the singular brevity with which some episodes are passed over. Had we only Luke's history, we should not know that the apostle was an author - an author whose writings have moved the world of mind and spirit more than all the writings of Plato, and Aristotle, and Cicero, and Bacon combined, through a period of eighteen hundred years. Thus, to glance at the "two whole years" with the record of which the book closes, think of the work clone in that time. What gatherings of holy men and women within the walls of that "hired dwelling" are we sure must have taken place! Prisca and Aquila, and Epaenetus, and Mary, and Urban, and Apelles, and Persis, and Hermas, and Olympas, and all their compeers, we may be sure were often there. What wrestlings in prayer, what expositions of the Scriptures, what descriptions of the kingdom of God, what loving exhortations, what sympathetic communings, must have made that "hired dwelling" a very Bethel in the stronghold of heathenism! We think of the praetorian soldiers to whom he was successively chained; perhaps of the courteous Julius; of the inmates of Nero's palace (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a>); perhaps of Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>); of Epaphras and Epaphroditus, and of Luke, and Mark, and Timothy, and Aristarchus, and we know not how many more besides; and there rises before our minds a crowd of agencies and sober activities directed by that master mind to the advancement of the kingdom of God. We feel, indeed, that, though he was chained, "the word of God was not bound;" but that through the marvelous energy and unfailing wisdom of the great prisoner, his prison turned out rather to the furtherance of the gospel. And then we turn to the Epistles written at this time. What a contribution to the literature of the kingdom of heaven!-the Epistles to the Ephesians, to the Colossions, to Philemon, and to the Philippians, and probably much help given to Luke in the composition of the Acts of the Apostles. Truly they were two years of infinite moment to the Church of God. What followed those two years, what became of Paul, and what of his saintly biographer, we shall never know. It has pleased God to draw a curtain ever the events, which we cannot penetrate. Here our history ends, because nothing more had happened when it was given to the Church. Instead of vain regrets because it reaches no further, let us devoutly thank God for all that this book has taught us, and strive to show ourselves worthy members of that Gentile Church, whose foundation by St. Peter and St. Paul, and whose marvelous increment, through the labors of him who once laid it waste, has been so well set before us in the Book of THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/27.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 27"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 27" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../romans/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Romans 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Romans 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
