A wonder was a miracle, the performance of which gave proof of a Divine commission (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). These signs, it is assumed, should come to pass; nevertheless, the people were not to listen to the man who gave them to go after other gods. The mere fact that he sought to persuade them to forsake the worship of Jehovah was sufficient to prove him an impostor; for how could one who sought to seduce the people from God be sent by God? The sign which was given to authenticate such a message could only be one of those "lying signs and wonders after the working of Satan," by which his emissaries try to deceive and mislead; and was permitted by God only that their fidelity to him might be tested and proved. They had already received God's message; they had his word; and no teaching which contravened that, however apparently authenticated, could be from him, or was to he accepted by them (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>, etc.). Come what might, they were to <span class="cmt_word">walk after Jehovah their God, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and serve him; and cleave unto him.</span> The false prophet, as a public enemy and a suborner of treason against the King of Israel, was to be put to death; and so the evil would be put away from among them.

Not only was this to be resisted, but no consideration of affection or bend of friendship was to be allowed to interfere with the stern sentence which doomed the tempter to death; on the contrary, the person tempted was to be the first to lay hands on the tempter and put him to death. This was to be done by stoning, and the person he had tried to seduce was to cast the first stone. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy brother, the son of thy mother</span>; thy full brother, allied to thee by the closest fraternal tie. The wife of thy Bosom; the object of thy tenderest affection, Whom it is thine to protect and cherish (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy friend, which is as thine own soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. whom thou lovest as thyself.

Nic.,' 9:5). As commonly used, however, the word designates any one with whom one has any dealing or intercourse; and so our Lord expounds it (<a href="../../par/luke/10-29.htm">Luke 10:29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Secretly</span>.

In this case inquiry was to be made as to the fact; and if it was found to be so, the inhabitants of that city were to be put to the sword, all their property was to be burnt, and the city itself reduced to a heap; so should the anger of the Lord be averted from Israel, and he would do them good. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear in one of thy cities.</span> The Hebrew phrase, "to hear in" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>). has sometimes the meaning of to overhear, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>; sometimes it means simply to hear, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a> [35]; in <a href="../../par/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, it has the force of to hear of or concerning, though some think this questionable. This latter is apparently the meaning here: If thou <span class="accented">hear concerning any of thy cities</span>, etc. Baying. This introduces what is heard. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Certain</i> men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Men, the children of Belial</span>; the <span class="accented">sons of worthlessness</span>, utterly worthless persons. <span class="accented">Beli ya'al</span> (a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, not, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>, to ascend, to have worth, to profit) means primarily that which is low, hence worthlessness, naughtiness, wickedness. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>, Belial is rendered in the Authorized Version as an adjective, "wicked," and also in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>. In <a href="../../par/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>, it is rendered by "ungodly men." Most commonly it is treated as a proper name. But in all places the proper meaning of the word might be retained. The Hebrews described an object, of which any quality was predominantly characteristic, as the son of that quality. <span class="cmt_word">Are gone out from among you</span>; have gone forth from the midst of you, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. have risen up among yourselves. <span class="cmt_word">Withdraw</span>.
