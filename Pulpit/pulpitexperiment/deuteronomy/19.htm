That roads, however, properly so called, were not unknown to the Hebrews, even in early times, is evident, not only from this passage, but also from <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-22.htm">Numbers 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-27.htm">Deuteronomy 2:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>. The design of the injunction here was that every facility should be afforded to the fugitive to escape to the place of refuge. In later times, it was enacted that the roads leading to these cities should be repaired every year in the month Adar, and every obstruction removed.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a></div><div class="verse">If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:</div><div class="comm">

In the earlier legislation, it is enacted that the congregation shall judge in such matters, and that by their decision it should be determined in any case whether the person who had slain another was to be allowed to remain in a city of refuge or be delivered over to the avenger of blood. With this the ordinance here is not inconsistent; the elders were not to act as judges, but merely as magistrates, to apprehend the man and bring him to trial.

Landmarks were held sacred, and a curse is pronounced against those who remove them (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-10.htm">Proverbs 23:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>). Among other nations also landmarks were regarded as sacred (cf. Plato, 'De Legibus,' 8. p. 842; Dionys. Halic. 2:17; Plutarch, 'Numa,' 16; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of old time</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. those of a former age (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, earlier ones, ancestors, predecessors). The word does not necessarily imply that the age described as "former" was removed at a <span class="accented">great</span> distance in the past; it might designate men of the immediately preceding age. The LXX. have here <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">priores</span>. That the law here given was uttered whilst Israel was yet outside of Canaan, is evident from what follows in this verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a></div><div class="verse">One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-21.</span> - To secure against injury to life or property through inadequate or false attestation, it is enacted that more than one witness must appear before anything can be established; and that, should a witness be found on trial to have testified falsely against his neighbor, he was to be punished by having done to him what he thought to have done to his neighbor (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The rule in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>, regarding accusations of idolatry, is here extended to accusations of every kind before a court of justice; a single witness was not to be admitted as sufficient to convict a man of any offence, either civil or criminal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a></div><div class="verse">If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him <i>that which is</i> wrong;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To testify against him</span> <span class="cmt_word">that which is wrong</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">testify against him defection</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the Law of God. The speaker has apparently in view here all such defections from the Law as would entail punishment on the convicted offender. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a> [6], indeed, the crime described here as "that which is wrong" (margin, "falling away") is specially the crime of apostasy to idolatry; but the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), though usually expressing apostasy from Jehovah, has properly the general sense of a deflection from a prescribed course (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to go off, to go aside), and so may describe any departure from what is constituted right.
