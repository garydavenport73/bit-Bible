God is called "the Rock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>), as the unchangeable Refuge and Stronghold of his people, by which they are sustained, and to which they can resort for defense and protection at all times. The epithet is applied to God four times besides in this song (vers. 15, 18, 30, 31); it occurs also frequently in the Psalms (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2, 7</a>; etc.). The Hebrew word, <span class="accented">tsur</span>, <span class="accented">gut</span>, or <span class="accented">zur</span>, appears in several proper names of the Mosaic period, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Pedahzur</span>, "Rock delivers" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>), a name of the same import as <span class="accented">Pedahel</span>, "God delivers" (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-28.htm">Numbers 34:28</a>); <span class="accented">Elizur</span>, "God is a Rock" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5</a>); <span class="accented">Zuriel</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-35.htm">Numbers 3:35</a>) and <span class="accented">Zurishaddai</span>, "the Almighty is Rock" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-6.htm">Numbers 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>). "Jehovah," says Baumgarten, "is here called <span class="accented">Rock</span>, without any qualification, the reason is that he is the only true rock, and all the strength and firmness of earth's stones is but an ectype of his unchangeable faithfulness and rectitude. If one cleaves to the dualism of spirit and nature, and regards the figure as a merely subjective, arbitrary union of the two, such an expression is simply unintelligible; but if we would understand Scripture and religious speech, we must with all earnestness accustom ourselves to recognize the spiritual ground in nature, and apprehend this in the Biblical expression (comp. Steffens' 'Religionsphilosophie,' 1. s. 101, 102)." It is remarkable that none of the ancient versions have retained this epithet here. The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dens</span> ("Dei opera"); the Targum of Onkelos, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "Mighty;" while the Peshito has simply the pronoun "his" appended to "works," . <span class="cmt_word">For all his ways are judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. accordant with rectitude (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A God of truth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of faithfulness</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to stay, or be stayed, to be firm). <span class="cmt_word">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</span> Of this difficult passage the following seems the best construction and rendering: - <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">perverse and crooked generation not his children</span>, [but] <span class="accented">their spot - has become corrupt towards him</span>. The subject of the verb at the beginning of the verse is the "perverse and crooked generation," at the end of it, and between the verb and its subject there is interjected parenthetically the clause, "not his children, but their spot." <span class="accented">Spot</span> is here used in a moral sense, as in <a href="../../par/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>. These corrupt persons claimed to be children of God, but they were not; they were rather a stain and a reproach to them (cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). The rendering above given is substantially that of De Wette, Knobel, Keil, and Herxheimer, by all of whom the "perverse generation "is regarded as the subject of the sentence. This is the view adopted also in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' Some would make "God" the subject, and render, "He hath corrupted to him, or to himself" (margin, Authorized Version; Ibn Ezra, etc.). Others take "spot" as the subject, thus: "Their spot or blemish hath corrupted before him children not his" (Lowth, Dathe); but such renderings are forced, and proceed on constructions of the text which are illegitimate. Donaldson ('Jashar,' pp. 186, 223, edit. See.), following Lowth's construction, appeals to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (ver. 20) as a similar inversion. But the two cases are not parallel. To make them so, we must have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "his children in whom is no spot." Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as the noun here, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, and tracing it to the Syriac , <span class="accented">juravit</span>, renders "to him they, his not sons, have corrupted their oath," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. have broken it; and this Furst approves. But the phrase, "to corrupt an oath" is unexampled in the Old Testament, and there is no ground for changing the noun. The ancient versions vary considerably here: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>: Aq., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: Sym., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">peccaverunt ei et non filii ejus in sordibus</span>; Ver. Itala., <span class="accented">peeca verunt non ei filii maculati</span>; Syriac, "They corrupted but not him, children of defilement." These various renderings indicate that probably the text is and has long been corrupt. Some of the older English versions are worth noting on this verse. Rogers [Matthew], "The frowarde and overthwart generation hath marred them selves to himward, and are not his sonnes for their deformitie's sake;" Bishop's Bible, "Frowardly have they done agaynst him by their vices, not being his own children, but a wicked and froward generation;" Geneva Version, "They have corrupted themselves towards him by their vice, not  being his children, but a froward and crooked generation."

"Israel is figuratively represented as a man without food or water, and surrounded by howling, ferocious beasts, and who must needs have perished had not God found him and rescued him" (Herxheimer). <span class="cmt_word">The apple of his eye</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the mannikin</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of his eye, the pupil; so called because in it, as in a mirror, a person sees his own image reflected in miniature (Gesenius), or because, being the tenderest part of the eye, it is guarded as one would a babe (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>). By Delitzsch and others this explanation of the word is rejected as not philologically justified, there being no evidence that the termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> had a diminutive force; and as not in keeping with the earnestness of the passages in which this word occurs. They prefer the explanation <span class="accented">man image</span> to <span class="accented">mannikin</span>. Anyhow, the use of the word here must be taken as indicating that Israel is ever in the eye of the Lord, the object of his constant and tenderest care. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - God's treatment of his people is compared to that of an eagle towards its young (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>). In the Authorized Version, the apodosis of the sentence is made to begin at ver. 12, and ver. 11 is wholly understood of the eagle and its young. To this arrangement it has been objected that it overlooks the fact that the suffixes to the verbs "taketh" and "beareth" are singulars, and are to be understood consequently, not of the eaglets, but of Israel. It has, therefore, been proposed to render the passage thus: <span class="accented">As an eagle which stirreth up its nest</span>, <span class="accented">fluttereth over its young</span>, <span class="accented">he spread out his wings</span>, <span class="accented">took him up</span>, <span class="accented">and carried him on his pinions</span>. <span class="accented">The Lord alone did lead him</span>, etc. The comparison is thus made to pass into a metaphorical representation of the Lord's dealing with Israel. One feels that there is something violent in this, for whilst God's care for Israel might be fittingly <span class="accented">compared to</span> that of an eagle towards her young, it is less fit to speak of God himself as if he <span class="accented">were</span> an eagle with wings which he spread abroad and on which he bare Israel. The rendering in the Authorized Version is on this account to be preferred, if it can be grammatically vindicated. And this it may on the ground that the suffixes may be understood of the "nest" as containing the young ("continens pro contento," a common rhetorical trope in Scripture; see Glass., 'Philippians Sac.,' p. 686; cf. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:475, "nidisque loquacibus escam"); or the young may be referred to individually, "taketh it, beareth it," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. each of them; or, if the nest be understood, the whole body of them as therein contained. <span class="cmt_word">Stirreth up her</span> [its] <span class="cmt_word">nest</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. its nestlings; <span class="accented">provocans ad</span>  <span class="accented">volandum pullos suos</span>, <span class="accented">Vulgate</span>. This is the explanation usually given of the initial clause of this verse; but its accuracy has been questioned, Furst would render the verb by "watchesover; "but though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to watch, may have this meaning, it is undoubtedly used generally in the sense of rousing, exciting, stirring up. Knobel retains this meaning, but understands the clause of the exciting of the nestlings by the parent bird coming to them with food. This is certainly more in keeping with what follows; for when the eagle nestles or broods over her young, she does not excite them to fly. <span class="cmt_word">Fluttereth over her young</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broods over</span>, <span class="accented">nestles</span>, or <span class="accented">cherishes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Spreadeth abroad her wings,</span> etc. "I once saw a very interesting sight above one of the crags of Ben Nevis, as I was going in pursuit of black game. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of a mountain, in the eye of the sun; - it was about midday, and bright for this climate. They at first made small circles, and the young imitated them; they paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their first flight, holding them on their expanded wings when they appeared exhausted, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising towards the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight, so as to make a gradually ascending spiral" (Davy, 'Salinertia;' see also Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 2:181). The general reference is to God's fostering care of Israel, and especially his dealing with them when "he suffered their manners in the wilderness" (<a href="../../par/acts/13-18.htm">Acts 13:18</a>), disciplined them, and trained them for what they were appointed to do.

There is no ground for the explanation "fery wine" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing.

"By using the name <span class="accented">righteous</span> in place of <span class="accented">Israel</span>, Moses ironically censures those who had swerved from rectitude; by recalling to memory with what dignity they had been endowed, he the more sharply rebukes the perfidy which was their crime" (Calvin).

Besides, neither here nor in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> would a term of endearment be suitable. <span class="cmt_word">Waxed fat, and kicked</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>).

The "this" in ver. 34 is by some understood of the sinful doings of the Israelites which God should not forget or overlook. So the Targum of Onkelos: "Are not all their works manifest before me, kept against the day of judgment in my treasures?" So also Calvin, "<span class="accented">Quanquam</span> de poenis hunc versum quidam exponunt, acsi Deus assereret diversas earum species apud se paratas esse, quas depromat quoties libuerit: rectius tamen est de sceleribus intelligere."

Not only the deeds of the transgressors, but the judgments that should come on Israel, and also God's interposition on their behalf, <span class="accented">were laid up in store with him</span>, <span class="accented">and sealed up among his treasures</span>. All that had been done had been noted, and all that should happen was decreed, and should certainly come to pass. The "this' has thus both a retrospective and a prospective reference; it includes both the sin of the nation and God's dealing with them afterwards, as well as his judgments on their enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My treasures</span>.
