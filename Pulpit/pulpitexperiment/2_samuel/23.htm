David the son of Jesse said, and the man <i>who was</i> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now these be the last words of David.</span> A long interval separates this psalm from the preceding. The one was written when David had just reached the zenith of his power, and, when still unstained by foul crime, he could claim God's favour as due to his innocence. These last words were David's latest inspired utterance, written, probably, towards the end of the calm period which followed upon his restoration to his throne, and when time and the sense of God's renewed favour had healed the wounds of his soul. <span class="cmt_word">David the son of Jesse said.</span> It was probably this account of the author, and its personal character, which caused the exclusion of this hymn from the Book of Psalms. It seemed to belong rather to David's private history than to a collection made for use in the public services of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Said</span>. The word is one usually applied to a message coming directly from God. It is used, however, four times in <a href="../../par/numbers/24.htm">Numbers 24</a>. of the words of Balaam, and in <a href="../../par/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>. of those of Agur. The solemnity of the word indicates the fatness of its inspiration. <span class="cmt_word">The sweet psalmist;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he who is pleasant in the psalms of Israel.</span> David might well claim this title, as, under God, we owe the Psalter to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <i>was</i> in my tongue.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <i>must be</i> just, ruling in the fear of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that ruleth,</span> etc. This rendering of the Hebrew is very beautiful, and fit to be graven on the hearts of rulers. There is often almost an inspiration in the renderings of the Authorized Version. Grammatically, nevertheless, the psalm declares the blessedness of the king who is just, and may be translated as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"He that ruleth over men righteously,<br />That ruleth in the fear of God -<br />And as the morning light shall he be,<br />when the sun riseth,<br />A morning without clouds;<br />Yea, as the tender grass from the earth,<br />from sunshine, from rain."</span> A king who rules his people justly is as glorious as the sun rising in its strength to drive away the works of darkness, and give men, by precept and example, the light of clear knowledge of their duty. But the last metaphor is especially beautiful. In the summer, vegetation dries up under the burning heat of the sun; all is bare and brown, and a few withered stalks of the coarser plants alone remain. But when the rains come, followed by bright sunshine, nature at one burst flashes into beauty, and the hillsides and plains are covered with the soft green of the reviving grass, through which myriads of flowers soon push their way, and clothe the landscape with bright colours. So a just and upright government calls into being countless forms of human activity, and fosters all that is morally beautiful, while it checks the blighting influences of unregulated passion and selfish greed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>he shall be</i> as the light of the morning, <i>when</i> the sun riseth, <i>even</i> a morning without clouds; <i>as</i> the tender grass <i>springing</i> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Although my house <i>be</i> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <i>things</i>, and sure: for <i>this is</i> all my salvation, and all <i>my</i> desire, although he make <i>it</i> not to grow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Although my house,</span> etc. The rendering of the Authorized Version is that of the ancient versions, and is to be retained. David could not but feel that his house was too stained with sin upon sin for him to be able to lay claim to have been in fact that which the theocratic king was in theory, and which David ought to have been as the representative of Christ, and himself the christ, or anointed of Israel's God. But most modern commentators take the negatives as interrogative, and, therefore, as strong assertions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"For is not my house so with God?<br />For he had made with me an eternal covenant,<br />Ordered in all things, and secure:<br />For all my salvation and all my desire,<br />Shall he not make it to grow?"</span> But surely David had failed in realizing the better purposes of his heart, and it was of God's good pleasure that the covenant, in spite of personal failure, remained firm and secure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>the sons</i> of Belial <i>shall be</i> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - The sons of <span class="cmt_word">Belial;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">belial</span>; not a proper name, but a word signifying "worthlessness," and especially vicious worthlessness (see note on 1 Samuel 1:16). It is from this worthlessness that opposition arises to the just king, and he recognizes it as that which thwarts his efforts. The words may be rendered ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"But the ungodly are as thorns, to be all of them thrust away;<br />For they may not be taken hold of with the hand.<br />And the man that would touch them<br />Must arm himself with iron and the staff of a spear;<br />And they shall be utterly burned with fire unto nothingness."</span> The vicious worthlessness which opposes righteous government must be treated like thorns, too prickly and sharp pointed for gentle dealing. They must be torn up by an iron hook fixed to the end of a spear-handle, and then burnt. The word translated <span class="cmt_word">in the same place</span> in the Authorized Version is rendered by Jerome "even to nothing;" and it is just the sort of phrase for which his authority is greatest; for he went to Palestine, and remained there several years, to study the language under Hebrew teachers on the spot. The Septuagint must have had a different reading, as it translates "their shame." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-7.htm">2 Samuel 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">But the man <i>that</i> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <i>same</i> place.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>be</i> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <i>was</i> Adino the Eznite: <i>he lift up his spear</i> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These be the names.</span> A similar list is given in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-47</a>, with several variations, and sixteen more names. It is given there in connection with David's elevation to the throne of all Israel, and the conquest of Jerusalem. Such catalogues might possibly be revised from time to time, and new names inserted as there were vacancies caused by death. And this seems to have been the case with the list in Chronicles, which contains the names of all who were admitted during David's reign into the order of the mighties. The present is the actual list of the order as it existed on the day when David, at Hebron, was anointed king over all the twelve tribes. And we can well conceive that, on so grand an occasion, David founded this, the first order of chivalry, and gave his thirty knights, as they would be now called, their special rank and high privileges. <span class="cmt_word">The Tachmonite.</span> This verse is extremely corrupt. A man could not be a Tachmonite and an Eznite at the same time. In the Revised Version the corruption is confessed in the mildest terms, but there is something painfully ludicrous in giving Josheb-basshebeth as the man's name. The reading "Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite," in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-6.htm">1 Chronicles 12:6</a>, where Jashobeam is mentioned among those who joined David at Ziklag, and by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>, where we find him appointed commander of the first brigade of twenty-four thousand men. The error in the present text arose from the scribe's eye being misled by catching sight of <span class="accented">basshebeth</span> in the line above, it being the word translated "in the same place" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">He Adino the Eznite.</span> These unmeaning words are a corruption of the right reading preserved in Chronicles, "he lifted up his spear." The number of men whom he slew at one time is there stated as having been three hundred; but, as Abishai accomplished this feat, and yet held only inferior rank, eight hundred is probably right. And possibly it is not meant that he slew them all with his own hand, though that is quite possible. He was <span class="cmt_word">chief of the captains.</span> The word for "captain," <span class="accented">shalish</span>, is derived from the numeral "three;" and probably it was the title of the three who formed the first rank of the mighties. But in course of time it seems to have been applied to the commanders of the body guard (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>); and we find Bidcar so styled when in personal attendance upon Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>); and Pekah used the opportunities afforded by this office for the murder of Pekahiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). It is not used of military officers generally. Those admitted to the list were evidently the outlaws . who had been with David in his wanderings and at Ziklag. They now received their reward, and became, moreover, the stay of David's throne. It is their past history which accounts for the strange composition of the list. A large number came from Judah, and especially from Bethlehem. Several are David's own relatives. Seven towns or families furnish sixteen out of the whole list. We find a father and his son, and pairs of brothers. There are, moreover, numerous foreigners - Hittites, Ammonites, Moabites, a Syrian from Zobah, and Gideonites, descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Such a list would have been sorely resented had it not been formed out of men who had earned it by their past services and their fidelity to David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <i>one</i> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <i>that</i> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dodo</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and "Dodo" is a mere correction of the Massorites to bring the name into verbal agreement with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>; but in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a> he is called <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and we  there find him in command of the second division of the army. For "Dodai," however, we ought to read there "Eleazar the son of Dodai." <span class="cmt_word">Ahohite</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">the son of an Ahohite</span>, and probably a member of the family descended from Ahoah, a son of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-4.htm">1 Chronicles 8:4</a>). He would thus belong to the most warlike tribe of Israel, though not mentioned among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7</a>). He joined him, apparently, at an earlier date. That <span class="cmt_word">were there gathered together.</span> The word "there" implies the previous mention of some place, and though the text in the parallel passage in Chronicles is more corrupt than that before us, it has, nevertheless, preserved the name of the spot where the encounter took place. In Chronicles the name of Shammah is omitted, and his achievement is mixed up in a strange fashion with that of Eleazar. Here the two heroes have each his separate record, and it is only on minor matters that the text there is more correct. Restored from the readings in Chronicles, the narrative is as follows: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up: and he stood (that is, made a stand) and smote," etc. <span class="accented">Pas-dammim</span> is called <span class="accented">Ephes-dammim</span> in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. It was situated in the valley of Elah, and, as being upon the border, was the scene of numerous conflicts, whence its name, "the boundary of blood." It was there that David slew Goliath. <span class="cmt_word">Were gone away;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">went up</span>; that is, to battle. The idea that the Israelites had fled is taken from the parallel place in Chronicles, where, however, it refers to Shammah's exploit. In vers. 9 and 11 there, the phrase, "the Philistines were gathered together," occurs twice, and the scribe, having accidentally omitted the intervening words, has confused together the exploits of Eleazar and Shammah. In this battle Eleazar withstood the Philistine onset, and smote them till his hand clave to his sword hilt. Many such instances of cramp are recorded, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, in his commentary, quotes one in which the muscles of a warrior's hand could be relaxed, after hard fighting, only by fomentations of hot water. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-10.htm">2 Samuel 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Victory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">salvation</span>; and so also in ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Returned after him.</span> This does not imply that they had fled, but simply that they turned in whichever way he turned, and followed him. Battles in old time depended very much upon the prowess of the leaders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a></div><div class="verse">And after him <i>was</i> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.

The word is rare, but occurs again in ver. 13, where, however, we find in Chronicles the ordinary name for a <span class="accented">host</span> substituted for it. The Revisers have retained in the margin, "or, for foraging:" but its occurrence in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a>, where it is tendered "thy congregation," and in the margin of the Revised Version," troop" makes it probable that" troop" is the right rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Lentiles</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>, "barley." The difference is probably caused by a transposition of letters. The Philistines seem to have made this incursion in order to carry off or destroy the crops of the Israelites.

The absence of the article shows that these three were not Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah, but probably Abishai, Be-naiah, and another whose name and exploits have been purposely omitted both here and in Chronicles. Apparently this narrative, so interesting as showing the fascination which David exercised over his men, is given as having led to the institution of this second order of three in the brotherhood of the mighties. <span class="cmt_word">In the harvest time.</span> The Hebrew is "to harvest," but in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15</a> "to the rock." As the preposition used here cannot mean "in," this is probably the right reading. In this case, also, it is the similarity of the words that has led to the con. fusion. Is it possible that these lists were taken from very old and worn catalogues, which it was very difficult to decipher? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-14.htm">2 Samuel 23:14</a></div><div class="verse">And David <i>was</i> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <i>was</i> then <i>in</i> Bethlehem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hold;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the hold.</span> The definite article here and in ch. 5:17, and the mention of the Philistines as being in the valley of Rephaim, seem to indicate that David had abandoned Jerusalem upon the invasion of the Philistines, and sought refuge at Adullam (see note on 2 Samuel 5:17). In its neighbourhood is an isolated hill, on which, probably, was a frontier fortress, in which David prepared to defend himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a></div><div class="verse">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which <i>is</i> by the gate!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate.</span> Bethlehem is now supplied with water by an aqueduct, and the wells close to the town have ceased to exist. The cistern of "deep, clear, cool water," descsribed by Ritter, in his 'Geography of Palestine,' and now called David's Well, is three quarters of a mile to the north of Bethlehem, and too distant to be that which David meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-16.htm">2 Samuel 23:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brake through the host</span> (or, <span class="accented">camp</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the Philistines.</span> The Philistine camp was pitched in the valley of Rephaim, and to reach Bethlehem, which was more than twenty or twenty-five miles distant, these three heroes must pass close to the ground occupied by the enemy. The valley of Rephaim, in fact, extended from Jerusalem  to Bethlehem, and, to guard their position, the Philistines held Bethlehem with a strong garrison. Of course the heroes would use every precaution; for to be discovered would be certain death. The story of their perils and presence of mind in danger, and hairbreadth escape, would be full of interest; but we are told only that they succeeded, and returned in safety, bearing their precious burden; but David would not drink, <span class="cmt_word">and poured it out unto Jehovah.</span> The word is that used of a sacrificial libation; for David regarded it as holy, and consecrated to God, because it had been bought with blood - at the risk, that is, of the lives of these gallant men. Nothing is recorded in the romances of the Middle Ages, when knightly chivalry was at its height, more gallant and noble than the exploit of these men. And the very essence of its devotion lay in the fact that it was done to gratify a mere sick longing, and therefore out of pure love. Sick, no doubt, David was, and burning with fever; and even more depressed by the apparent hopelessness of his position. The exploit changed the course of his thoughts. What could he not do with such heroes! Though racked during their absence with anxiety and self-reproach, yet on their return he would be dispirited no longer, but filled with confidence. The words, "Shall I drink?" inserted in the Revised Version, have apparently dropped out of the text by accident. They are found in the parallel place in Chronicles, and in the Septuagint and Vulgate here. The Syriac has, "At the peril of their life's blood these men went."

Abishai, by reason of this exploit, became "chief of the three;" that is, of the second order of three established in the fraternity of the mighties. At the end of the verse, and in ver. 19, the Authorized Version strangely puts the article where it is absent in the Hebrew, and omits it where it is present. The right rendering and meaning is, "He had a name, that is, rank, reputation, among the three. Was he not the most honourable of the three? For this he was made their captain: yet he attained not to equal dignity with the first three."

The meaning of the description given of him there is disputed; but probably it should be translated, "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest, as head," that is, of the brigade. He was thus the son of the Jehoiada who was leader of the house of Aaron, and whose coming to Hebron with three thousand seven hundred martial priests did so much to make David king of all Israel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>).

The Syriac supports the Authorized Version in understanding by the term "heroes," or "champions;" but the use of poetical language in a prosaic catalogue is so strange that the Septuagint is probably right. If so, Ariel is the proper name of the King of Moab and the achievement took place in the war recorded in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A lion.</span> This achievement would be as gratefully remembered as the killing of a man eating tiger by the natives in India. A lion, driven by the cold from the forests, had made its lair in a dry tank near some town, and thence preyed upon the inhabitants as they went in and out of the city. And Benaiah had pity upon them, and came to the rescue, and went down into the pit, and, at the risk of his life, slew the lion.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a></div><div class="verse">Asahel the brother of Joab <i>was</i> one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thirty.</span> This order of knighthood consisted originally of thirty-three men, of whom three were of higher rank, and presided, probably, each over ten, while Joab was chief over them all. This arrangement of men in tens, with an officer over them. was, in fact, the normal rule among the Hebrews. The second triad is  unusual, but is explained by the history. In honour of the exploit of bringing the water from the well of Bethlehem, this second order of three was instituted, lower than the three chiefs, but higher than the rest. The third of these is not mentioned, and the disappearance of the name is not the result of accident, but of purpose. Had it been a scribe's error, there would have been some trace of it in the versions. But if the name was erased, it must have been blotted out for treason, and we thus have two candidates for the vacant niche: one is Amasa, and the other Ahithophel. The name of Joab we cannot for one moment admit. He never was a traitor to David, nor would the latter, though king, have ventured to degrade one so powerful, and who continued to be commander-in-chief until David's death. Now, if Amasa is the same as the Amasai in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>, who was chief of the captains who came from Judah and Benjamin to David when he was in the hold, it is difficult to account for the absence of his name from the list of the thirty. Plainly, however, David did not regard his treason with strong displeasure, but was prepared, after Absalom's death, to make him commander-in-chief. But we must remember that a place in this second triad was gained by one exploit. The three were those who broke through the Philistine host, and fetched the water from Bethlehem. Such a deed would account for the close attachment between David and Ahithophel. He was the king's companion, and his familiar friend. It would account also for his suicide. His love to David had, for some unknown reason, turned to bitter hatred. He sought, not only David's life, but his dishonour. His feelings must have been highly excited before he could have worked himself up to such a pitch; and the reaction and disappointment would be equally extreme. He never could have faced David again, remembering the warmth of former love, and the shamelessness with which he had sought, not only his life, but to bring upon him public shame and ignominy. And his name would have been totally erased, and gone down into silence. Of Ahithophel's personal accomplishments as a brave warrior, we cannot doubt (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>), and his son Eliam was one of the mighties. (On a son and father both belonging to the order, see note on ver. 33.) <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan</span> (see note on 2 Samuel 21:19).
