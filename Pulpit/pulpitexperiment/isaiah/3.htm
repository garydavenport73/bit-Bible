The general denunciations against Israel of the two preceding chapters are here turned especially against Jerusalem. God will deprive her of all her superior and more honorable classes (vers. 1-3); and will give her "children" for her rulers (ver. 4). There will be continued oppression, and the rise of an insolent and undutiful spirit (ver. 5). Those fit to bear rule will refuse to do so (vers. 6, 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, the Lord of hosts</span> (see note on Isaiah 1:24). <span class="cmt_word">The stay and the staff</span>; rather, <span class="accented">stay and staff</span>. Neither word has the article. The latter is the feminine form of the former; and the intention is to announce that all support of every kind is about to be withdrawn. <span class="cmt_word">The whole stay of bread... of water.</span> Mr. Cheyne agrees with Hitzig and Knobel that this clause is probably a gloss on the text, subsequently introduced into it, and a gloss which (lid not proceed from a very enlightened commentator. The "stay" and "staff" intended are certainly not, literal "bread" and "water," but the powerful and respectable classes enumerated in the two following verses. If the words are Isaiah's, he must have intended them to be taken metaphorically.

The extreme youth of the later kings of Judah at the date of their accession is very remarkable. After Hezekiah, only one was as much as twenty-five years old when he came to the throne.

Hypocrisy has been said to be the homage that vice pays to virtue.

The mention of the fact that the men of Jerusalem have permanently injured their moral natures by sin, and thus "rewarded evil to themselves," leads the prophet to declare at this point, parenthetically, the general law, which extends alike to the evil and the good - that men receive in themselves the recompense of their deeds. The righteous raise their moral nature, become better, and, in becoming better, become happier. "It is well with them, for of the fruit of their doings they eat." The wicked deprave and corrupt themselves, lower their moral nature, become worse than they were, and, in becoming worse, become more miserable.

Here the emphatic words are "children," "women." <span class="cmt_word">Children</span> (see ver. 4). The rulers are "children," or rather "babes" - foolish, capricious, cowardly.

In noticing this, the prophet, to give more weight to his denunciation, introduces Jehovah as standing up, and coming forward on the popular side, to plead the people's cause, and remonstrate with their oppressors. There is great force in this sudden entrance on the scene of Jehovah himself, as Pleader and Judge. <span class="cmt_word">And... judge the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the peoples</span>.

The Egyptian remains show an advanced state of luxury among the women at a time anterior to Moses; and in Assyria, though the evidence is less abundant, we find also indications of a similar kind. The Jews, whose regard for their women was high, are not likely to have been behindhand in the gallantry which shows itself in heaping ornament and the newest appliances of civilization on the weaker sex.

Anklets were worn by the Egyptian women from the time of the twelfth dynasty (about  <span class="date">B.C. 1900</span>). They were, in general, plain rings of metal, but appear to have been sometimes set with precious stones (see Lepsius, 'Denkmaler,' pt. 2. pls. 128, 129). No bells appear attached to any; but bells were known in Assyria from the time of Sennacherib ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 417, 2nd edit.). Their cauls; margin, <span class="accented">networks</span>. The marginal rendering is probably correct (comp. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). Network caps to contain the hair seem to be intended (so Kimchi, Saadiah, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kay). Mr. Cheyne prefers "wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other." <span class="cmt_word">Round tires like the moon; rather, crescents</span>. Flat ornaments in metal, like a young moon, generally worn suspended round the neck (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, where the same word occurs).

Earrings were worn from very ancient times by both the Assyrians and the Egyptians. The ring had frequently a pendant hanging from it. Men wore armlets in Assyria, and both men and women in Egypt (Lepsius, 'Denktamer,' pt. 3. pl. 1). Veils have always been regarded in the East as almost a necessary part of female attire.

It is quite uncertain what this was, since we have no representations of Hebrew women. Egyptian women commonly wore a mere fillet with pendant ends. The Hebrew word here employed is used in Exodus of the head-dress of the priests (Exodus 39:28). The ornaments of the legs. These are explained as chains connecting the two anklets together. The head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; rather, <span class="accented">the girdles</span>, <span class="accented">and the scent-bottles</span>, <span class="accented">and the amulets</span>. Scent-bottles and jars for holding sweet-smelling unguents are among the most frequent toilette articles recovered from Egyptian tombs and Assyrian palaces. Amulets have been worn in the East from very ancient times, and are still trusted in as much as ever. They frequently take the form of ornaments.

Such were known in Egypt from the time of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), and probably earlier. It would seem from the present passage that their use was not confined to men. <span class="cmt_word">Nose-jewels.</span>  Actual nose-rings are not represented in any of the ancient remains; and the use of them seems to be confined to very barbarous communities. Probably the "nose-jewels" here mentioned were ornaments depending from the forehead and touching the upper part of the nose,

An inner and an outer tunic or petticoat were commonly worn by females of the higher class in the East. The inner tunic was a simple linen vest; but the outer was generally of a better material, and richly ornamented. Outside this, a sort of wrap, or cloak, was worn occasionally (see <a href="../../par/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). Purses were, no doubt, carried by wealthy persons of both sexes; but their mention in this list does not seem very appropriate. Perhaps toilet-bags of some kind or other are intended (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>).

In ancient times these were not made of glass, but of some metal which took a high polish. Most commonly, the material seems to have been bronze. Many such mirrors have been found in Egypt, a few in Assyria, in Etruria a considerable number. They are of small size, intended to be carried in the hand, and have for that purpose a metal or a wooden handle, which is sometimes highly artistic. <span class="cmt_word">The fine linen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the muslin robes</span>. <span class="accented">Sedin</span>, the Hebrew word used, is probably a corruption or analogue of <span class="accented">sin-</span>don, the Greek name for Indian fabrics. It is only used here and in <a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The hoods, and the vails</span>; or, <span class="accented">the turbans and the scarfs</span>. The word translated" hood" is nearly the same as that which designates the head-dress of the high priest in Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 37, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>, etc.) and Leviticus (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-9.htm">Leviticus 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), which seems to have been a "turban" (see note on Exodus 28:4). The other word, here translated "vail," occurs only in this place and <a href="../../par/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>. Its exact meaning is uncertain; but it can scarcely be a veil; since "veils" have been already mentioned (ver. 19).

The word used occurs only in this place. <span class="cmt_word">Instead of well-set hair baldness</span> (compare above, ver. 17). By "well-set hair" seems to be meant "hair arranged with such exactness and order as to look like a work of art." The exact arrangement of the hair is very remarkable, both in the Egyptian and the Assyrian sculptures. Instead of such elaborate attempts to improve their looks, the daughters of Jerusalem would soon pluck their hair out by the roots, or shave it off, in mourning. <span class="cmt_word">A girding of sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>, etc.; and for the adoption of the custom by women, see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Burning instead of beauty</span>. This meaning is now generally acknowledged, the sense of "burning" being borne out by the cognate verb used in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-28.htm">Proverbs 6:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, and the cognate noun used in <a href="../../par/exodus/21-25.htm">Exodus 21:25</a>. The" burning" intended is probably branding by a barbarous enemy (see Herod., 7:233; 'Hist. Tamerlau.,' p. 320).
