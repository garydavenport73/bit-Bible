Israel, being about to return from the Captivity, had the design of rebuilding the temple and re-establishing the temple worship. God rebukes this design in persons devoid of any spirit of holiness, and warns them that mere formal outward worship is an abomination to him (vers. 1-3). In ver. 4 he threatens them with punishment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>). The Hebrews, while they earnestly desired to have a material emblem of the presence of God in their midst, were deeply impressed with the feeling that no temple could be worthy of him, or other than most unworthy. "Will God," said Solomon, "indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). And again, "Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before trim?" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>). Thus Isaiah's note of warning was no novelty, and might rind responsive echoes in the hearts of many. <span class="cmt_word">Where is the house that ye build unto me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what manner of house is it that ye would build to me</span>, <span class="accented">add what manner of place for my rest</span>? God needs no "house;" and they cannot build him a house that could be in any way worthy of him. <span class="accented">They</span>, moreover, are unworthy to build him any house, which is the real ground of the refusal. There was no refusal, when the better part of the exiles, having returned, took the building in hand (see <a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8-14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, etc.).

Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord," etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">As if he out off a dog's neck</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog." (On the uncleanness of the dog, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He that offereth an oblation</span>; or, a meat <span class="accented">offering</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that burneth incense</span>. With his meat offering, as directed in <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 2</a>. Such a one is no better than he that blesseth (i.e. worships) an idol. It may be suspected that the ritual acts selected for comparison with those of the Levitical law are practices to which the exiles were given (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have chosen</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">as they haw chosen.</span> The clause stands over against the first clause of ver. 4, "As they (<span class="accented">gain hemmah</span>) have chosen their ways, so I (<span class="accented">gain ani</span>) have chosen their delusions." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a></div><div class="verse">I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose <i>that</i> in which I delighted not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their delusions</span>; or, <span class="accented">their childish follies</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). As God sends on some men "strong delusion that they   should believe a lie" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>), so on others he sends a spirit of childish folly, which makes their conduct silly and headstrong.

The scoffs which have long greeted those who believed God's promises and expected the restoration of Zion, will be put to shame. The silence in which Zion has lain will be broken; she will be once more a city "full of stirs, a tumultuous city" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>). Suddenly, without any pains of travail, she will bring forth; and her offspring will be "a nation born at once" (ver. 8). The godly exiles are called upon to rejoice at the prospect (ver. 10), and promised peace and comfort in the restored city (vers. 11-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear...  ye that tremble</span>.

The "city" and "temple" are suddenly in existence - they have sprung into being.

The occupation of Jerusalem by the great body of the returned exiles (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>) is intended. Such a second birth of a nation was strange, and without precedent (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?</span> rather, can <span class="accented">a land be brought forth in one day</span>?

In the former times Assyria had swept over Israel like an overwhelming flood to destroy her (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7, 8</a>); now the glory of the whole Gentile world should similarly overflow and overwhelm, but only to enrich and exalt. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be borne upon her</span> <span class="cmt_word">sides</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 9:4).

A signal outpouring of God's vengeance upon his enemies precedes the settlement of the Church in its final glorious condition, both in Isaiah and in the Revelation of St. John (see ch. 34, 35, and <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19-21</a>.). The wicked have to be removed before the righteous can be established in peace. Here the agencies employed against the wicked are "fire" and "sword"  -  fire pointing (as Delitzsch remarks) to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. God himself is represented as guiding and directing both agencies, to the punishment of the ungodly and the relief of those who trust in him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord will come with</span> <span class="cmt_word">fire.</span> "Fire" is a usual accompaniment of a "theophany." God descended on Sinai "in fire" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), and led the Israelites through the wilderness by the pillar of the cloud and of fire (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), and filled the tabernacle with a glory as of fire (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>), and "answered David from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), and in the same way answered Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). Isaiah almost always describes a theophany as a "coming with fire" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12, 14</a>, etc.). The agency of fire in the judgment that will overtake the wicked simultaneously with Christ's second coming, appears in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7-10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With his</span> <span class="cmt_word">chariots</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>). "Chariots," in the plural, may be regarded as symbolizing the "hosts" of natural and supernatural forces that God has at his command (Cheyne). Like a whirlwind. The whirring of the wheels of chariots, their noise, the swiftness of their pace, and the destruction that they cause, make this simile most appropriate.

Behind one tree in the midst; literally, <span class="accented">behind one in the midst.</span> It seems quite impossible that "one" can mean "one tree," when no tree has been mentioned, and gardens do not necessarily contain trees. The marginal rendering, "one after another," is also impossible. The "one in the midst" must have been either a hierophant who directed the ceremonies (Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Delitzsch), or an image of a deity (Scaliger, Voss, Grotius, Lagarde, Cheyne). In the latter case, we must suppose that the worshippers had a scruple about mentioning the deity's name, and were accustomed to call him "one," or "a certain one" (comp. Herod., 2:171). Isaiah adopts their usage. <span class="cmt_word">Eating swine's</span> <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). And the abomination.

Probably the jerboa (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a></div><div class="verse">For I <i>know</i> their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know their works</span>. There is no verb in the Hebrew text, from which something has evidently fallen out. Mr. Cheyne supplies, "I will punish;" Gratz, "I have seen." "I know" is supported by the Targums, the Syriac Version, several manuscripts of the Septuagint, and the authorities of Saadiya, Vitringa, and Gesenius. And their thoughts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I know, not only their works, but even the thoughts from which the works proceeded. It shall some; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the time shall come." (For the full phrase, see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-7.htm">Ezekiel 7:7, 12</a>.) All nations and tongues. This expression has been corn-pared with Daniel's "kindreds and nations and languages" (<a href="../../par/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4, 7, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>, etc.), and has been regarded as a sign of late authorship. But "nations' and "tongues" are coupled together in Scripture as early as Genesis (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall come, and see my glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "see the glory that I shall get me upon my enemies" (vers. 15-17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a></div><div class="verse">And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <i>to</i> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <i>to</i> Tubal, and Javan, <i>to</i> the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-24.</span> - THE FINAL CONDITION OF THE CHURCH OF THE REDEEMED ON EARTH. When the enemies of God have been consumed, there shall go out from the Church missionaries, who shall convert the distant Gentiles, and unite them, and the Jews who dwell among them, into a single body of   worshippers, which shall inhabit the new Jerusalem on equal terms, and join continually in a common worship of Jehovah. The awful destruction of the wicked, and their eternal sufferings, shall at the same time be held in remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">I will set a sign among them.</span> Dr. Kay suggests that the "sign" is the resurrection of our Lord, or possibly a miraculous manifestation of Christ which is to precede his coming in judgment. Mr. Cheyne, less venturesome, finds in the prophet's words merely a suggestion of "some mysterious event, which he leaves his awestruck readers to imagine." <span class="cmt_word">Those that escape of them</span>. Not, surely, those of God's enemies that survive the slaughter, but "the remnant" of Jews, that are not among God's enemies, and so "escape." These shall be sent (as missionaries) to the distant nations; not literally to those enumerated, but to such as at the end of the world occupy a position which the nations mentioned occupied on Isaiah's horizon. Of these nations, Tarshish (Tartessus) was at the furthest limit westward, Pul and Lud, or rather Phut and Lud, at the furthest limit southward, Tubal and Javan at the furthest limit northward, Pul, which occurs nowhere else in Scripture as a geographic name, is almost certainly a wrong reading for Phut, which occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, and also three times (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>) in connection with Lud. Phut designates an African nation, probably the Nubians, whom the Egyptians called Pet, and who were noted as bowmen. Wetstein's conjecture of "Pun" (Punici, 'Phoenicians '), commended by Mr. Cheyne, is quite unsupported and highly improbable. Lud. It is tempting to connect "Lud" with the Lydians, who were certainly known as "<span class="accented">Lndi"</span> to the Assyrians of the time of Asshur-bani-pal (B.C. 669-626). But the other scriptural notices of "Lud" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), which uniformly connect it with Phut, point rather to an African people. See also <a href="../../par/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>, where the Ludim are a subdivision of the Egyptians. <span class="cmt_word">That draw the bow</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>). To <span class="cmt_word">Tubal</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>. Tubal stands, no doubt, for the Tibareni, a people of the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, called <span class="accented">Tuplai</span> or <span class="accented">Tabali</span> by the Assyrians. They would occupy Isaiah's northern and north-western horizon, in company with Javan, or the Ionians (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), who were among the chief people of Asia Minor. Javan, Tubal, and Mesheeh (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Muskai) are joined in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The isles</span> <span class="cmt_word">afar off</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shores and islands of the Mediterranean. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall bring all your brethren <i>for</i> an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall bring all</span> <span class="cmt_word">your brethren for an offering unto the Lord.</span> When the distant Gentiles have been converted, they shall bring to Christ the Jews of the dispersion, who dwell with them in the remote parts of the earth (comp. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-10.htm">Zephaniah 3:10</a>). Upon horses. The "new Jerusalem" being localized, the converts from the distant regions are represented as journeying from their own lands to the "holy mountain," and bringing the Jewish exiles with them by various methods of conveyance - upon horses, mules, and dromedaries, in chariots, and finally in palanquins or litters. "Litters" were used by the great men among the Egyptians from a very early date (see Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 93, fig. 2; Wilkinson, ' Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. p. 208). They were also employed by the Persians (Herod., 3:146) and by the later Romans. As the children of Israel bring an offering; rather, <span class="accented">bring the meat offering.</span> The existence of the temple, and the continuance of the Levitical rites at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, are clearly implied. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a></div><div class="verse">And I will also take of them for priests <i>and</i> for Levites, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will also take of them for priests and</span> <span class="cmt_word">for Levites;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and I will also take of them unto the priests and unto the Levites</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will add to the existing body of priests and Levites, who are pro-sumably Jews, fresh members from the newly converted Gentiles. The existence of a sacerdotal order, with distinctions of ranks, in the Church of the redeemed, is implied, and the gracious declaration is made that the privilege of furnishing members to both ranks of the order shall be conferred upon the Gentile proselytes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a></div><div class="verse">For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain</span>. The "new heavens and the new earth," once created, continue for ever (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1-27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1-5</a><span class="cmt_word">). So shall your seed and your name remain.</span> This statement is usually taken to be a promise of some special pre-eminence to the Jew over the Gentile in the final kingdom of the redeemed. But St. Paul speaks of all such privileges as already abolished in his day (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>); and, if the priesthood is to be common to both Gentile and Jew, the principle of equality would seem to be conceded. Perhaps no more is here meant than that, as the "new heaven and new earth" will always remain, so there will always remain a seed of true believers to worship God in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">From one new moon to another, and from</span> <span class="cmt_word">one sabbath to another</span>. Not that "new moons" and "sabbaths" will continue to be observed, for "new moons" have already lapsed, and "sabbaths" too will lapse when life is one perpetual sabbath passed in the worship of God. The phrase, used by the prophet is intended to express   absolute continuance without an interval. <span class="cmt_word">Shall all</span> <span class="cmt_word">flesh come to worship before me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/65-2.htm">Psalm 65:2</a>). The prophet still uses habitual modes of expression, though speaking of a time and circumstances to which they are no longer appropriate. "The literal meaning," as Dr. Pusey says ('Prophecy of Jesus,' p. 39), "was physically impossible." "All flesh," in all regions of the "new earth," could not worship in one spot, "and so it was plain that Isaiah spoke of a worship other than that at any given place"  - of a worship such as that whereof our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father" (<a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases</span>, etc. Here is more imagery, which it is impossible to understand literally. The carcases could not remain always to be looked at, nor while they remained could the sight of them be otherwise than loathsome to God's redeemed saints. Again, they could not be at the same time burnt with fire and eaten by worms. "The prophet, by the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility of our conceiving of the thing set forth as realized in any material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state, but <span class="accented">in figures</span> drawn from the present world" (Delitzsch). Does he mean more than this - that the redeemed shall have in their thoughts, at any rate from time to time, the fact that, while they have by God's great mercy been saved and brought into His  kingdom, there are those who have not been saved, but lie for ever under the awful sentence of God's wrath? This is a knowledge which the redeemed must have, and which may well produce a salutary effect on them, intensifying their gratitude and maintaining in them a spirit of reverent fear<span class="cmt_word">. Their worm shall not die, neither shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">their fire be quenched</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44, 46, 48</a>). It cannot be by chance that the evangelical prophet concludes his glorious prophecy with this terrible note of warning. Either he was divinely directed thus to terminate his teaching, or he felt the need that there was of his emphasizing all the many warnings dispersed throughout his "book" by a final, never-to-be-forgotten picture. The undying worm and the quenchless fire - images introduced by him - became appropriated thenceforth to the final condition of impenitent sinners (Jud. 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17), and were even adopted by our Lord himself in the same connection (<a href="../../par/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>.). The incongruity of the two images shows that they are not to be understood literally; but both alike imply everlasting continuance, and are incompatible with either of the two modern heresies of universalism or annihilationism. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, where the word <span class="accented">deraon</span> is rendered "contempt"). The Jewish rabbis regarded it as anomalous that any portion of Scripture should conclude with words of ill omen. When, therefore, this chapter was read in the synagogue, or the last of Ecclesiastes, or Lamentations, or Malachi, they directed that after the reading of the last verse, the last verse but one should he repeated, to correct the sad impression that would otherwise have been left upon the mind. But Isaiah thought it salutary to leave this sad impression (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/65.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 65"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 65" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
