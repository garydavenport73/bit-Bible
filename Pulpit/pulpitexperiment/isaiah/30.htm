The word translated "rebellious" is used in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18, 20</a> of the persistently disobedient son, who was to be brought before the elders and stoned to death. <span class="cmt_word">That take counsel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that form plans</span>, such as the plan now formed to call in the aid of Egypt. It must be borne in mind that, under the theocracy, there was an authorized mode of consulting God, and receiving an answer from him, in any political emergency. <span class="cmt_word">That cover with a covering.</span> The exact metaphor employed is uncertain, Mr. Cheyne renders, "that weave a web;" Dr. Kay, "that pour out a molten image." The meaning, however, in any case is, "that carry out a design," the clause being a mere variant of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">That they may add sin to sin</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to add a fresh sin to all their former sins."

Either the Jewish ambassadors have already started, or the anticipatory vision of the prophet sees them as if starting. In the history (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1-22</a>) it is not expressly said that Hezekiah made application to Egypt for aid; but the reproaches of Rabshakeh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21, 24</a>) would be pointless if he had not done so. <span class="cmt_word">Have not asked at my mouth</span>. As they ought to have done (see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh</span>. It is very uncertain who is the "Pharaoh" here intended. The supreme power over Egypt was probably, at the time, in the hands of Tirkakah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9</a>); but Lower Egypt seems to have been ruled by various princes, the chief of whom was Shabatok, and any one of these may have been regarded by Isaiah as a "Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">To trust in the shadow of Egypt.</span> Trust in the "shadow of God" was an expression very familiar to the Jews (see <a href="../../par/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>). To "trust in the shadow of Egypt" was to put Egypt in the place of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt <i>your</i> confusion.</div><div class="comm">

"Zoan" is undoubtedly Tanis, which is now "San," a heap of ruins in the Delta, where some interesting remains of the shepherd-kings have been discovered. It was a favorite capital of the monarchs of the nineteenth dynasty, and seems to have been the scene of the struggle between Moses and the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12, 43</a>). It then declined, but is said to have been the birthplace of the first king of the twenty-first dynasty. In the Ethiopian period it rose once more to some importance, and was at one time the capital of a principality (see G. Smith's 'Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 21, 26, 32). The "<span class="accented">princes"</span> here spoken of are probably Hezekiah's ambassadors. <span class="cmt_word">His ambassadors came to Hanes</span>. "Hanes" has been generally identified with the modern Esnes, a village between Memphis and Thebes, which is thought to mark the site of Hera-cleopolis Magna. But it has been well remarked that the Jewish envoys would scarcely have proceeded so far. Mr. R.S. Peele suggests, instead of Esnes, Tahpenes, or Daphnae ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 753); but that name is somewhat remote from Hanes. Perhaps it would be best to acknowledge that "Hanes" cannot at present be identified. It was probably not very far from Tanis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a></div><div class="verse">They were all ashamed of a people <i>that</i> could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were all ashamed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all are ashamed</span>. The reference is not to the ambassadors, who felt no shame in their embassy, and probably returned elated by the promises made them; but to the subsequent feelings of the Jewish nation, when it was discovered by sad experience that no reliance was to be placed on "the strength of Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">A people that could not profit</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. Mr. Cheyne compares, very pertinently, an inscription of Sargon's, where he says of the people of Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, that "they and their evil chiefs, to fight against me, unto Pharaoh, King of Egypt, <span class="accented">a monarch who could not save them</span>, their presents carried, and besought his alliance" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130, II. 35-39). Egypt was, in fact, quite unable to cope with Assyria, and knew it. <span class="cmt_word">A shame, and also a reproach</span>. A matter of which they would themselves be "ashamed," and with which the Assyrians would "reproach" them (as they did, <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21, 24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a></div><div class="verse">The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence <i>come</i> the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people <i>that</i> shall not profit <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burden of the beasts of the south</span>. Delitzsch thinks that the Egyptians are intended by the "beasts of the south" - the expression pointing primarily to the hippopotamus, which was an apt emblem of the slow-moving Egyptians. But most commentators regard the "beasts" of this clause as equivalent to the "<span class="accented">young</span> asses and camels" mentioned towards the end of the verse. (On the sense of the word "burden," see the introductory paragraph to <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Into the lane of trouble and anguish</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through a laud</span>. It is not Egypt that is spoken of, but the desert between Judaea and Egypt. The reminiscences of this desert were such that the Israelites always exaggerated its terrors and dangers (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come the young and old lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lioness and the lion</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; vol. 1. p. 227). Lions can never have been numerous in the tract in question; but they may have haunted portions of it, when it was better watered than at present. <span class="cmt_word">The viper and fiery flying serpent</span>. Snakes of various kinds have always been abundant in the desert between Judaea and Egypt (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>; Strab., 16. p. 759; Schubert,' Travels,' sol. it. p. 406; Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 499, etc.). Seine of them were believed anciently to have wings (Herod., 2:75; 3:107); but the fact is doubted. Isaiah is not concerned with natural history, but with definitely marking out the locality through which the ambassadors would march. For this purpose it was best to describe it in terms drawn from the popular belief. <span class="cmt_word">Their riches... their treasures</span>. Ambassadors who came to request military aid, as a matter of course carried rich presents with them. <span class="cmt_word">Young asses... camels.</span> The ordinary beasts of burden employed in the passage of the desert (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-26.htm">Genesis 42:26</a>; Herod., 3:9, etc.).

Most translate, "Wherefore I name it" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Egypt) "Rahab, that sits still;" or "Arrogance, that 'sits still." Rahab, "pride" or 'arrogance," would seem to have been an old name for Egypt (<a href="../../par/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), not one given at this time by Isaiah. What he means to say is, "Proud as thou art, thou doest nothing to maintain thy pride, but art content with sitting still." This he "cries" or "proclaims" concerning Egypt, as the most important thing for other nations to know about her.

The denunciation of the Egyptian alliance had been made <span class="accented">viva voce</span>, in the courts of the temple or in some other place of public resort. As he ended, Isaiah received a Divine intimation that the prophecy was to be put on record, doubly, upon a tablet and in a book. At the same time, the "<span class="accented">rebelliousness"</span> of the people was further pointed out, and fresh threats (vers. 13, 14, and 17) were uttered against them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write it before them in a tablet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> write the prophecy before them" (equivalent to "<span class="accented">to</span> be set up before them") "<span class="accented">on a</span> tablet," in the briefest possible form (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And note it in a book</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "and also make a full notation of it in a book," or parchment roll. The "tablet" was to be for the admonition of the living generation of men; the "book" was for future generations, to be a record of God's omniscience and faithfulness "forever and ever." <span class="cmt_word">That it may be for the time to come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for an after-day - not</span> for the immediate present only. <span class="cmt_word">For ever and ever</span>. Modern critics observe that the phrase, <span class="accented">la'ad</span> '<span class="accented">ad</span> '<span class="accented">olam</span>, never occurs elsewhere, and suggest a change of the pointing, which would give the sense of "for a testimony forever." Whether we accept the change or not, the meaning undoubtedly is that consigning the prophecy to a "book" would make an appeal to it possible <span class="accented">in perpetuum</span>. The perpetuity of the written Word is assumed as certain.

But indirectly they let it be understood that this was what they wished. Compare the advice given to Micaiah by Ahab's messenger, who, no doubt, correctly interpreted the wishes of the monarch and his nobles  (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-13.htm">1 Kings 22:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Seers... prophets</span>.

"The Holy One of Israel" was one of Isaiah's most frequent names for the Almighty. He used it especially when rebuking Israel's unholiness (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, etc.). The irreligious Jews were weary of this constant iteration, and wished to hear no more concerning this "Holy One," whose very holiness was a reproach to them.

The "word" intended is probably the prophecy against trusting in Egypt (vers. 1-7). <span class="cmt_word">And trust in oppression</span>; or, <span class="accented">extortion</span>. Oppressive measures employed to obtain the rich gifts which had to be sent into Egypt (ver. 6) are probably intended (setup. <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>). Gratz and Cheyne change the reading from '<span class="accented">oshek</span> to '<span class="accented">ikkesh</span> ("perverseness"); but without any necessity. <span class="cmt_word">And perverseness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">crookedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "tortuous policy" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">And stay thereon</span>; rather, <span class="accented">lean</span> or <span class="accented">stay yourselves thereon</span>.

Isaiah is fond of mixed metaphors, and of superseding one metaphor by another. From comparing Judah's fall and ruin to the shattering of a lofty wall, he suddenly turns to a comparison of it with the breaking to pieces of an earthen pitcher. Judah shall be so broken as when the pitcher is crushed into minute fragments, so that there is no piece large enough to convey a coal from one fire for the lighting of another, or to be of even the least use for drawing water from a well. A complete dissolution of the political fabric is foreshadowed, such as did not actually take effect till the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.

The conditions are put forward, not as now capable of being realized, but as those which might have been realized at an earlier date. The "returning" spoken of is an abandonment of the course hitherto pursued, which was reckless provocation of Assyria and trust in Egypt. The "rest" is staying upon God - renunciation of trust on any arm of flesh, and simple reliance on the Divine aid, as sure to be sufficient when the need came. <span class="cmt_word">In quietness and confidence shall be your strength</span>; rather, <span class="accented">should be</span>.

Therefore it was necessary to let it be seen that the Divine long-suffering was not yet exhausted - there were still conditions under which God would be gracious to his people. The conditions were "crying to the Lord" (ver. 19), and entire abolition of idolatry (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>. "Because your sins require this chastisement" (Kay); "Because of the extremity of your need" (Cheyne). It is, perhaps, best to own that the motives of the Divine action are very commonly obscure; and, if seen clearly by the prophets, are certainly not clearly set forth, being (it may be) inscrutable. While the motive, however, is obscure, the promise is plain and unmistakable, <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</span> God is not about at present to "make a full end;" he is bent on "waiting" - his intent is "to be gracious." He will be exalted, that he may have mercy. He will find some means of vindicating his honor and exalting himself, short of your destruction, in order that it may be open to him to give you a further chance of repentance, whereby you would obtain mercy. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord is a God of judgment</span>. God is essentially just; <span class="accented">sin must</span> receive punishment; but the punishment may be short of destruction. Justice does not exclude mercy. If men bear their punishment with patience, and <span class="cmt_word">wait for God</span>, a brighter day will dawn on them in course of time.

Idolatry, greatly encouraged by Ahaz, had been strictly forbidden by Hezekiah at the beginning of his reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>); but the present passage, among others, shows how impossible it was for a king, with the best intentions, to effect the extirpation of idolatry, if his subjects were attached to it. Evidently the Jews had, in many cases, secretly maintained their idols and their idolatrous practices, despite the efforts of Hezekiah. But now, in their repentance, they would "defile" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroy) both the outer "covering" of precious rectal, and the inner core of wood or stone, or base metallic substance. <span class="cmt_word">The ornament of thy molten images of gold</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the coating</span> or over<span class="accented">laying</span>.

Mr. Cheyne translates, "Shall eat mixed provender with salt." The general idea is clearly that they shall have for their ordinary food that superior kind of provender which, according to existing practices, was reserved for rare occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Winnowed with the shovel</span>.

Equivalent to "the day of vengeance" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>) the day when God shall tread down his enemies.
