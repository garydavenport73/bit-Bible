Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - THE BURDEN OF TYRE. We here reach the last of the "burdens" - the concluding chapter of the series of denunciatory prophecies which commenced with <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. It is an elegy "in three stanzas, or strophes" (Cheyne) - the first extending from ver. 1 to ver. 5; the second, thence to ver. 9; and the third from ver. 10 to ver. 14. An undertone of sadness, and even of commiseration, prevails throughout it, the prophet viewing Tyre as a fellow-sufferer with Israel, persecuted and oppressed by the fame enemy, Assyria, which was everywhere pushing her conquests, and had recently extended her dominion even over Babylon (ver. 13). This last allusion fixes the date of the prophecy to a time subsequent to  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, when the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, first conquered the country, and took the title of king (G. Smith, 'Epanym Canon,' p. 86). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, 31). The expression is common in the prophets (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>, etc.: <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-2.htm">Ezekiel 30:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-5.htm">Joel 1:5, 11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye ships of Tarshish</span>. "Ships of Tarshish" are first mentioned in connection with the trade carried on by Solomon. Apparently, the term there designates a certain class of ship rather than those engaged in a particular trade (see the comment on 1 Kings 22:48 in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 2. p. 623). Here, however, Phoenician ships, actually engaged in the trade with Tartessus, may be intended. Tartessus was a very ancient Phoenician settlement in the south of Spain, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and was the center of a most important and lucrative commerce (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; Herod., i. 163; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, etc.). In the present passage the returning fleet of merchantmen is addressed, and told that the harbour to which they are hastening is closed, the city desolate. <span class="cmt_word">From the land of Chittim</span>. "Chittim" here, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>, and elsewhere <span class="accented">generally</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> probably Cyprus, whose most ancient capital was called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Kitten</span> (see Joseph, 'Ant. Jud,' 1:6, &sect; 1). The name "Chittim" is not improbably a variant of "Khittim," "the Hittites," who may have been the first to colonize the island. A fleet from the Western Mediterranean would naturally touch at Cyprus on its way to Tyro, and would there learn the calamity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be still</span>; rather, <span class="accented">be silent</span>, as in the margin. It would be idle to complain or lament. <span class="cmt_word">Ye inhabitants of the isle</span>. Tyro was situated on a small isle, which Alexander joined to the mainland by means of a mole (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 2:23). It is uncertain, however, whether this isle is meant here, or the strip of Phoenician coast, since the Hebrew '<span class="accented">i</span> has both meanings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whom the merchants of Zidon... have replenished</span>. During the flourishing period of Tyro (B.C. 1025-585), Zidon, though it had generally kings of its own, played a secondary part to Tyre, and for the most part acquiesced in Tyrian supremacy. Its best sailors served in the Tyrian fleet (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>), and its merchants were content to enrich the recognized "chief city."

The Egyptian vessels conveyed the corn intended for exportation to the ports at the mouths of the Nile, where it was transhipped aboard Phoenician craft, which carried it on the open sea to the countries needing it. We never hear of the Egyptians disputing the trade of the Mediterranean with the Phoenicians and the Greeks, though they certainly had trading-vessels at times on the waters of the Red Sea. <span class="cmt_word">The seed of Sihor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the corn of the Nile valley. "Si-her," or rather "Shihor," <span class="accented">is</span> the only proper name by which the Nile is designated in the Hebrew Scriptures. It means "the dark," "the turbid," and may be compared with the modern "<span class="accented">Bahr-el-azrak</span>," used of the Eastern or Abyssinian Nile, and with the term" Nilus" itself, if that signifies "the dark blue stream." It occurs, as the name of the Nile, only in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>; and the present place. <span class="cmt_word">Is her revenue</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "produces a portion of her annual income." <span class="cmt_word">And she is a man of nations</span> (so Gesenius and Ewald). Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "It is the <span class="accented">gain</span> of the nations," referring "it' to the corn which the Tyrians exported.

Zidon, the most ancient and venerable of the Phoenician cities (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; Justin, 18:3, etc.), is called upon to feel shame because Tyre is captured. The ruin of the metropolitan city would be felt as a disgrace by all the lesser towns, and by Zidon especially. <span class="cmt_word">The sea... even the strength of the sea</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the stronghold of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Tyre herself.

The Egyptians bore no great affection towards any foreign nation. They were a people whose charity began and ended at home. But the fall of Tyre was always a shock to them, and was felt to portend evil to themselves. The Asiatic power which was strong enough to capture the island-fortress would be a formidable enemy to Egypt itself, and might be expected at no distant date to attempt the conquest of the Nile valley. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye over to Tarshish</span>. The advice was good, and may, perhaps, have been followed to some extent. When Sennacherib attacked Elulaeus of Sidon ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), that monarch fled across the sea ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 35), probably to Cyprus. When Alexander finally ruined Tyre, a part of the population made its escape on shipboard to Carthage (Arrian,' Exp. Alex.,' 2:24, &sect; 8). An escape of the kind is represented in the Assyrian sculptures (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 7l).

Herodotus was told (about  <span class="date">B.C. 450</span>) that its temple of Hercules (Melkarth) had been built two thousand three hundred years previously (Herod., 2:44). Q. Curtius makes the city to have been founded by Agenor, the father of Cadmus, who was supposed to have lived three hundred years before the Trojan War ('Vit. Alex.,' 4:4). It must be noted, however, on the other hand, that there is no mention at all of <span class="accented">Tyro</span> in Homer, and none in Scripture until the time of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>), about  <span class="date">B.C. 1300</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn</span> (so Lowth, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Ewald, Kay).

Either to the governors of her colonies, or perhaps to the other cities of Phoenicia Proper.

Tyre, which, according to some, was built by fugitives from Zidon, or Phoenicia generally, of which Zidon, as the "firstborn" (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), was a sort of mother. <span class="cmt_word">Pass over to Chittim</span> (comp. ver. 6). Chittim (Cyprus) was a nearer refuge than Tarshish, and far more easily reached; but, on the other hand, it was much less safe. Sargon and Esarhaddon both of them exercised dominion over it; and when Abdi-Milkut, King of Sidon, fled there in the reign of the latter, the Assyrian monarch pursued him, caught him, and "cut off his head" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 137). Still, it was so often sought by princes flying from Phoenicia when attacked by Assyria, that cuneiform scholars call it "the usual refuge of the Phoenician kings" ('Transactions of Bibl. Archaeology Society,' vol. 4. p. 86). <span class="cmt_word">There also shalt thou have no rest</span>. Cyprus submitted to Sargon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 26), and again to Esarhaddon (ibid., vol. 8. p. 108). It was included in the dominions of Asshur-bani-pal (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 31, 32). After Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Tyre, it was annexed by Egypt (Herod., 2:182), on the conquest of which country by Cambyses it became Persian. The Phoenicians had "no rest" there after Assyria had once found her way to the island.

Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Isaiah knows the people as Chahleans (Kasdim), the capital as Babylon. Kaldi, in the inscriptions, is a rare word, and the name of a not very important tribe. Yet Berosus uses the term to designate the whole nation. <span class="cmt_word">This people was not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "is no more a people" - "has ceased to exist."

Sennacherib reconquered it in  <span class="date">B.C. 704</span>, and again in  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, when he made his eldest son viceroy. Esarhaddon ruled over both countries, as did Asshur-bani-pal. Though later (about  <span class="date">B.C. 620-610</span>) Babylon reasserted her independence, and became a great empire, yet Isaiah was justified, at almost any period of his life after  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, in speaking of her as non-existent. <span class="cmt_word">Till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness</span>. There is no "till" in the original. The clause is separate and independent, not connected grammatically with the preceding. Nor does it assert that the Assyrians "founded" Babylon for any one, but only that they "established" it, or "appointed" it to be a habitation for "the <span class="accented">beasts of the desert"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:39, etc.).

"He" is "the Assyrian." The case of Babylon is adduced to increase the alarm of Tyro, by reminding the inhabitants of what the Assyrians had done to a town greater and stronger than their own. The allusion is probably to certain severities of Sargon's in  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, which, however, are rhetorically exaggerated. It was never the policy of the Assyrians to depopulate or destroy Babylon.

St. Jerome thought that this prophecy had not been accomplished in his day. If so, it cannot be said to have been accomplished yet; unless, indeed, Tyre may be regarded as representing the commercial spirit, which. under Christianity, is not necessarily alien from religion, but shows itself sometimes altogether friendly to the Church, supplying ways and means for ten thousand  philanthropic and praiseworthy enterprises (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyro shall be forgotten</span>; i.e. "shall cease to occupy men's thoughts, as a factor in politics - shall pass out of their calculations, and count for nothing." <span class="cmt_word">Seventy years</span>. "Forty years" and "seventy years" are the chief representatives in Scripture of an indefinite time. The week of creation seems to have given to seven its quasi-sacred character, which passed from the primary number to the corresponding decimal one. The sacred use of "seventy" appears first in the "seventy elders" who accompanied Moses to the covenant-feast on Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>). After this, "seventy 'talents are mentioned as the weight of the bronze offerings for the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a>), and "seventy" shekels as the weight of the silver bowls offered by the heads of tribes when the tabernacle was set up (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13-85</a>). The "indefinite" us, of "seventy" is most apparent in such expressions as that of <a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>, "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, surely Lamech <span class="accented">seventy</span> and sevenfold;" and that of <a href="../../par/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>, "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until <span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven." "Seventy" seems also to be indefinite in <a href="../../par/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-9.htm">Numbers 33:9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-13.htm">Judges 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>: <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-14.htm">1 Chronicles 21:14</a>, etc. It is absurd to count the "seventy years" of the present passage, as some do, from the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the death of Nabonidus, for neither did Tyro begin to be forgotten in the first year of the one prince, nor did she immediately recover herself on the death of the other. <span class="cmt_word">According to the days of one king</span>; or, <span class="accented">like the days of one king</span>. The period, whatever its length, should be to Type "like the days of one king;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unchanging, without hope. Oriental kings prided themselves on maintaining an unaltered policy (cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall Tyre sing as an harlot</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it shall be to Tyre as</span> [<span class="accented">in</span>] <span class="accented">the song of the harlot</span>. <span class="accented">A</span> particular song seems to be meant, part of which the prophet proceeds to quote in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-16.htm">Isaiah 23:16</a></div><div class="verse">Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take an harp</span>. Harlots in the East, and indeed in the West also in ancient times (Her., 'Epist.,' 1:14, 1. 25), were expected to be musicians. The harp and the guitar were their usual instruments. <span class="cmt_word">Forgotten harlot</span>. In addressing. Tyro as a "harlot," the prophet does not seem to mean more than that her aims were, or at any rate had been, selfish and worldly, such as sever between man and God. She had pursued wealth for the enjoyments that it brought her, not in order to make a good use of it. Hers had been the covetousness which is "idolatry" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will visit Tyre</span>. In mercy, not in judgment (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-22.htm">Jeremiah 27:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). She shall turn to her hire; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to her commerce," to her former mode of life. But with the difference noted in ver. 18. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a></div><div class="verse">And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord</span>. There is nothing intrinsically wrong or debasing in commerce. Rightly pursued, and engaged in with the view of devoting the profits made in it to good and pious ends, the commercial life may be as religious, and as acceptable to God as any other. The world has known many merchants who were Christians, in the highest sense of the word. Solomon in his best days was a merchant (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-27.htm">1 Kings 9:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), but one who employed the wealth which he derived from commerce to the honor and glory of God. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be treasured nor laid up</span>. The merchants shall not lay it up in their own coffers, but expend it wisely and religiously. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be for them that dwell before the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it shall be applied to religious uses - to the sustentation of ministers, the relief of the poor and necessitous among God's people, and other similar purposes. Such an employment of the gains made sanctifies commerce, and makes it a good and a blessed thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
