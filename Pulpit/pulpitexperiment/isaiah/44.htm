This section is closely connected with ch. 43, of which it ought to form the conclusion. The prophet cannot bear to leave Israel under a ban - its spiritual guides "profaned," and itself given over to "reproaches." He must end with a brighter prospect. Accordingly, he holds out, in the present passage, the double hope <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the blessing of an abundant outpouring of the Spirit, to take the place of the preceding "curse" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of a pressing of proselytes into the renovated Church, who will hold it in honour, instead of making it the object of their "reproaches." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet now hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not dismayed at what has been said. Listen a little longer." <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob my servant</span>, etc. A recurrence to the terms of endearment used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, showing that words of favour and' promise are about to follow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, <i>which</i> will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 7</a>). "From the womb" is added here for increased emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">Jesurun</span>. The Lord's people have their proper names - Jacob, Israel, Jesurun, or rather, Jeshurun. "Jacob" marks them simply as descendants of the patriarch - the people to whom the promises were made. "Israel" marks their militant character - that as "God's soldiers" they fought his battles and maintained his cause in the midst of a hostile world. The third name, "Jeshurun," which is very rarely used (only here and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5, 26</a>), designates them as "righteous," being a derivative from the root <span class="accented">yashar</span> (or <span class="accented">joshar</span>), equivalent to "upright," and points to that standard of moral excellence which it was their duty to set forth, and which to some extent they did set forth, in a world that "lay in wickedness." Had they been more worthy of the name, it would probably have been oftener applied to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pour water upon him that is thirsty</span>. "Water" is, in Isaiah, the common metaphor for Divine grace. Sometimes, as in this place (and <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), the simple <span class="accented">maim</span>, "water" or "waters," is the word used. At other times we have instead, or in addition, "rain" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>), or "dew" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>), or "rivers" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, etc.), or "streams" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), or "floods" (as in this place). At his coming on earth, our blessed Lord took up the comparison, and has made it familiar to all men throughout the whole Christian world (see <a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 11, 13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>). We may note here that the "water" is only poured on him who is athirst for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed...  thine offspring</span>. Not "Israel after the flesh" only, but also Israel after the Spirit - the true "Israel of God" (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall spring up <i>as</i> among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall spring up as among the grass</span>. The LXX. have, "As grass among the waters;" and this reading is followed by Bishop Lowth, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. But there does not seem to be any necessity for departing from the existing Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">As willows</span>. There is some doubt whether the Hebrew word used ('<span class="accented">ereb</span>) is rightly translated "willows." The modern <span class="accented">yarab</span> seems certainly not to be a "willow," but rather a species of <span class="accented">Viburnum</span> (see the long note in Delitzsch's 'Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2. pp. 203, 204, Eng. trans.). It is, however, most strictly a water-plant, growing only "near flowing water." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a></div><div class="verse">One shall say, I <i>am</i> the LORD'S; and another shall call <i>himself</i> by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe <i>with</i> his hand unto the LORD, and surname <i>himself</i> by the name of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One shall say, I am the Lord's</span>, etc. There shall be an influx of proselytes. Instead of the heathen nations looking scornfully on, and uttering gibes and jeers (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>) at Israel's fall, on seeing Israel's rise they shall be anxious to have a part in it, and shall hasten to enrol themselves among the worshippers of Jehovah. "One shall say, I am Jehovah's," - while "another shall proclaim the name of Jacob," as that in which he glories; and a third "shall write on his hand, (I am) Jehovah's, and take as a surname the name of Israel." It was usual among the heathen nations to mark the name of a god upon the bodies of persons specially devoted to him (Herod., 2:113; 7:235); and, though the practice was forbidden to Israelites (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), it might naturally continue in use among semi-heathen proselytes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I <i>am</i> the first, and I <i>am</i> the last; and beside me <i>there is</i> no God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-20.</span> - A FURTHER CONTRAST OF GOD WITH IDOLS. The captive Jews, dwelling scattered in a land the inhabitants of which were, one and all, idolaters, and having by hereditary taint an inclination to idolatry, would be easily tempted, during the long and weary period of the Captivity, to put away the worship and even the thought of Jehovah, who had allowed their subjugation, and conform to the religion of their conquerors. Hence the repeated contrasts in these later chapters - specially addressed to <span class="accented">caprice</span> Israel - between Jehovah and idols, and the sharp ridicule of the  latter (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4-7, 21-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord the King of Israel</span>. Therefore entitled to Israel's allegiance (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>). And his Redeemer; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel's Redeemer - he who had redeemed them from Egyptian bondage - who will redeem them from the power of Babylon - who, best of all, will redeem them from their sins. <span class="cmt_word">The First...  the Last</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, with the comment). <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no God</span>. This had been distinctly asserted in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>); but Israel could not be induced practically to believe it. The "gods of the nations" were supposed generally to be realities, actual powers, not perhaps so potent as Jehovah, but still real beings, capable of doing good and harm (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>). It is one of Isaiah's special objects in these later chapters to disabuse Israel of this notion (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5, 6, 14-22</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a></div><div class="verse">And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, as I, shall call</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Who will do (or who <span class="accented">can</span> do) as I do - call events into being, declare them, and set them in order beforehand - who can do this for me (or, in my stead)? No one. I have done it, ever since I appointed (or, placed upon earth) the ancient people" that is, the race of men before the Flood (see <a href="../../par/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). The claim is that, from the first creation of mankind, God has not only prearranged the events that should happen, but has declared them by the mouth of prophets (see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>, 23; 9:12-16, etc.). No other has done the same. <span class="cmt_word">The things that are coming, and shall come</span>. Not earlier and later events, but "future events," and "such as will actually come to pass" (Kay, Cheyne). Let the idol-gods declare these, if they are to be entitled to consideration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a></div><div class="verse">Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared <i>it</i>? ye <i>are</i> even my witnesses.

Israel need not fear that they will be forgotten or forsaken. God has told them from that time, or, <span class="accented">from the beginning</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3, 7</a>), and declared to them, what he is about to do - viz, destroy Babylon, and give them deliverance.

Their delectable things shall not profit. "Their delectable things" are their idols, which are "pets, favourites, treasures." These cannot possibly be of any advantage to them. They are their own witnesses. Their powerlessness stands confessed in their very appearance, since they are manifestly sightless and senseless. That they may be ashamed. The subject of this clause cannot be sought in the earlier part of the verse. It is the <span class="accented">idol-makers</span> that will be put to shame.

The Hebrew text is defective, some word having fallen out. We should probably supply "maketh," and translate, <span class="accented">The smith maketh an axe</span>, <span class="accented">and worketh it in the coals</span>, <span class="accented">and with hammers fashioneth it.</span> The description of image-making thus commences with the fashioning of the carpenter's tools. <span class="accented">He is hungry</span>, etc. The artificer who takes the first step in "forming a god" (ver. 10) is himself hungry and thirsty, depending on so mean a thing as food to supply him with the needful strength. Unless he can cat and drink, the whole work is brought to a standstill. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a></div><div class="verse">The carpenter stretcheth out <i>his</i> rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The carpenter</span>, etc. When the smith has done his part in the formation of tools, the carpenter is called into action. His proceedings are traced "extragressively." (Delitzsch). First, he is regarded as in possession of his block of wood. On this he proceeds to stretch out his rule, to obtain the idol's length and breadth. Then he marks out on the block a rough outline with red chalk (<span class="accented">sered</span>). After this he pares away the superfluous wood with planes, or chisels, and marks out the limbs more accurately with the compass, planing and measuring until he has brought the rough block into  the figure of a man, and impressed on it something of the beauty of a man, so that it may seem worthy of remaining in the place where it is set up, whether temple or private house. But there is something necessarily anterior to all this. To obtain his block, the carpenter must first cut down a tree, or have one cut down for him (ver. 14); to obtain a tree, he (or some one for him) must have planted it; for the tree to have grown to a fitting size, the rain must have watered it. So the very existence of these wooden idols depends ultimately on whether it has rained or not - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whether God has given his rain or withheld it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a></div><div class="verse">He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedars...  cypress...  oak</span>. The second of the trees mentioned is more probably the ilex than the cypress, which does not grow either in Palestine or in Babylonia. Idols would be made of cedar on account of its fragrance, of flex and oak on account of their hardness and durability. Cedar was used as a material for carved figures in Egypt (Birch, 'Contents of British Museum,' p. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest</span>. The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay translates, "and he <span class="accented">encourages himself in</span> the trees of the forest," which conveys no very distinct idea; Delitzsch, "and he <span class="accented">chooses</span> for himself among the trees," etc., which is sufficiently clear, but scarcely obtainable from the Hebrew text; Knobel, "he makes himself secure among the trees" (by putting a mark on those which he intends to have), which imparts an idea certainly not contained in the original. <span class="cmt_word">He planteth an ash</span>. It is uncertain, and it does not greatly matter, what tree is intended. The point is that, before trees can grow up, they have to be planted, and that, for them to grow when planted, God's gift of rain is necessary (see the comment on ver. 13).

The cause of all this folly is a Minding of the understanding, divinely caused in the way of punishment, on account of their having wilfully closed their eyes to the truth. Because they "did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate (or, undistinguishing) mind" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath shut</span>; or, <span class="accented">One hath shut.</span> But the reference is in either case to God.

The deceived soul is bound in trammels, which it feels to be irksome, and from which it would fain be free. But it cannot deliver itself. Deliverance must come from some external source; in other words, man needs a Deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span> An idol is "a lie." It professes to have power, strength, ability to help and save, whereas it has no power at all. It cannot even save itself. Savages often beat their fetishes. Diagoras of Melos threw an image of Hercules into the fire on which he was cooking his dinner, and bade Hercules make himself of some use by boiling his turnips. The powerlessness of idols even to help themselves is represented with much force in the Book of Baruch (6:12-15, 17-22, 27, 49, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-21.htm">Isaiah 44:21</a></div><div class="verse">Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou <i>art</i> my servant: I have formed thee; thou <i>art</i> my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28.</span> - ISRAEL ONCE MORE PROMISED DELIVERANCE, AND THE DELIVERER MENTIONED BY NAME. Israel, having been exhorted never to forget the impotency of idols (ver. 21), is promised forgiveness and deliverance (vers. 21, 22). Then, heaven and earth are called upon to join in rejoicing over the announcement (ver. 23). Finally, in a noble burst of poetry, God is represented as solemnly declaring his intention of frustrating all the false sayings of the soothsayers concerning his people, and accomplishing their restoration to their own land, and the rebuilding of their temple through the instrumentality of Cyrus (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the futility of idols  and the folly of the idol-worshippers.

I have formed thee (so also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 21</a>; vers. 2, 24). The duty of absolute unquestioning obedience seems contained in the relation of that which is formed to that which has formed it. On the other hand, it may be assumed that he who has formed a thing will have a constant care of it and regard for it - that at any rate he will not "forget" it.

It would be better to translate, <span class="accented">as a cloud</span>...  <span class="accented">as a thick cloud.</span> The latter of the two Hebrew words used is the more emphatic. Return unto me. This is an underlying condition, both of restoration and of forgiveness. Only the penitent can be received back into favour. The knowledge, however, that God has, in his counsels, "redeemed" his people generally, may act as a stimulus on individuals to repent and turn to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a></div><div class="verse">Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done <i>it</i>: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O ye heavens</span>. The sympathy of external nature with the fortunes of Israel is assumed throughout Isaiah, as it is throughout the Psalms (see <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>-8; 24:4-7; 29:17; 30:25, 26; 33:9; 35:1, 2, 7, etc.). If Israel is depressed, the earth must "mourn and languish," the heavens grow dark; the mountains shrink and "be ashamed." If, on the contrary, Israel prospers, heaven and earth, mountain and forest, <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>),of the joy felt by the angels over the returning and pardoned sinner; but the context of both passages is in favour of the material heavens being meant. It is quite possible that there is a real and not merely a fancied sympathy between the material and the spiritual worlds. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath done it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the Lord hath wrought - what</span> he has wrought is not said. Mr. Cheyne translates, "Jehovah hath done <span class="accented">nobly."</span> Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Metonymy of the part for the whole - "the lower parts of the earth" for "the earth even to its lowest depths." There is no thought of <span class="accented">Sheol</span> or of its inhabitants. Break forth into singing (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>). As children and birds sing from the very gladness of their hearts, thereby venting the joy that almost oppresses them, so all nature is called upon, not merely to rejoice, but to give vent to its joy, now that Israel is redeemed and God glorified.

This is not a new prophecy entirely unconnected with the preceding, as Delitzsch supposes, lint a declaration to which the prophet has been working up, and which he intends as the crown and climax of all that he has been announcing with respect to Israel's deliverance. Not only is the deliverance absolutely determined on in God's counsels, but the Deliverer himself is already chosen and designated. <span class="cmt_word">He that formed thee from the womb</span> (comp. ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord that maketh all things</span> - rather, <span class="accented">I the Lord am he that doeth all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I am he that executeth whatever he designs - <span class="cmt_word">that stretcheth forth the heavens alone</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>), <span class="cmt_word">that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself</span>.

The "messengers" are the prophets generally. Before the return from the Captivity took place, it had been prophesied, not only by Isaiah, but by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>), by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-25.htm">Ezekiel 39:25-28</a>), by <a href="../../par/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1</a>), by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-15</a>), by Obadiah (Obadiah:20), by Micah (<a href="../../par/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>), and by Zephaniah (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-20</a>).

"The flood" here is probably the main stream of the Euphrates, while "the rivers" are the various side streams which branched off from it and again united themselves with it. Some commentators regard the drying of Euphrates as a mere metaphor for the exhaustion and ruin of Babylon (Kay); but (with Delitzsch) I should be inclined to understand a reference to the action of Cyrus in drawing off the water of the river (see the comment on Isaiah 42:15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a></div><div class="verse">That saith of Cyrus, <i>He is</i> my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That saith of Cyrus</span>. The mention of Cyrus by name, here and again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, has no doubt been one of the main grounds on which has been set up the theory of two Isaiahs. It has been thought incredible, or at any rate contrary to the analogy  of prophetical revelation, that so minute a matter as the name of a man should have been announced in prophecy more than a century before his birth. There is, however, the parallel case of Josiah, who, according to the author of the Books of Kings, was announced by name more than three centuries before his birth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). And there are the extremely minute facts noted in <a href="../../par/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, which were prophetically de-dared from two centuries to three centuries and a half before they happened. It is, perhaps, assuming that we know more than we really do know about the object and laws of prophetic utterance, to lay it down that there can be no minute prophecy except when the prophet is living in the midst of the events. It is certainly a very marvellous thing that Isaiah, living at the close of the eighth and the beginning of the  <span class="date">seventh century B.C.</span>, should -mention a king by name who did not ascend the throne till the middle of the sixth; but no one can suppose that God could not have made such a revelation to him if he pleased. An attempt to minimize the marvel, without postulating two Isaiahs, has been made by the supposition that "Cyrus" was not really a proper name, but an old title of the Persian (Achaemenian) kings, signifying" the sun," and that Isaiah, therefore, only meant to point out Persia as the power which would destroy Babylon, which he had already done in effect in <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>. But, in reality, there is no sufficient ground for either of the two statements <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Cyrus meant "the sun," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That "Cyrus" meant "the sun," rests upon the weak authorities of Plutarch and Ctesias, and has been disproved by Sir H. Rawlinson ('Cuneiform Inscriptions,' vol. 2, p. 112). That it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings is directly contrary to the evidence. Out of fourteen Achaemenian kings, two only bore the name; and they bore it as their one and only personal appellation. It was also borne by an Achaemenian prince who had no other name. It is as purely a proper name as Cambyses, or Xerxes, or Darius. The theory of Dean Plumptre ('Biblical Studies,' p. 195) must therefore be set aside as untenable, and we must face the fact that the great Cyrus, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>, is mentioned in prophecies attributed to a writer whose death cannot be placed much later than  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>. The name which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Romans by "Cyrus," is in the original Persian <span class="accented">Kurush</span>, in the old Babylonian <span class="accented">Kuras</span>, and in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Koresh. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He is my shepherd</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere ordinary king, who was often called "the shepherd of his people (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)," but "my shepherd" - the shepherd of my people, who will tend them and care for them. <span class="cmt_word">And shall perform</span> (literally, <span class="accented">accomplish</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all my pleasure</span>. Cyrus is said by Josephus to have had ibis prophecy pointed out to him on his conquest of Babylon, and to have thereupon determined to fulfil what was written ('Ant. Jud.,' 12:1, &sect; 2). His edict, reported by Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a>), contained a statement that "Jehovah had charged him to build him a house at Jerusalem." It is difficult to see any sufficient <span class="accented">political</span> object for his restoration of the Jews to their country. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be built</span>; rather, <span class="accented">it shall be built. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy foundation shall be laid</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it shall be founded.</span> The decree of Cyrus found by Darius at Ecbatana required that "the foundations of the house should be strongly laid" (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>), and prescribed its dimensions and materials.
