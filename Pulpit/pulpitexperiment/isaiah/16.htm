This portion of the "burden" is divided into three sections. In section 1 (from ver. 1 to the end of ver. 5) an offer of mercy is made to Moab on certain conditions, viz. that she return to her allegiance to the house of David, and show kindness to fugitive Israelites. In section 2 (vers. 6-12) she is supposed to have rejected this offer, and is threatened (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>.) with severe punishment. In section 3 (which consists of vers. 13 and 14) the time is fixed for the main visitation to fall upon her. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lamb of the ruler of the land -</span> the lamb (or lambs, <span class="accented">kar</span> being used collectively) due to the ruler as a mark of subjection. In the time of Ahab Mesha had paid a tribute to Israel of a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams annually (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The prophet recommends that this, or some similar, tribute should now be paid to the King of Judah instead. Israel having been absorbed into Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">From Sela</span>. Either Moab is regarded as having taken refuge in Edom, and is therefore bidden to send her tribute from the Edomite capital, Sela (equivalent to "Petra"), or "Sela," here is not a proper name, but a collective used to designate the rocky parts of Moab, to which she had betaken herself (as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-28.htm">Jeremiah 48:28</a>). The latter supposition is, on the whole, the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">To the wilderness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wildernesswards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the way of the wilderness. The enemy being regarded as in possession of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Moab is recommended to send her tribute round the southern end, and so by way of "the wilderness of Judah," to Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">For it shall be, <i>that</i>, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, <i>so</i> the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it shall be</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it shall be</span>. The tribute having been paid, Moab will regain some confidence. Her fluttered population will return, and collect at the fords of the Amen, ready to recross it. <span class="cmt_word">As a wandering bird cast out of the nest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a wandering bird</span> (or, <span class="accented">wandering birds</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "<span class="accented">as</span> a scattered nest" (or, "brood of nestlings"). <span class="cmt_word">The daughters of Moab</span>. The population of Moab generally, as "the daughter of Zion" (ver. 1) is the population of Jerusalem generally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-3.htm">Isaiah 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take counsel, execute judgment</span>, etc. According to most critics, these are the words of the Moabites, or of a Moabite ambassador at Jerusalem, and are a call on Judaea to give shelter to the fugitives from Moab. Some, however, as Dr. Kay, maintain that the words are the prophet's, addressed to Moab, calling on her to treat kindly fugitives from Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Make thy shadow as the night</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>). In the hot land of Moab the sun is an enemy, and "the shadow of a great rock" a welcome refuge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab</span>. The change of one accent will allow of this passage being translated, <span class="accented">Let the outcasts of Moab dwell with thee</span>; and so it is rendered by the LXX., the Syriac, by Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. Delitzsch and Dr. Kay agree with the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">For the extortioner is at an end</span>. This seems to be urged as a reason why the protection asked should be given: it will not be for long - the oppressor is about to receive chastisement. He is called "the extortioner," as exacting the utmost possible tribute from conquered lands. Such exaction was characteristic of Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; 'Assyrian Inscriptions,' <span class="accented">passim</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The spoiler ceaseth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devastation ceaseth</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in mercy shall the throne be established</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and there shall be a throne established in mercy</span>. A Messianic vision comes upon the prophet in connection with the disappearance of the oppressor. There shall be one day - he knows not how soon or how late - a throne established in mercy, and "One shall be seated upon it in truth, who. shall occupy the tent [or, 'house'] of David, as one who judges, and seeks justice, and hastens on [the reign of] righteousness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">We have heard of the pride of Moab; <i>he is</i> very proud: <i>even</i> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: <i>but</i> his lies <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have heard of the pride of Moab</span>. A new section commences. Moab has not accepted the offer of mercy made in vers. 1-5, and is therefore denounced afresh. Her "pride" prevented her from renewing her subjection to the house of David, and therefore it is her pride which is specially condemned. <span class="cmt_word">His lies shall not be so</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of no worth are his boast-tags</span>. The result will not correspond with them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely <i>they are</i> stricken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall howl</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the whole of it shall howl</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the entire nation collectively (comp. Herod., 8:99; 9:24). <span class="cmt_word">For the foundations of Kir-Hareseth shall ye mourn</span>. The word here translated "foundations" is elsewhere always rendered "flagons" or "flagons of wine" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). And this rendering is more agreeable to the context than "foundations," since it is the loss of the products of the soil which is threatened in the next three verses. "Kir-Hareseth" is probably the same place as the "Kir-Moab" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>. It was one of the principal cities of Moab (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-25.htm">2 Kings 2:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">For the fields of Heshbon languish, <i>and</i> the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come <i>even</i> unto Jazer, they wandered <i>through</i> the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fields of Heshbon</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). The whole of the Mishor, or Belka, on the edge of which <span class="accented">Hesbdn</span> stands, is cultivable and capable of producing good crops. The Moabites stored water in reservoirs (<a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>), and made their country a garden. <span class="cmt_word">The vine of Sib-mah</span>. "Sibmah" is mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-8.htm">Numbers 32:8</a> and <a href="../../par/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a> among the towns of the Reubenites. According to Jerome ('Comment. in Esaiam'), it was less than half a mile distant from Heshbon. Jeremiah follows Isaiah in lamenting the destruction of its vines (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof</span>. "The lords of the heathen" are probably the Assyrians, who made a practice of destroying the fruit trees in an enemy's country, for the mere purpose of doing mischief ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 84). It is wanton to discard this very satisfactory sense for the strange one that "the choice plants have broken <span class="accented">down -</span> i.e., made drunk - the lords of the heathen" (Cheyne). The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by Gesenius, Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Meier, and Dr. Kay. <span class="cmt_word">They are come even unto Jazer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">the vines</span>)<span class="accented">reached to Jazer</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vine of Sibmah was cultivated as far as Jazer. Jazer lay about twelve miles north of Heshben, in the territory of Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). It is probably identified with <span class="accented">Es Szir</span>, which is in the required position, and retains a trace of the name (Seetzen,' Reisen,' vol. 1. pp. 397, 398). <span class="cmt_word">They wandered through the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they strayed into the wilderness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cultivation was pushed eastward into the actual <span class="accented">midbar</span>, or desert. <span class="cmt_word">Her branches are stretched out</span>; or, <span class="accented">her offshoots are spread abroad</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the young shoots or slips are taken by the cultivators and spread further and further. They are even carried across the Dead Sea, and planted on its western shore. Mr. Cheyne supposes the prophet to refer to the "vineyards of En-gedi" (<a href="../../par/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I will bewail</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, and see the Homiletics on that verse). <span class="cmt_word">With the weeping of Jazer</span>. "With tears as genuine as Jazer's own" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">O Heshbon and Elealeh</span> (on the close connection of these two cities, see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). <span class="cmt_word">For the shouting</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">for on thy summer fruits and on thy harvest a shouting is fallen</span>. The "shouting" intended is that of the invading  enemy, which replaces the ordinary joy-song of the vintagers (see ver. 10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in <i>their</i> presses; I have made <i>their vintage</i> shouting to cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The plentiful field</span>; Hebrew, Carmel. The word <span class="accented">carmel</span> seems to designate "garden," or "orchard ground" generally, without reference to the degree of fertility. It is generally rendered by our translators "fruitful field," which is right, if we regard "fruitful" as equivalent to "fruit-producing." <span class="cmt_word">No singing... no shouting</span>. Those who have heard the vintage-songs in the north of Italy and elsewhere will appreciate the sadness of this silence. <span class="cmt_word">The treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses</span>. Wine-presses were in or near the vineyards. They consisted of two vats, or two reservoirs cut in the rock, one above the other, with a passage of communication between them. The grapes were placed in the upper vat or reservoir, and were crushed by the naked feet of the vintagers. Sometimes as many as seven persons "trod the wine-press" together (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 45). It was usual for them to sing as they trod (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</span> The prophet is the mouthpiece of God. Accidentally, as it were, he here betrays the personality which is behind him. It is not he, but God, who has caused the invasion which has reduced the vintagers to silence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they shall vibrate with thrills of grief (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-12.htm">Isaiah 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it is seen that Moab is weary</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when Moab shows himself</span>, <span class="accented">and has wearied himself</span>. The heathen "thought to be heard for their much speaking" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>). They endeavored to weary their gods into granting their prayers (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>), and frequently succeeded in wearying themselves. <span class="cmt_word">On the high place</span>. "High places" (<span class="accented">bamoth</span>) were common to the Moabites, with the other nations of Syria and Palestine. Mesha, in his inscription, speaks of having rebuilt a city called "Beth-Bamoth" (1:27), which must have been a "city of high places;" and he even calls the <span class="accented">stele</span> which he dedicates to Chemosh, whereon his inscription is written, a <span class="accented">bamah</span>, or "high place." <span class="cmt_word">That he shall come to his sanctuary</span>... <span class="cmt_word">but he shall not</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and has come into his sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">that he shall not prevail</span>.

This prophecy, Isaiah says, is one, not now delivered for the first time, but existent previously. How long previously, he leaves quite vague. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant <i>shall be</i> very small <i>and</i> feeble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>. "Now" - an addition has been made to the prophecy. Isaiah is authorized to announce that in three years' time, counted as strictly as possible, the judgment pronounced shall fall on Moab; her "glory" shall be turned into shame, her "multitude" shall be cut off, and only a "remnant" shall be left, weak, small, and powerless. <span class="cmt_word">As the years of an hireling</span>. Counted with the utmost exactness. A hireling would not consent to serve a day longer than his contract bound him, nor would his master consent that he should serve a day short of it. <span class="cmt_word">With all that great multitude.</span> We have no means of accurately estimating the population of Moab. The entire area of the region which the Moabites inhabited seems to have been not more than fifteen hundred square miles. The greater part of it was, however, exceedingly fertile; and we are, perhaps, justified in allowing it a population of two hundred to the square mile, which is about that of Germany. This would give three hundred thousand inhabitants, of whom the adult males would be seventy-five thousand. <span class="cmt_word">Feeble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">not powerful</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> very much the contrary, very weak.
