My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL REBUKED BY THE PARABLE OF A VINEYARD. This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-16</a>), has been frequently noticed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now will I sing to my Well-beloved.</span> The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with "My Well-beloved," and ending with "wild grapes." It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name "Well-beloved" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">A song of my Well-beloved.</span> Bishop Lowth translates "A song of loves," and Mr. Cheyne "A love-song;" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is <span class="accented">not</span> a "love-song." May we not understand the words to mean "a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?" <span class="cmt_word">Touching his vineyard</span>. Israel is compared to a "vine" in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the Church of God to a "garden" in Canticles (<a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>); perhaps also to a "vineyard" in the same book (<a href="../../par/songs/8-12.htm">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">My Beloved hath a vineyard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">had a vineyard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In a very fruitful hill</span>. So the passage is generally understood, since <span class="accented">keren</span>, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and "son of oil" is a not unlikely Orientalism for "rich" or "fruitful." With the "hill" of this passage compare the "mountain" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and "cannot be hid" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fenced it.</span> So the LXX., the Vulgate, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lowth, Kay. Gesenius, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne prefer to translate, "he dug it over;" while the Revisers of 1885 have suggested, "he made a trench about it." The word occurs only in this place, and has no cognates in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered out the stones</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In the stony soil of Palestine, to collect the surface stones into heaps, or build them into walls, is of primary necessity for the improvement of the land. Conversely the stones were put back, and scattered over the land, by those who wished to "mar" it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Planted it with the choicest vine</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>). The <span class="accented">sorek</span> seems to have been a particular kind of vine, reckoned superior to others. The etymology of the word indicates that it was of a deep red color. <span class="cmt_word">Built a tower</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). Towers had to be built in gardens, orchards, and vineyards, that watch might be kept from them against thieves and marauders (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Made a wine-press</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dug a winepress</span>. The excavation was made to contain a vat, above which was the "press," worked by men, who wrung the liquor out of a great bag containing the grapes. (See the Egyptian rock-paintings, passim, where the operation is represented repeatedly.) <span class="cmt_word">It brought forth wild grapes.</span> The natural, not the cultivated fruit, a worthless product. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-3.htm">Isaiah 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The prophet's "song" here ends, and Jehovah himself takes the word. As if the story told in the parable had been a fact, he calls on the men of Judah and Jerusalem to "judge between him and his vineyard." Compare Nathan's appeal to David by the parable of the ewe lamb (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What could have been done more?</span> Comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>, where God is shown to have done all that was possible to reclaim his people: "Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the <span class="accented">prophets</span>, and all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets;" "And the Lord God of their fathers sent unto them by his <span class="accented">messengers</span>, rising up early, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place: but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, <span class="accented">until there was no remedy</span>." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; <i>and</i> break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now go to; I will tell you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and now</span>, <span class="accented">I pray you</span>, <span class="accented">let me tell yon</span>. The address is still smooth and persuasive up to the word "vineyard." Then there is a sudden change; the style becomes abrupt, the tone fierce and menacing. "Let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: break down its hedge, that it be grazed on; destroy its wall, that it be trampled underfoot," etc. <span class="cmt_word">The hedge... the wall</span>. Vine-yards were usually protected either by a hedge of thorns, commonly of the prickly pear, or else by a wall; but the rabbis say that in some cases, for additional security, they were surrounded by both. God had given his vineyard all the protection possible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will lay it waste</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will make it a desolation</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-19.htm">Isaiah 7:19</a>, where a cognate term occurs). Active ravage is not so much pointed at, as the desolation which comes from neglect. <span class="cmt_word">There shall come up briers and thorns.</span> The natural produce of neglected ground in Palestine (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>). The "thorns and briers" symbolize vices of various kinds, the natural produce of the human soul, if God leaves it to itself. The words are scarcely to be taken literally, though it is probably true that "no country in the world has such variety and abundance of thorny plants as Palestine in its present desolation" (Macmillan, 'Min. of Nat.,' p. 103). <span class="cmt_word">I will also command the clouds</span>. Here at last disguise is thrown off, and the speaker manifestly appears as Jehovah, who can alone "command the clouds." The "rain" intended is probably that of his gracious influences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the vineyard</span>, etc. The full explanation of the parable follows  immediately on the disclosure in ver. 6. The vineyard is "Israel," or rather "Judah;" the fruit expected from it, "judgment and righteousness;" the wild grapes which alone it had produced, "oppression" and the "cry" of the distressed. <span class="cmt_word">His pleasant plan;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">the plant of his delights</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the plantation in which he had so long taken delight. He looked for judgment, etc. Gesenius has attempted to give the verbal antithesis of the Hebrew, which is quite lost in our version - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Er harrete auf Recht, und siehe da Unrecht,<br />Auf Gerechtigkeit, und siehe da Schlechtigkeit."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto them that join house to house, <i>that</i> lay field to field, till <i>there be</i> no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-24.</span> - THE SIX WOES. After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, six sins are particularized as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning. On each of these woe is denounced. Two have special punishments assigned to them (vers. 8-17); the remainder are joined in one general threat of retribution (vers. 18  - 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that join house to house</span>. This is <span class="accented">the first woe</span>. It is pronounced on the greed which leads men to continually enlarge their estates, without regard to their neighbors' convenience. Nothing is said of any use of unfair means, much <span class="accented">less</span> of violence in dispossessing the former proprietors. What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. <span class="cmt_word">Till there be no place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till want of place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till there is no room for others. A hyperbole, doubtless, but marking a real national inconvenience. That they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth; rather, <span class="accented">that ye may dwell by yourselves in the midst of the land</span>. The great landlords wished to isolate themselves; they disliked neighbors; they would fain "dwell by themselves," without neighbors to trouble them. Uzziah seems, by what is said of his possessions (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>), to have been one of the greatest sinners in respect of the accumulation of land. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">In mine ears <i>said</i> the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, <i>even</i> great and fair, without inhabitant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Either something has fallen out in the first clause of this verse, or there is a most unusual ellipse of the verb "<span class="accented">said"</span> which our translators have supplied, very properly. There seems to be nothing emphatic in the words, "on mine ears" (<span class="accented">see</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-14.htm">Isaiah 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-13.htm">Ezekiel 10:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Many houses shall be desolate.</span> The greed of adding house to house will be punished by the death of those who have so sinned, and the extinction of their families, either through war, or through a more direct divine judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath.</span> The greed of adding field to field will he punished by the curse of barrenness, which God will send upon the laud. Dr. Kay-calculates that ten acres (Roman) of vineyard ought to yield upon the average five hundred baths (or four thousand gallons) instead of one bath (eight gallons). <span class="cmt_word">An homer... an ephah.</span> The "ephah" was the tenth-part of a "homer" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>). Corn lands should return only one-tenth part of the seed sown in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, <i>that</i> they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, <i>till</i> wine inflame them!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that... follow strong drink</span>. We have here <span class="accented">the second woe</span>. It is pronounced on drunkenness and revelry. Drunkenness is an infrequent Oriental vice; but it seems to have been one whereto many among the Jews were at all times prone (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-32</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, etc.). Even the priests and the <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> prophets erred through strong drink and were swallowed up of wine" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That rise up early in the morning.</span> Great banquets were held by the "princes" and "nobles," beginning at an early hour (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>), and accompanied by music of an exciting kind (<a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5, 6</a>), which were "<span class="accented">continued</span> until <span class="accented">night</span>," or rather, "into the night" (Revised Version), and terminated in general drunkenness, perhaps in general licentiousness. (See <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27-30</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a> for the connection of inebriety with whoredom.) Two kinds of intoxicating liquor seem to have been consumed at these banquets, viz. ordinary grape wine, and a much stronger drink, which is said to have been "made of dates, pomegranates, apples, honey, barley, and other ingredients," which was known as <span class="accented">shekar</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and is called "strong drink" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Till wine inflame them</span>; or, <span class="accented">the wine inflaming them</span>.

It is difficult to identify the Hebrew instruments of music with modern names; but there seems to be no doubt that the <span class="accented">kinnor</span> was a sort of harp, and the <span class="accented">khalib</span> a sort of pipe. The <span class="accented">nebel</span>, generally rendered by "psaltery," but here and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> by "viol," was a stringed instrument played with the fingers (Josephus); perhaps a lyre, perhaps a sort of dulcimer. The <span class="accented">toph</span>, here translated "tabret," and elsewhere often "timbrel,"  was most likely a tambourine. All four instruments had in the earlier times been dedicated to the worship of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>); now they were employed to inflame men's passions at feasts. <span class="cmt_word">They regard not the work of the Lord</span>. The "work of Jehovah" is his manifestation of himself in history, more especially in the history of his chosen people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, etc.).

"Are gone" or "have gone" is "the perfect of prophetic certainty" (Cheyne). The prophet sees the captivity as a thing that had already taken place. It as an appropriate punishment for drunkenness and revelry to be carried off into servitude, and in that condition to suffer, as slaves so often did, hunger and thirst. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have no knowledge</span>; or, <span class="accented">unawares</span>, <span class="accented">without foreseeing it</span> (so Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Ewald, Delitzsch, Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Their honorable men</span>; literally, <span class="accented">their glory</span>, for "their glorious ones" - the abstract for the concrete. <span class="cmt_word">Are famished</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sons of famine</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "starvelings." <span class="cmt_word">Their multitude</span>; or, <span class="accented">their noisy crowd</span> (Kay) - the "throng of voluptuaries" who frequented the great banquets of vers. 11, 12.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the lambs feed</span>. Dr. Kay takes the "lambs" to be the remnant of Israel that survived the judgment, who will feed freely, cared for by the good Shepherd; but the parallelism so generally affected by Isaiah seems to require a meaning more consonant with the later clause of the verse. Most commentators, therefore, expound the passage literally, "Then shall lambs feed [on the desolated estates of the covetous]" (see vers. 8-10). <span class="cmt_word">After their manner</span>; or, <span class="accented">after their own guidance</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at their pleasure, as they list (so Lowth and Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</span> <span class="accented">Goim</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nomad tribes, shall consume the produce of the wasted fields once possessed by the Hebrew grandees. Ewald proposes to make the verse immediately follow ver. 10; but this is not necessary. The occupation of their lands by wandering tribes, Arabs and others, was a part of the punishment that fell on all the nobles, not on those only who accumulated large estates.

These men are represented as "drawing iniquity with cords of vanity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dragging after them a load of sin by cords that seem too weak; and then as "sinning with a cart-rope," which is a mere variant expression of the same idea. Mr. Cheyne quotes from the Rig-Veda, as a parallel metaphor, the phrase, "Undo the rope of sin."

They walk, not by faith, but by sight. At the bottom of this pretended desire there lies a complete incredulity. <span class="cmt_word">The counsel</span>; or, purpose, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-26.htm">Isaiah 14:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Holy One of Israel.</span> They use one of Isaiah's favorite titles of God (see note on Isaiah L 4), not from any belief in him, but rather in a mocking spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that call evil good.</span> This <span class="accented">is the fourth</span> woe. There are persons who gloss over evil deeds and evil habits by fair-sounding names, who call cowardice caution, and rashness courage,  niggardliness thrift, and wasteful profusion generosity. The same men are apt also to call good evil; they brand prudence with the name of cunning, call meekness want of proper spirit, sincerity rudeness, and firmness obstinacy. This deadness to moral distinctions is the sign of deep moral corruption, and fully deserves to have a special "woe" pronounced against it. <span class="cmt_word">That put darkness for light</span>. "Light" and "darkness" symbolize good and evil throughout Scripture (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, etc.). They are sometimes mere synonyms, as here; but sometimes they express rather the intellectual side of morality. <span class="cmt_word">Bitter for sweet</span>. More symbolism, but of a rarer kind. Jeremiah calls wickedness "bitter" (Jeremiah 2:9; 4:18), and the psalmist calls the judgments of God" sweet" (Psalm 109:103). But the terms are not often used with any moral bearing.

Self-conceit is the antithesis of humility; and as humility is, in a certain sense, the crowning virtue, so self-conceit is a sort of finishing touch put to vice. While a man thinks humbly of himself, there is a chance that he may repent and amend. When he is "wise in his own eyes," he does not see why he should change.

But there is this difference, that the drinkers in the present verse do not succumb to their liquor, or remain at the banquet all day, but proceed to the business of their lives, attend courts and judge causes, but with brain obfuscated and moral vision bedimmed, so that they are easily induced to pervert justice on receipt of a bribe. The sixth woe may be considered to be pronounced rather upon their corruption than upon their drinking, and so to be really quite distinct from the second (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4, 5</a>).

It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or "combination of two figures," the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. <span class="cmt_word">As the fire devoureth the stubble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a tongue of fire eats up stubble</span>. "<span class="accented">Tongue</span> of fire" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in <a href="../../par/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>. But it well depicts the power of fire to lick up clean all that comes in its way. Isaiah elsewhere notes the analogy, making it the foundation of simile (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the flame consumeth the chaff</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and as dry grass sinks down inflame</span>.

The root is the last thing to decay. When that fails, the case is desperate. Judah's "root" did not utterly fail (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>); but the present warning is to individuals and classes (vers. 8, 11, 18, 20-23), not to the nation. <span class="cmt_word">Their blossom shall go up as dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their external glory shall crumble and waste away. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have cast away the Law.</span> All the sins of Israel had this one thing in common - they were transgressions of the Law of God as delivered to them by Moses, and enforced upon them by the prophetical order (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Despised the word</span>; or, <span class="accented">the speech</span>. <span class="accented">Imrah</span> is rarely used by Isaiah.

Hints have been already given that the judgment which is to fall on the nation is a foreign war, or a series of foreign wars (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). But now for the first time a terrible invasion, in which many nations will participate, is clearly announced. At first the imagery is obscure (ver. 25), but it soon grows more distinct. "Nations" are summoned to the attack; a vast army comes, and comes" with speed swiftly" (ver. 26); then their array is described (vers. 27, 28); and finally their ravin is compared to that of lions, and their success in catching and carrying off their prey is prophesied (ver. 29). In the last verse of the chapter the prophet falls back into vaguer imagery, comparing the roar of the invaders to the roaring of the sea, and the desolated land to one seen under the gloom of a preternatural darkness (ver. 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The threats of this verse are all vague and general, for there is no reason to suppose that the phrase," the hills did tremble, "refers to an actual earthquake. That there was an earthquake in the reign of Uzziah is, indeed, clear from <a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; but it was probably a thing of the past when Isaiah wrote this chapter, and he is spiking of the future. A "trembling of the hills" is, in prophetic language, a commotion among the chief men of the land. <span class="cmt_word">He hath stretched forth his hand.</span> Again the "perfect of prophetic certitude." <span class="cmt_word">Their carcasses were torn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">were as refuse</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a>).

The words imply that God's judgment upon Judah will not be a single stroke, but a continuous smiting, covering some considerable space of time.

But "ensigns" or "standards" were in use both among the Egyptians (Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 121.) and among the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 461) before the time of Isaiah, and are, therefore, likely to have been in use among the Hebrews. The standards, however, of this early period were not flags, as Jarchi supposes, but solid constructions of wood or metal, exhibiting some emblem or other. God lifts up his standard to draw the nations together, indicating thereby that they are to fight his battles. <span class="cmt_word">And will hiss</span>. "Hissing" is said to have been practiced by bee-keepers to draw their bees out of the hives in the morning, and bring them home again from the fields at nightfall (Cyril, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.).
