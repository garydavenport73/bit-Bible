It is generally allowed that this prophecy is Messianic; but some critics insist that it is not so "in a narrow sense." They regard Isaiah as expecting Messiah's kingdom to follow immediately on the discomfiture of Sennacherib, and as looking to Hezekiah to inaugurate it. According to this view, Hezekiah, renovated in character, was to be the Messiah, and might have been so had he been "equal to the demands providentially made upon him." But he was not; and the task of establishing the kingdom fell to "another," at a later date. It is simpler to regard the prophet as looking for a greater than Hezekiah (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), but ignorant how soon, or how late, his coming would be. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A king... princes</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "the king... the princes;" but the Hebrew gives no article. The announcement is vague, and corresponds to those of other prophets, as of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), "Behold, the days come that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper;" and of Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion... behold, thy <span class="accented">King</span> cometh unto thee." The "princes" of the text are the minor authorities whom the king would set over his kingdom - i.e., the apostles and their successors. <span class="cmt_word">In righteousness... in judgment</span>. Messiah's rule will be a rule of strict justice and right, offering the strongest contrast to that under which the Jews have been living since the time of Jehoshaphat (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-12</a>, etc.).

The word "he" is emphatic. Unlike the fool, who passively does evil through thoughtlessness, the niggard actively devises crafty plans against his fellow-men. He seeks to cheat the poor out of their rights by false witness (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>, etc.), <span class="cmt_word">Even when the needy speaketh right</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has right on his side."

It might seem at first sight as if we had here a detached utterance of the prophet, accidentally conjoined with the preceding passage (vers. 1-8). But vers. 15-18 furnish a link of connection between the two portions of the chapter, and make it probable that they were delivered at the same time. Mr. Cheyne supposes that the indifference of a knot of women, gathered at some little distance from the men to whom Isaiah had addressed vers. 1-8, provoked the prophet suddenly to turn to them, and speak to them in terms of warning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up</span>. The "careless daughters" are sitting, or reclining upon couches, at their ease. The prophet bids them stand up, to hear a message from God (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye women that are at ease</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that are self-satisfied and self-complacent." The word employed has almost always a bad sense (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hear my voice</span>. This clause should be attached to the first half of the verse. The order of the words in the original is, "Ye women that are at ease, rise up and hear my words; ye careless daughters, hearken unto my speech." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many days and years shall ye</span>  <span class="cmt_word">be troubled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in a year and days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in less than two years." The object of the prophet is not to fix the duration of the trouble, but to mark the time of its commencement (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye be troubled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall ye tremble</span>, or <span class="accented">shudder</span> (so <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye careless women</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye confident ones</span>. The word is different from that employed in vers. 9 and 11. <span class="cmt_word">The vintage shall fail</span>; literally, <span class="accented">has failed -</span> "the perfect of prophetic certitude" (Cheyne). Some critics understand a literal failure, or destruction, of the vintage through the invasion of the Assyrians. Others suggest a refer-once to <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4-7</a>. The vineyard of the Lord (Judah) has utterly failed to bring forth grapes - there is no ingathering - therefore destruction shall fall upon it.

(so the LXX., the Vulgate, Jarchi, Gesenius, Ewald, Maurer, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne). Dr. Kay prefers the rendering of the Authorized Version, understanding by "the teats" such "dry breasts" as Hosea speaks of (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>).

The women require, like the men, to be both warned and comforted, wherefore the prophet addresses to them, as to the men in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>. and 31, an intermixture of threatening (vers. 13, 14) with promise (vers. 15-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briars.</span> This was the punishment with which the unfruitful vineyard was threatened in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>.

If Sennacherib carried off, as he declares (G. Smith, 'Epenym Canon,' p. 134), more than two hundred thousand captives from Judaea, he must have left many houses without inhabitants. The solitude begun by him was completed by the Babylonians. <span class="cmt_word">The joyous city</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>).

The prophet sees in vision Jerusalem deserted by her inhabitants, the grand houses of the rich empty, the strongholds haunted by wild beasts, and the slopes of the hills fed on by sheep, and even occasionally visited by the timid and solitude-loving wild ass. The description suits well the time of the Babylonian captivity, but not any earlier period. Probably it was not revealed to the prophet how soon the condition would be reached. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the city shall be left</span>. The real meaning is, as Bishop Lowth expresses it, "The populous city shall be left desolate." But the whole passage is. as Delitzsch observes, "grammatically strange, the language becoming more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet." <span class="cmt_word">The forts and towers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hill and tower</span>, with (perhaps) a special reference to the part of Jerusalem called Ophel (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, etc.), the long projecting spur from the eastern hill, which points a little west of south, and separates the Kedron valley from the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for dens</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for caves</span>; but dens for wild beasts seem to be meant (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For ever</span>. This expression must not be pressed. Hyperbole is a recognized feature of poetry written under strong excitement. <span class="cmt_word">A joy of wild asses</span>. The wild ass is not now found nearer Palestine than Mesopotamia, or perhaps Northern Syria. It is exceedingly shy, and never approaches the habitations of men.

The expression "until" modifies the previous "forever," showing that the desolation was <span class="accented">not</span> always to continue. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit be poured upon us from on high.</span> An effluence from the Holy Spirit of God on individuals of eminence, prophets, kings, artificers, to fit them for their tasks, is recognized in many of the earlier books of Scripture, and especially in the Davidical psalms. But a general effluence of the Spirit of holiness on a nation, to produce a change of heart, seems to be first announced by Isaiah. The nearly contemporary prophecy of Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28, 29</a>) is, perhaps, as wide in its scope, but limited to the prophetic gift, which is not necessarily conjoined with spiritual-minded-ness or holiness of life. Isaiah, the "evangelical prophet," first teaches that the conversion of a nation is God's work, effected by the Holy Spirit, and effectual to the entire change of the heart of a people. <span class="cmt_word">And the wilderness be a fruitful</span> <span class="cmt_word">field</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the community long cursed with barrenness of good works" (ver. 10) "becomes once more fruitful of them." <span class="cmt_word">And the fruitful field be counted for a forest</span>. An order of climax seems to be here intended. The <span class="accented">midbar</span>, the bare pasturage-ground, becomes a Carmel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> carefully cultivated; the Carmel becomes like Lebanon, a rich and luxurious forest. There is no close parallel between this verse and ver. 17 of <a href="../../par/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. The prophet is not tied down by his previous metaphors.

Peace - a true peace, not a false one (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>) - shall be the result of the reign of righteousness. War, quarrels, enmity, hostile feelings, are all of them the fruit of unrighteousness. In the kingdom of the Messiah, just so far forth as it is thoroughly established, "the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace" (<a href="../../par/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The effect of righteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the service of</span> righteousness, which perhaps means here "the wages of righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Quietness and assurance</span>; or, <span class="accented">quietness and confidence</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>). The final happiness of the blessed in Christ's kingdom is always spoken of as a state of "rest and quietness" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>, etc.). The "confidence" felt would be an assured confidence, not a rash and foolish one, like that of the women of vers. 10, 11.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/32-19.htm">Isaiah 32:19</a></div><div class="verse">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but it shall hail in the coming down</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the destruction) <span class="accented">of the forest</span>. "The forest" has commonly been regarded as Assyria, on the strength of <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>. Mr. Cheyne, however, suggests Judah, or the high and haughty ones of Judah, whose destruction was a necessary preliminary to the establishment of Christ's kingdom. May not God's enemies generally be meant? <span class="cmt_word">The city.</span> Nineveh (Lowth, Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller); Jerusalem (Delitzsch, Knobel, Cheyne, Kay); "the city in which the hostility of the world to Jehovah will, in the latter days, be centralized" (Drechsler, Nagel) - the "world-power," in fact. The last view seems to give the best sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/32-20.htm">Isaiah 32:20</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>are</i> ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth <i>thither</i> the feet of the ox and the ass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters</span>. The idyllic picture, begun in ver. 15, terminates here. The people of the kingdom have a well-watered land (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>), where they live peacefully, sowing their seed beside the water-courses, and having abundant pasture for their peaceful beasts - the ox and the ass (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>). A spiritual meaning doubtless underlies the literal sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
