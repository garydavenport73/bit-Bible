"Ensigns" were used both by the Assyrians and the Egyptians. "Banners," or flags, do not seem to have been employed in the ancient world. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the high mountain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon a bare mountain - one</span> that was clear of trees, so that the signal might be the better seen from it. God's army having to be summoned against Babylon, the summons is made in three ways: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by a signal or ensign lifted up on a high hill; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by a loud call or shout; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by waving or beckoning with the hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole description is, of course, pure metaphor. <span class="cmt_word">That they may go into the gates of the nobles</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, <i>even</i> them that rejoice in my highness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have commanded my sanctified ones</span>. The pronoun "I" is emphatic - "I myself." Not only will an external summons go forth, but God will lay his own orders on them whom he chooses for his instruments, and bid them come to the muster. All who carry out his purposes are, in a certain sense, "sanctified ones" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>, etc.). Here the Modes and Persians are specially in. tended (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">For mine anger</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "for the purpose of executing my anger." <span class="cmt_word">Even them that rejoice in my highness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my proudly exultant ones</span> (Cheyne, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius). AEschylus calls the Persians <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ('Persae,' 1. 827); Herodotus, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> (1. 41). The high spirits, however, natural to gallant soldiers on going out to war, rather than any special haughtiness or arrogancy, are intended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of a multitude in the mountains</span>. I do not know why Isaiah should not have been "thinking of his geography" (Cheyne). As soon as the Greeks knew anything of the Persians, they knew of them as a <span class="accented">mountain</span> people, and attributed their valor and their handy habits to the physical character of their country (Herod., 9. <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.). Jeremiah connects the invading army which destroyed Babylon with mountains, when he derives it from. Ararat (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>), Minni (Armenia), and Ashchenaz (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>). At any rate, the mention of "mountains" here is very appropriate, both Media and Persia being, in the main, mountainous countries. <span class="cmt_word">A great people</span>; or, <span class="accented">much people</span>  - not necessarily of one nation only. The host of the battle; rather, <span class="accented">a host of war</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a multitude of men, armed and prepared for war. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, <i>even</i> the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They come from a far country</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>). Both Media and Persia were "far countries" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, "from the end of heaven" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">The weapons</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:25; 51:20). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy the whole land.</span> Many critics would render <span class="accented">ha-arets</span> by "the earth" here. It may be granted that the language of the prophecy goes beyond the occasion in places (especially vers. 11 and 13), and passes from Babylon to that wicked world of which Babylon is a type; but, where the context permits, it seems better to restrict than to expand the meaning of the words employed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Howl ye; for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>); literally, the expression used in both passages is <span class="accented">a day of Jehovah</span>. The idiom would not, however, allow the use of the article, so that the phrase is ambiguous. "The day of Jehovah" is properly "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient" (Cheyne). But any great occasion when God passes judgment on a nation is called in Scripture "a day of the Lord." "a coming of Christ." And so here the day of the judgment upon Babylon seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span> Isaiah is thought to quote from Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>) here; but perhaps both prophets quoted from an earlier author. Shaddai (equivalent to "Almighty') is an ancient name of God, most rarely used by the prophetical writers (only here, and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>), and never elsewhere by either Isaiah or Joel. It has generally been said to mean "the Strong One;" but recently the theory has found favor that it meant originally "the Sender of storms," from the Arabic <span class="accented">sh'da - jecit</span>, <span class="accented">effudit</span>. However this may be, the word is certainly used in the later times mainly to express God's power to visit and punish, and the present passage might perhaps be best translated, "It shall come as a destruction from the Destroyer (<span class="accented">k'shod mish-Shaddai yabo</span>)." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall all hands be faint</span> (comp.

Recently discovered accounts of the capture of Babylon by Cyrus show a great want of activity and vigor on the part of the defenders. <span class="cmt_word">Every man's heart shall melt</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, etc.). The general inaction will spring from a general despondency. This statement agrees much better with the recently discovered documents than does the statement of Herodotus, that, safe within their walls, the Babylonians despised their assailants, and regarded themselves as perfectly secure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces <i>shall be as</i> flames.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall be afraid;</span> rather, <span class="accented">dismayed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they shall take hold of pangs and sorrows</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>They shall be amazed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">look aghast</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Their faces</span> shall be as <span class="cmt_word">flames</span>.

Here the prophecy certainly goes beyond the destruction of Babylon, and becomes a general warning to the wicked of all court-tries. Each country is to feel that its turn will come. Punishment will fall especially on the unjust, the proud, and the haughty (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-17</a>, etc.).

In general, this sign is mentioned in connection with the end of the world, when a "new heaven and a new earth" are to supersede the old (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). Isaiah may, perhaps, pass here from signs connected with the fall of Babylon to those which will announce the last (lay - each "day of the Lord" being, as already observed, a type of the final and great day (see the comment on ver. 6). Or, possibly, the allusion may be to some "shaking" by God of a supra-mundane kingdom as preliminary to his passing judgment on Babylon (so Dr. Kay; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>).

When a town was taken by assault, they were ruthlessly slaughtered. When spared, it was only to be dragged off as captives, and to become the slaves of their captors in a foreign land. Assyrian sculptures often illustrate this latter practice. Their wives ravished (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>).

Isaiah's knowledge that the Medes should take a leading part in the destruction of Babylon is, no doubt, as surprising a fact as almost any other in the entire range of prophetic foresight, or insight, as set before us in Scripture. The Medes were known to Moses as an ancient nation of some importance (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>); but since his time had been unmentioned by any sacred writer; and, as a <span class="accented">living</span> nation, had only just come within the range of Israelite vision, by the fact that, when Sargon deported the Samaritans from Samaria, he placed some of them "in the cities of the Medes" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The Assyrians had become acquainted with them somewhat more than a century earlier, and had made frequent incursions into their country, finding them a weak and divided people, under the government of a large number of petty chiefs. Sargon had conquered a portion of the tribes, and placed prefects in the cities; at the same time planting colonists in them from other parts of the empire. That, when the weakness of Media was being thus made apparent, Isaiah should have foreseen its coming greatness can only be accounted for by his having received a Divine communication on the subject. Subsequently, he had a still more exact and complete communication (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not regard silver</span>. The Medes were not a particularly disinterested people; but in the attack on Babylon, made by Cyrus, the object was not plunder, but conquest and the extension of dominion. The main treasures of Babylon - those in the great temple of Bolus - were not carried off by Cyrus, as appears both from his own inscriptions, and from Herodotus (1. 181-183). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Their</i> bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their bows</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9, 14</a>). Both the Medes and the Persians were skilled archers. Herodotus tells us that every Persian youth was taught three things  - "to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth" (1. 136). At Persepolis, Modes and Persians are alike represented as carrying bows and quivers. AEschyius regards the contest between the Persians and the Greeks as one between the arrow and the spear ('Persae,' 11. 135, 136). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Babylon, the glory of kingdoms</span>. The "<span class="accented">glory"</span> of Babylon consisted: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> In her antiquity.

As time went on, she grew in wealth and splendor. Perhaps it was granted to Isaiah to see her in ecstatic vision, not merely such as she was in the time of Sargon under Merodach-Baladan, but such as she became under Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of her kings, who raised her to the highest pitch or glory and eminence. The beauty of the Chaldees' excellency. The Kaldi appear to have been originally one of the many tribes by which Babylonia was peopled at an early date, From the expression, "Ur of the Chaldees," which occurs more than once in Genesis (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28, 31</a>), we may gather that they were inhabitants of the more southern part of the country, near the coast. The same conclusion may be drawn from the Assyrian inscriptions, especially those of Shalmaneser II. - the Black Obelisk king. The term never became a general name for the Babylonian people among themselves or among the Assyrians; but, somehow-or other, it was accepted in that sense by the Jews, and is so used, not only by Isaiah, but also by the writers of Kings and Chronicles, by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. <span class="cmt_word">As when God overthrew Sodom</span>.

This part of the prophecy did not receive its fulfillment till many centuries had gone by. From the time of Cyrus to that of Alexander the Great, Babylon was one of the chief cities of the Persian empire. Alexander was so struck with it, and with the excellence of its situation, that he designed to make it his capital. It first began seriously to decline under the Seleucidae, who built Seleucia on the Tigris as a rival to it, and still further injured it by fixing the seat of government at Antioch. But it had still a large population in the first century after our era (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 18:9, &sect; 8); and is mentioned as a place of some consequence in the time of Trajan (Die Cass., 68:27), and even in that of Severue (Die Cass., 75:9). But after this it went rapidly to decay. Under the Sassuntans it disappears from sight; and when Benjamin of Tudela, in the twelfth century, visited the spot, there was nothing to be seen of the mighty city but those ruins of the Kasr, or palace, which still arrest the traveler's attention. The site had become, and has ever since remained, "without inhabitant." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there.</span> A superstitious feeling prevents the Arabs from encamping on the mounds of Babylon, which are believed to be the haunts of evil spirits (Rich, 'First Memoir on Babylon,' p. 67; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 371). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</span> The nitrous soil of the Babylonian mounds allows them to produce nothing but the coarsest and most unpalatable vegetation. The shepherds consequently do not feed their flocks on them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a></div><div class="verse">But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wild beasts of the desert shall lie there</span>. It is not quite clear what particular wild beasts are intended. Those actually noted on the site of Babylon are lions, jackals, and porcupines.  These sometimes make their lairs in the ruins (Rich, 'First Memoir,' p. 69; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 342). <span class="cmt_word">Doleful creatures</span>; in the original, <span class="accented">okhim</span>. What animal is meant we cannot say, as the word occurs only in this passage. Mr. Cheyne translates it by "hyenas." <span class="cmt_word">Owls shall dwell there</span>; literally, <span class="accented">daughters of the owl</span> (as in <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-16.htm">Leviticus 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-15.htm">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>). Mr. Rich says, "In most of the cavities of the Babil Mound there are numbers of owls and bats." Sir A. Layard," A large grey owl is found in great numbers, frequently in flocks of nearly a hundred, in the low shrubs among the ruins of Babylon" ('Nin. and Bab.,' p. 484, note). <span class="cmt_word">Satyrs shall dance there.</span> The word translated "satyr" is, etymologically, "hairy one," and ordinarily means "a goat."  Some have supposed "wild goats" to be here intended, but they are not found in Babylonia. The translation "satyr" is defended by many, who think Isaiah might draw upon current beliefs for some features of his description. Dr. Kay gives "baboons," since the Moko - a kind of baboon - is known in Babylonia.
