It is remarkable that the people <span class="accented">ask</span> for instruction. Though they do not keep the law, they have a yearning after it. They are not contented with their existing condition, but desire better things, and they have an instinctive feeling that to hear God's word will help them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the priest brought the law</span>. Ezra, God's true priest, at once responded to the call He did not say, "The law is difficult, hard to be understood, might mislead you, should be reserved for the learned;" but at once "brought it," and "read therein" <span class="cmt_word">before the congregation both of men and women, and of all that could hear with understanding</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of all (youths and maidens) that were old enough to understand the words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he read therein before the street that <i>was</i> before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people <i>were attentive</i> unto the book of the law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the morning until midday</span>. Or, "from daylight." He began as soon as it was light enough, and read on (he and his assistants - ver. 7) till noon, that is, for six hours or more. The reading appears to have been varied by occasional exposition (vers. 7, 8). <span class="cmt_word">The ears of all the people were attentive</span>. Though there is no word in the Hebrew for "attentive," yet the meaning is quite correctly given: "the ears of all the people were to the book" &Ntilde; fixed on that, and on nothing else. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ezra...  stood upon a pulpit of wood</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>, where, however, the term used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, "stand," and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;</span>, "tower." In either case an elevated platform seems to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Mattithiah, and Shema</span>. These persons are commonly supposed to have been priests, but there is nothing to prove it. They need not even have been Levites, since they were there not to teach, but only to do honour to Ezra. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the people stood up</span>. The Jews commonly sat to hear and stood up to pray; but in hearing they occasionally stood up, to do greater honour to the person or the occasion (see <a href="../../par/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>). It is not to be supposed that they stood during the whole of the six hours that Ezra's reading lasted.

Ezra began by an ascription of praise to Jehovah, as the Levites, probably under his direction, begin in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-5.htm">Nehemiah 9:5</a>, and as David began his last address to the congregation (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The great God</span>. The epithet belongs to the writer rather than to Ezra himself, who in his own book never uses it. It recurs in this section (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>), and is also employed by Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Amen, Amen</span>. The repetition marks intensity of feeling, as does the <span class="cmt_word">lifting up their hands</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-21.htm">Luke 23:21</a>; and for the lifting up of the hands, so natural in prayer, see <a href="../../par/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.

The term "Tirshatha" had previously been applied only to Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a>), but it was applicable to any governor. The writer of the section, introducing Nehemiah here for the first time, naturally gives him a title of reverence. Nehemiah's modesty had made him content to describe himself by the general and comparatively weak term <span class="accented">pechah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Said unto the people...  Mourn not</span>. A combined remonstrance is made against the open grief of the people by the civil and ecclesiastical rulers, and by the order of Levites. Mourning was unsuitable for a day of high festivity, the opening day of the civil year and of the sabbatical month, itself a sabbath or day of rest, and one to be kept by blowing of trumpets (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>).

"The stranger, the fatherless, and the widow" should have their part in the feast (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>).

Once let the sweetness of the Divine word be tasted and appreciated, and there springs up in the heart instantly a desire for more - a wish to continue in the study - a feeling like that of the Psalmist when he said, "Lord, what love have I unto thy law: <span class="accented">all the day long</span> is my study in it" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>). The Jews, taught by Ezra in the law of God on the first day of the month, return to him on the second, desirous of hearing more, hungering and thirsting after the word of life, of which they have felt the power and the excellency. <span class="cmt_word">To understand</span>.

The practice of "dwelling in booths," commanded in <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42</a>, had fallen into disuse, probably during the captivity, and though the feast itself had been revived by Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>), yet this feature of it, from which it derived its name, had remained in abeyance. <span class="cmt_word">In the feast of the seventh month</span>. Though the "feast of trumpets" was also a feast of the seventh month, that of tabernacles was "the feast," being one of those which all Israelites not reasonably hindered were bound to attend (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>), and which was placed on a par with the Passover and Pentecost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as <i>it is</i> written.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that they should publish</span>. See <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saying,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Go forth</span>, etc. These words are not found in any existing Scripture, and some corruption of the present text may therefore be suspected. The Septuagint interposes, between "Jerusalem" and "Go forth," the words "And Esdras said," which would remove the difficulty; but it is difficult to understand how Ezra's name should have fallen out. Perhaps Houbigant is right in his suggestion of an emendation, by which the verse would run thus:  -  "And when they heard it, they proclaimed in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth," etc. Into the mountain. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the neighbouring mountain, the Mount of Olives. <span class="cmt_word">Pine branches</span>. Rather "<span class="accented">oleaster</span> branches." <span class="cmt_word">Branches of thick trees</span>. The same expression is used in <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, the meaning in each place being uncertain. Perhaps trees with thick, viscous leaves are intended. It is remark- able that two of the trees commanded in Leviticus are omitted, viz., the hadar and the "willow of the brook," while three not mentioned in Leviticus - the olive, oleaster, and myrtle - are added. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a></div><div class="verse">So the people went forth, and brought <i>them</i>, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The flat roofs of Oriental houses, and the court round which they were commonly built, furnished convenient sites for the booths, and would be preferred by the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The incomers from the country districts (ver. 15) would have to occupy the open places or "squares" of the city, and the temple courts, which would accommodate large numbers. On the <span class="cmt_word">street of the water gate</span> see the comment on ver. 1. The <span class="cmt_word">street of the gate of Ephraim</span> was probably a similar <span class="accented">square</span>, inside the great northern gateway.

"<span class="accented">Jeshua"</span> and "Joshua" are two modes of contracting the full name of Jehoshua, the latter prevalent in early, the former in later times. The Grecised form of Jeshua was "Jesus" (see <a href="../../par/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>). When it is said that since the days of Jeshua <span class="cmt_word">had not the children of Israel done so</span>, we must understand, not that there had been no celebration of the feast of tabernacles since that time - not even that there had been no celebration accompanied by "dwelling in booths," but only that there had been <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">such joyous and general</span> celebration of the festival (comp. what is said in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a> of the passover kept in Josiah's eighteenth year).

Ezra must be intended in the form "he read," though there has been no mention of him since verse 13. The continuous and systematic reading seems to imply that the year was a Sabbatical one, and that the rehearsal commanded in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a> now took place. The observance was perhaps a new thing to the newly-formed community, and is therefore recorded with so much emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">They kept the feast seven days</span>.
