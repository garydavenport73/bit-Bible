The introduction of the conjunction "and" here, and here only, in this list separates off very markedly the last six names from the first sixteen. A similar division is made in ver. 19. The reason for the division seems to be that these last six courses, though including some of the very highest priestly families, as those of Joiarib and Jedaiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-10.htm">Nehemiah 11:10</a>), for some reason or other, did not seal to the covenant, whereas the other sixteen courses did so. <span class="cmt_word">Jedaiah</span>. The double occurrence of this name (in vers. 6 and 7) would naturally raise a suspicion of corruption; but the two Jedaiahs are confirmed by vers. 19, 21.

LIST OF THE HIGH PRIESTS FROM JESHUA TO JADDUA (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>). That this is the line of descent in the high priestly family of the time sufficiently appears both from the names themselves, and from the position assigned to those who bore them in vers. 22, 23, 26. Whether all of them actually exercised the high priest's office is left uncertain in Scripture, but satisfactorily established by Josephus. The six names cover a space of at least 205 years - from the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus,  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, to the submission of Jerusalem to Alexander the Great,  <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, which gives very long generations, but still such as are historically possible. Jeshua was certainly high priest from  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span>. He may have been succeeded by his son, Joiakim, about  <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>. Joiakim had certainly been succeeded by his son, Eliashib, before  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>); and Eliashib was probably succeeded by Joiada about  <span class="date">B.C. 420</span>. Joiada's high priesthood may be assigned to the period between  <span class="date">B.C. 420</span> and 380; Jonathan's to that between  <span class="date">B.C. 380</span> and 350. Jaddua might then hold the dignity from  <span class="date">B.C. 350</span> to 330, or later, and so be brought into contact with Alexander the Great. It is questioned whether in that case Nehemiah can have written the present passage, and certain that he cannot have done so unless he lived to be at least 131 years of age. As this is exceedingly improbable, it is best to suppose, either that the whole list was placed here by Malachi, or at any rate that that prophet added the clause, "and Jonathan begat Jaddua." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshua</span>. The "Jeshua" of ver. 1, not of ver. 8 - the high priest of Zerub-babel's time (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Begat Joiakim</span>. The high priesthood of Joiakim falls into the interval between the first part (chs. 1-7.) and the second part (chs. 7-10.) of Ezra. He is only mentioned in this chapter (vers. 12, 26). <span class="cmt_word">Eliashib</span> is first mentioned in <a href="../../par/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>, but he does not appear as high priest until after Nehemiah reaches Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>).

Josephus, who calls him "Jannseus" (  =   John), says that he murdered his own brother, Jeshua, in the temple, because he was endeavouring to supplant him in the high priesthood through the influence of the Persians. <span class="cmt_word">Jaddua</span> is mentioned as high priest at the time of Alexander's entrance into Jerusalem by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:8, &sect; 5) and Eusebius ('Chron. Can.,' 2. p. 346). The story of Alexander's having previously seen him in a dream is not generally credited. He is said to been high priest for twenty years, and to have outlived Alexander. LIST OF THE HEADS OF THE PRIESTLY COURSES IN THE TIME OF THE HIGH PRIEST JOIAKIM (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a>). Joiakim must have been contemporary with Xerxes, and consequently have been high priest at the time when the very existence of the Jewish people was threatened by Haman. It is curious that we have no record of his high priesthood, nor of the condition of the Palestinian Jews at the time, beyond the slight hints furnished by this chapter. These hints seem to imply that under him special attention was paid to the formation of lists, especially of the chief priests and Levites, and that the temple service was celebrated with great exactness and regularity (vers. 24-26). The present list is particularly valuable, as enabling us to check that with which the chapter opens, and as establishing the <span class="accented">family</span> character of the names whereof that list is made up. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of Seraiah, Meraiah</span>. It will be observed that the family names of the priestly, courses follow the order of the same names in vers. 1-7, and exactly accord with them, excepting in minute differences of spelling, and in one omission - that of the name of "Hattush.' It might be supposed that the family of Hattush had died out; but this is contradicted by its reappearance among the signatures to the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-4.htm">Nehemiah 10:4</a>); the omission here would therefore appear to be accidental.

The conjunction "and' occurring here, exactly as it does in ver. 6, once only in the whole list, and before the same name, shows that the two documents (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7, 12-21</a>) are from the same hand. That the hand is that of Nehemiah, or a contemporary, seems to follow from the fact that no reason can be assigned for the division, or for the low place in the lists of the names Joiarib and Jedaiah, except the failure of these families to set their seals to the covenant (see the comment on ver. 6). PARENTHETIC STATEMENT OF THE TIME DOWN TO WHICH EXACT LISTS OF THE LEADING PRIESTS AND LEVITES WERE KEPT (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22, 23</a>). These verses appear to constitute a late insertion. They interrupt the list of high church officers in the time of Joiakim, which is commenced in ver. 12 and not concluded till ver. 26. By their mention of Jaddua as high priest, and of "Darius the Persian" as contemporary king, they betray a writer who lived at least as late as  <span class="date">B.C. 336</span>, or nearly a century after the time of Nehemiah's religious reforms. The facts put on record by this writer are not of very much importance. They seem to be simply these: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the practice of accurately recording the heads of the priestly and Levitical courses, which Nehemiah has noted as belonging to the days of Joiakim, was continued under his successors, Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, down (at any rate) to the accession of Darius Codomannus; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That in the case of the Levites the lists were inserted into the book of the chronicles - not our "Book," but that larger one, of which ours is in the main an abbreviation - down to the time of Johanan, the son (or, rather, grandson) of Eliashib. It has been supposed that the writer originally accompanied these statements with lists that have been lost, but this does not appear to be probable.

But this is unlikely, since there was nothing to recall that unimportant personage to the thoughts of the writer. Others, with better reason, suggest a tacit allusion to the transfer of empire from Persia to Macedon, and think the date of the passage must be subsequent to  <span class="date">B.C. 331</span>, when the kingdom passed away from Persia

That family, rather than personal, names are here intended is sufficiently shown in the final summary of ver. 26, since the same individuals cannot have flourished under Joiakim (B.C. 490-460)and also under Nehemiah (B.C. 444-430). The actual names - Jeshua, Kadmiel, Hashabiah, Shersbiah, etc. - are all found as family names.

DEDICATION OF THE WALL OF JERUSALEM UNDER NEHEMIAH AND EZRA, WITH NEHEMIAH'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE TEMPLE OFFICERS, AND HIS EFFORTS FOR THE REFORM OF RELIGION (CH. 12:27-47, AND CH. 13.). DEDICATION OF THE WALL (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>). It is supposed by some that the author has here departed from the chronological order, and gone back to a date not much subsequent to the completion of the wall in September,  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, since the dedication of a work under ordinary circumstances follows closely upon its accomplishment. But no reason has been shown for the actual place held by the narrative in the Book upon this supposition, nor is it easy to imagine that the author would have separated the dedication of the wall from its completion by five chapters and a half, unless they had been separated in fact by an interval of some duration. The interval seems, by the notes of time contained in chs. 12, 13, to have been one of nearly thirteen <span class="accented">years.</span> Nehemiah's religious reforms were certainly subsequent to the visit that he paid to the Persian court in  <span class="date">B.C. 432</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>). These reforms grew out of a reading of the law which took place at the time when Nehemiah appointed the temple officers (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>), and that appointment followed closely on the dedication (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>). We may account for the long delay by supposing that Nehemiah was afraid of offending Artaxerxes if he ventured on a ceremony, to which the superstition of the surrounding heathen may have attached extreme importance, without his express permission, and that to obtain this permission his personal influence was necessary. The dedication of a city wall was, so far as we know, a new thing in Israel; but it had been customary from a remote time to dedicate houses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>); and natural piety extended this practice to aggregations of houses, and to the limit or fence by which they were practically made one. The priestly order had shown its sense of the fitness of such a consecration when they raised their portion of the wall, and had at once "sanctified it" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Nehemiah now, by the ceremony which he planned and carried out, placed the whole circuit of the wall under the Divine protection, confessing in this solemn act the intrinsic worthlessness of mere walls and bulwarks, unless God lends them strength and makes them a protection against enemies.

Nehemiah caused all the chiefs of the nation, both lay and clerical, to mount upon the wall, and there marshalled them into two companies, composed of clergy and laity intermixed, one of which he placed under the direction of Ezra (ver. 36), while of the other he took the command himself (ver. 38). The place of assemblage must have been some portion of the western wall, probably the central portion, near the modern Jaffa gate. From this Ezra's company proceeded southward, and then eastward, along the southern wall, while Nehemiah's marched northward, and then eastward, along the northern wall, both processions meeting midway in the eastern wall, between the "water" and the "prison" gates. <span class="cmt_word">Toward the dung gate</span>.

David had inaugurated the "tabernacle" which he made for the ark of the covenant at Jerusalem with sacrifice (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), and had consecrated the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite in the same way (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>). Solomon, at his dedication of the temple, had sacrificed sheep and oxen "that could not be numbered for multitude" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-5.htm">1 Kings 8:5</a>). Zerubbabel had followed this example at the dedication of the second temple (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>); and we may presume that it was with victims that Eliashib and his brethren the priests had "sanctified" their portion of the wall soon after they completed it (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Nehemiah now completed the dedication of the entire circuit of the walls by sacrifices on a large scale. <span class="cmt_word">God had made them rejoice with great joy</span>. It is characteristic of Nehemiah to ascribe the universal joy, which another might well have claimed as his own work, to the Divine mercy and forethought, which had brought the matter of the wall to a prosperous and happy issue. <span class="cmt_word">The wives also and the children rejoiced</span>. It is seldom that the Jewish women are mentioned as taking that prominent position in joy, which naturally belonged to them in sorrow (<a href="../../par/judges/11-40.htm">Judges 11:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>, etc.).

NEHEMIAH'S ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TEMPLE SERVICE, AND APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-47</a>). The good resolutions of the people at the time of the renewal of the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-28.htm">Nehemiah 10:28-39</a>) would have borne comparatively little fruit had they not been seconded and rendered effective by formal action on the part of the civil authority. The people, in the first flush of their zeal, had bound themselves to undertake the conveyance of the tithes, firstfruits, and free-will offerings from the country districts to Jerusalem, and the deposition of them in the temple treasuries (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37-39</a>). But in practice this was found too great a burthen (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>). Nehemiah therefore appointed special officers to collect the tithes and other dues throughout the entire territory, and to bring them to Jerusalem, and lay them up in the proper chambers (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>). Over the chambers he appointed treasurers, whose duty it was, not only to collect the ecclesiastical dues, but also to distribute the proceeds among the individuals entitled to share in them (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Nehemiah 13:13</a>). Having in this way provided for the sustenance of the clerical body, he was able to insist on their regular performance of all their duties; and the success of his arrangements was such, that under him the temple service was restored, not merely to the condition established by Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a>), but to one not markedly different from that which had been attained in the time of David and Asaph (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 46). The priests, Levites, singers, and porters respectively performed their duties to his satisfaction, purifying themselves, and taking the service in their turns, "according to the commandment of David and Solomon" (ibid. ver. 45).
