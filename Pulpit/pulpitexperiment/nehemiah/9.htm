It was not fitting that these aliens should take part in a ceremony of which the main object was that the special people of God should renew their covenant with him. <span class="cmt_word">Stood and confessed.</span> Attitude is perhaps scarcely intended here, since the Jews confessed their sins kneeling (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>), or prostrate (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>).

The day and the night were alike divided by the Jews into four parts, each of three hours duration.

Compare <a href="../../par/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a> and Isaiah 27:16. In the latter passage the phrase used is almost identical. <span class="cmt_word">The heaven of heavens</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>.

Still, it must be remembered that, according to H.S. (<a href="../../par/psalms/148-3.htm">Psalm 148:3</a>), even the stars "praise" God. <span class="cmt_word">Thou preservest them all.</span> The preservation of all created things by him who called them into being is scarcely taught in the Old Testament elsewhere than in this passage. The Psalmist says in one place, "Thou preservest man and beast" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>); but this acknowledgment falls very far short of the universality of the present passage. Man naturally, but foolishly, fancies that things once created are able to preserve themselves. Exact thought sees, that if all things have been produced <span class="accented">from nothing</span>, it requires precisely the same power to sustain as originally to produce them. Hence "<span class="accented">preservation"</span> has been called "a continual creation."

God's dealings with his people furnished a moral lesson of extraordinary force, and moral teachers, naturally, made frequent reference to them. But it is not often that we have so complete and elaborate a recapitulation as the present, which, beginning with the call of Abraham, brings the history down to the time of the Persian servitude. God's goodness and his people's ingratitude form the burthen of the whole. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-8.htm">Nehemiah 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give <i>it, I say</i>, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou <i>art</i> righteous:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Canaanites</span>, etc. The nations driven out were actually <span class="accented">seven</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>), but it is a common figure of speech to put the part for the whole. In the present enumeration the Hivites are omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Hast performed thy words.</span> Though for a time remnants of the accursed nations were left in the land, "to prove Israel" (<a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1</a>), yet ultimately all were either driven out or reduced to the condition of slaves (see the comment on Ezra 2:55). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-9.htm">Nehemiah 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;</div><div class="comm">

So didst thou get thee a name, as <i>it is</i> this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They dealt proudly</span>. The "proud dealing" of the Egyptians is spoken of in <a href="../../par/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>. That God "got himself a name" by the signs and wonders shown in Egypt is often declared (see <a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>, etc.).

This phrase is taken from the "song of Moses" (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-5.htm">Exodus 15:5</a>). The composer of the address has also in his mind <a href="../../par/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>. The epithet given to the "waters" is not, however, the same, as might appear from the A.V. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-12.htm">Nehemiah 9:12</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</div><div class="comm">

The repetition of the epithets here shows the composer of the form to be penetrated with the spirit of admiration for God's commandments which breathes so remarkably through the whole of <a href="../../par/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-14.htm">Nehemiah 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Madest known unto them thy holy sabbath</span>. The anterior existence of the sabbath to the law is here implied, which accords with <a href="../../par/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2, 3</a>, and <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Precepts, statutes, and laws</span>.

The manna had been already called the "bread of heaven" (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>) and the "corn of heaven" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>) by the national psalmists. The composer of this prayer now for the first time calls it "bread <span class="accented">from</span> heaven"- a phrase consecrated to Christians by its employment in <a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. (vers. 32, 51, 58).

Several MSS. have <span class="accented">b'Mitzraim</span> for <span class="accented">b'Miryam</span>, which would give the sense "appointed a captain to return to their bondage in Egypt." So the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Appointed a captain</span>. The reference is to <a href="../../par/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>, where we are told that the Israelites "said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt." The Levites speak as if the appointment had been made, perhaps regarding the intention as morally equivalent to the act. <span class="cmt_word">A God ready to pardon</span>. Literally, "a God of pardons." The word used is a rare one, occurring only in <a href="../../par/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, besides the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness</span>. This is quoted from <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, which is perhaps a conscious reproduction of <a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>.

The Levites must have known that Sihon was king of Heshbon, and (if the text is sound) must have expressed themselves as they did, by way of rhetorical amplification; perhaps, however, the <span class="accented">van</span> after "Sihon" is the mistake of a copyist.

The ten tribes for 260 years from the revolt of Jeroboam, the remaining two tribes for 135 years longer. <span class="cmt_word">Testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy prophets</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>, where the phrase used is nearly the same, and see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</a>. There was a continual succession of prophets from the time of Solomon to, and through, the captivity. Besides those whose writings have come down to us, we find mention of Ahijah the Shilonite, Iddo the seer, Shemaiah the prophet, Hanani, Jehu the son of Hanani, Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah the son of Imlah, Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, Huldah, and (perhaps) Hosai. The guilt of the Jewish people was enormously increased by the fact that <span class="cmt_word">they would not give ear</span> to the exhortations constantly addressed to them by the messengers of God. Therefore they were delivered into the hands of the heathen, or people of the lands.

Compare <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Who keepest covenant and mercy</span>. This phrase, which occurs also in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, has apparently been derived from the Psalmist's words - "My <span class="accented">mercy</span> will I <span class="accented">keep</span> for him for evermore, and my <span class="accented">covenant</span> shall stand fast with him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the trouble</span>. Literally, "the weariness;" but the word is clearly used here for "suffering" generally. <span class="cmt_word">Since the time of the kings of Assyria</span>. The kings of Assyria, in the strictest sense of the word, had been God's original instrument for punishing his rebellious people. A king not mentioned in Holy Scripture tells us that he defeated Ahab, and forced Jehu to pay him tribute. Another (Pul) took tribute from Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19, 20</a>). A third (Tiglath. Pfieser) carried two tribes and a half into captivity (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). A fourth (Shalmaneser) laid siege to Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and a fifth (Sargon) took it. A sixth (Sennacherib) took all the fenced cities of Judah from Hezekiah, and forced him to buy the safety of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>). A seventh (Esar-haddon) had Manasseh brought as a prisoner to Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). Hence Isaiah calls the Assyrian monarch "the rod of God's anger" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).

See above, ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">The large and fat land</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>.

The amount paid by Judaea is not known; but Syria, in which Judaea was included, paid annually in money 350 talents of silver (Herod. 3:91), or about &pound;90,000. There was also a further contribution in kind. <span class="cmt_word">They have dominion over our bodies</span>. They can impress us either as soldiers or sailors, and make us fight their battles for them.

Sometimes each party to the contract stamped his seal upon a separate piece of sealing clay, which he then attached to the document by means of a string (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 154).
