"He," says Pelagius, "receives the grace of God in vain who, in the new covenant, is not himself new." If you really are in Christ you must show that you have thereby become "a new creation" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).

What the grace of God is meant to effect is sketched in <a href="../../par/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11, 12</a>.

No doubt St. Paul meant that, as long as life lasts, the door of repentance is never absolutely closed; but it is probable that he had specially in view the nearness of the advent of Christ.

The word here is not <span class="accented">skandalon</span>, which is so often rendered "offence," but <span class="accented">proskope</span>, which occurs here alone in the New Testament, and is not found in the LXX.

But of the five scourgings with Jewish whips not one is mentioned in the Acts, and only one of the three scourgings with Roman rods (<a href="../../par/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>). Nothing, therefore, is more clear than that the Acts only furnishes us with a fragmentary and incomplete record, in which, as we gather from the Epistles, either the agonies of St. Paul's lifelong martyrdom are for some reason intentionally minimized, or else (which is, perhaps, mere probable) St. Paul was, as his rule and habit, so reticent about his own sufferings in the cause of Christ that St. Luke was only vaguely, if at all, aware of many scenes of trial through which he had passed. <span class="cmt_word">In imprisonments.</span> St. Paul was frequently in prison, but St. Luke only tells us of one of these occasions (<a href="../../par/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>) - at Philippi; the Roman imprisonment and that at Caesarea were <span class="accented">subsequent</span> to this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">In tumults.</span> These were a normal incident of St. Paul's life, both up to this time and for years afterwards (<a href="../../par/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-28.htm">Acts 19:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-39</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-42.htm">Acts 27:42</a>, etc.) The word <span class="accented">akatastasiai</span> might also mean "insecurities," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> homelessness, wanderings, uncertainties (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>); but New Testament usage seems decisive in favour of the frowner meaning (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="../../par/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>).

Hence he again refers to this in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>. His "sleeplessness" was sometimes the necessary result of labours "night and day" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In fastings.</span> St. Paul never inculcates the practice of voluntary fasting as a duty (for the reading in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a> is more than dubious); but it is probable that he found it personally useful at times (<a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>).

He appeals to the unreserved freedom with which he has written as a reason why they should treat him with the same frank love. <span class="cmt_word">Our heart is enlarged.</span> After writing the foregoing majestic appeal, he felt that he had disburdened his heart, and as it were made room in it to receive the Corinthians unreservedly, in spite of all the wrongs which some of them had done him (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>, 27). On the antithesis of the <span class="accented">mouth</span> and the <span class="accented">heart</span>, see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>.

(For the verb, see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Ye are straitened in your own bowels;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in your own hearts</span>. Any tightening or pressure of the feelings which should exist between us rises solely from your own hearts. Enlarge and open them, as I have done, and we shall once more love each other aright. The verb has already occurred in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a> ("distressed"). <span class="accented">Your own bowels</span>. It is to be regretted that the Authorized Version adopted the meaningless and often rather incongruous word "bowels" for the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> used in its Hebraic sense of "feelings," "affections"  (<a href="../../par/songs/5-4.htm">Song of Solomon 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>). This literalism is always out of place, and especially in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7, 12, 20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-13.htm">2 Corinthians 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <i>my</i> children,) be ye also enlarged.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now, for a recompense in the same.</span> He begs them to give him "a reward in kind;" in other words, he wishes them to be as frank with him as he has been to them. <span class="cmt_word">As unto my children.</span> And therefore, as a spiritual father, I may surely ask for sympathy. St. Paul uses the same metaphor in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Be ye also enlarged.</span> Treat me as I have treated you (comp.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</span> Ewald, followed by Dean Stanley, Holsten, and others, thinks that here there is a sudden dislocation of the argument, and some have even supposed that the section, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1</a>, is either an after thought written by the apostle on the margin of the Epistle after it was finished; or even an interpolation. The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word "Belial," and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8-10</a>.). "Unequally yoked" is a metaphor derived from <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, and is the opposite of "<span class="accented">true yoke fellow"</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What fellowship;</span> literally, <span class="accented">participation</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unrighteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lawlessness</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It was a special mark of heathen life (<a href="../../par/romans/7-19.htm">Romans 7:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Light with darkness.</span> This antithesis is specially prominent in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9-11</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 13</a>, and in the writings of St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; 1 John, <span class="accented">passim</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">harmony</span> or <span class="accented">accord</span>. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. The adjective <span class="accented">sumphonos</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Christ with Belial</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>), <span class="accented">Belial</span>. Here used in the form <span class="accented">Beliar</span>, as a proper name, because no Greek word ends in the letter <span class="greek">&#x3c4;</span>. In the Old Testament it does not stand for a person, but means "wickedness" or "worthlessness." Thus in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a> "a naughty person" is <span class="accented">adam belial</span>. "A son of Belial" means "a child of wickedness" by a common Hebraism (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>). And hence, since Belial only became a proper name in later days - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"To him no temples rose,<br />No altars smoked."</span> Perhaps, as has been conjectured, this clause, which contains two such unusual words, may be a quotation. It is, however, no ground of objection that Belial does not occur elsewhere in St. Paul, for until the pastoral Epistles he only uses <span class="accented">diabolos</span> twice (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-27.htm">Ephesians 4:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What part,</span> etc.?
