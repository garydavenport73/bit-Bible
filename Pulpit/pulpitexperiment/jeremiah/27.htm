The Syriao substitutes for, "Jehoiakim" "Zedekiah," to bring the passage into conformity with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>, where the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah is expressly mentioned. But is this emendation sufficient? Can the fourth year be called the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah," When that reign lasted altogether only eleven years? Is it not probable that the transcriber has inadvertently copied the heading of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>, which corresponds verbally with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-1.htm">Jeremiah 27:1</a>, except that "unto Jeremiah" is wanting? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thee bends and yokes</span>; rather, bands <span class="accented">and poles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bands which secured the two pieces of wood placed respectively above and beneath the neck of the ox, so forming a yoke. Hence, in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, we find the phrase, "the poles [Authorized Version wrongly, 'the bands'] of your yoke." It is clear from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that this account is to be taken literally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And send them</span>, etc. The letter of the text certainly suggests that Jeremiah actually delivered a separate yoke to each of the five ambassadors. Some commentators, however, finding such an act almost incredible, suppose the statement to be allegorical, and the "sending of the yoke" to mean the declaration of the subjection of the nations to Nebuchadnezzar which follows, somewhat as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> the "causing all the nations to drink "means the utterance of a prophecy of woe to the various peoples concerned. But we can hardly pronounce upon this passage by itself. We have to consider whether a whole group of similar statements is or is not to be taken literally. It may be enough to instance <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which are come</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-4.htm">Jeremiah 27:4</a></div><div class="verse">And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a></div><div class="verse">I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <i>are</i> upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - Jehovah is the Creator and Proprietor of the earth and all that is therein. Therefore he can give any part of it to whomsoever he will. Therefore, Jeremiah being his trustworthy prophet, the kings are called upon to take notice that Jehovah has transferred their kingdoms to Nebuchadnezzar. Observe, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27-29</a>. the form employed is not "Nebuchadnezzar," but "Nebuchadnezzar" (so also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>). (See on Jeremiah 21:7.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a></div><div class="verse">And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servant</span> (see on Jeremiah 25:9). <span class="cmt_word">The Beasts of the field</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wild beasts. This last feature indicates the unlimited character of Nebuchadnezzar's power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a></div><div class="verse">And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him, and his son, and his son's son</span>. This is intelligible only if the seventy years predicted by Jeremiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12, 29</a>:10, are a round number. Nebuchadnezzar died in  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach, who, after two years, was put to death by Neriglissar. In  <span class="date">B.C. 555</span> Laberosoarchod (?) became king, but after nine months a usurper belonging to another family, Nabonedus or Nabunita, ascended the throne, which he occupied till  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, the year of the fall of Babylon. "Seventy years," taken literally, only brings us to  <span class="date">B.C. 555</span>, seventeen years short of the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Until the very time of his land come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">until the time of his own land</span> come. Nebuchadnezzar cannot ensure his realm against captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Shall serve themselves of him</span> (For the meaning of the phrase, see on Jeremiah 25:14.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your dreamers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your dreams</span>. So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a> the "dreams" of the people are expressly distinguished from the utterances of the prophets and soothsayers. In our passage the "dreamers" are appropriately mentioned between the "diviners" and the "enchanters," because the skill of the soothsayers partly lay in the interpretation of dreams (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-10.htm">Jeremiah 27:10</a></div><div class="verse">For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To remove you far</span>; or, more distinctly, <span class="accented">that I may remove you far</span>. So <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a>, "(Until) Jehovah have removed men afar off." The deportation policy of the Assyrians and Babylonians was overruled by God for his own deep purposes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a></div><div class="verse">But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The nations that bring their neck</span>, etc. The Hebrew has, "The nation that shall bring its neck," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a></div><div class="verse">I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - But the warnings of Jeremiah were not confined, far from it, to the neighboring kings. Zedekiah had received a precisely similar message. <span class="cmt_word">Bring your necks</span>. The plural is used, for Zedekiah was but an individual among a number of much more vigorous personalities (comp. on Jeremiah 22:2). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-13.htm">Jeremiah 27:13</a></div><div class="verse">Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-14.htm">Jeremiah 27:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</div><div class="comm">

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-16.htm">Jeremiah 27:16</a></div><div class="verse">Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - The warning to the priests and to the rest of the people. The last four verses of this section appear in a much shortened form in the Septuagint, and it must be admitted that the description is singularly lengthy. It is, therefore, quite conceivable that this is one of the cases in which the Hebrew text has been disfigured by willful interpolation. On the other hand, it is also possible that the description was filled out by an editor, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Baruch, conscientiously for the benefit of later readers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vessels of the Lord's house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the golden vessels which Solomon had made, and which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now shortly</span>. These words are wanting in the Septuagint, and, considering that the Greek is also without the prediction in ver. 22, that the vessels of the temple and of the palace should be brought back in the day of visitation (which seems inconsistent with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17</a>), the question arises whether the words "now shortly" here are not due to a hasty copyist. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a></div><div class="verse">Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?</div><div class="comm">

Seeing that a part of the sacred vessels had been carried to Babylon, ell true prophets ought to intercede with Jehovah that those still left might be spared. The end was that the remaining vessels were carried off on the capture of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>).

This shortened form throws a light on the fact of the absence of "now shortly" in ver. 16 (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The pillars</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two bronze pillars called Jachin and Boaz (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the molten "sea," or basin (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The bases</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
