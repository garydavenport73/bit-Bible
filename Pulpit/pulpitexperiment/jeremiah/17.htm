This is said to be <span class="cmt_word">graven upon the table of their heart</span>, for it is no mere form, but carried on with passionate earnestness, and as indelible as if engraved <span class="cmt_word">with an iron pen.</span> How unlike, however, is this record to that of which the same expression is used in <a href="../../par/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>! <span class="cmt_word">With the point of a diamond</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a point of adamant</span> (harder than flint, as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a> says). Fragments of adamant, says Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:15), are sought out by engravers and enclosed in iron; they easily overcome every hardness. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the horns of your altars.</span> First of all, what altars are referred to? Those erected for the worship of idols or the two in the temple of Jehovah, which had been defiled by idolatry? And why is the sin of Judah said to be engraved upon the horns of the altars? Probably because the "horns," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the projections at the four upper corners (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>) were smeared with the blood of the victims. The direction in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a> was doubtless not peculiar to the ritual of the Law.

Probably it is intended as an exemplification of the "sin of Judah," the inveterateness of which is shown by their thoughts spontaneously turning to the altars and symbols of the false gods whenever they are near a leafy tree or a high hill (probably "under the green trees" <span class="accented">is</span> the right reading; comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; so Targum). To make "their sons" the accusative (with Hitzig and Keil), rendering, "As they remember their children, [even so they remember their altars]," seems unnatural; why should "children" and "altars" be associated in idea? <span class="cmt_word">Groves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">idols of Asherah</span>, the Canaanitish goddess. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance <i>and</i> all thy treasures to the spoil, <i>and</i> thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my mountain in the field</span>; a still more obscure passage. The question is whether "my mountain in the field" is a vocative or an accusative dependent on "I will give." If the former, then the phrase will mean Jerusalem (comp. "rock of the plain," <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). This, however, does not suit with the second half of the verse ("thy high places," etch), and still less with ver. 4, which evidently refers to the people of Judah. Added to this, if Jerusalem were here addressed we should certainly expect feminine suffixes. It remains to take "my mountain," etc., as an accusative. It describes, not Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>). Render, therefore, my <span class="accented">mountain in the field will I give</span>. The prophet magnifies Zion into a mountain with a widely extended prospect (comp. ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance and all thy treasures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> these of the people. The part of the verse which begins here is almost the same as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a> (see note). <span class="cmt_word">And thy high places for sin</span>. Keil explains, Jehovah declares that he will, on account of the sinful practices upon them, deliver up the high places throughout the land. Gesenius, "He will deliver up the high places <span class="accented">with</span> the sin attaching to them;" Hitzig, "as a sin offering." There is a question, however, whether there is not a corruption in the text, and whether we should not read, with Ewald, "without price for thy sins" (as in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>).

The word involves an allusion to the Law in <a href="../../par/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a> and (especially) <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a> (see the Hebrew). The latter passage suggests a correction of the difficult "even with thyself," just preceding, into "thy hand." Thus we get for the opening of this verse, "And thou shalt let loose thy hand" (i.e. as Authorized Version, "shalt discontinue"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; Cursed <i>be</i> the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> - In the higher gnomic or proverbial style.

The prayer of the believer is, "Be thou (O Jehovah) their arm every morning;" not Egypt, not Assyria, not any "arm of flesh."

But which plant? St. Jerome explains, "Et erit quasi myrice ['tamarisk'], quae Hebraice dicitur Aroer (?) sire, at interpretatus est Syrus, lignum infructuosum." The versions agree in supposing the comparison to be to a plant; and a very similar word in Arabic (<span class="accented">ghargar</span>) means the mountain juniper; Tristram, the dwarf juniper. Most, however, take the word to be an adjective equivalent to "destitute." Dr. Thomson tells a story of a poor destitute woman he found in the desert (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a> - the form there is <span class="accented">Aroer</span>, here it is '<span class="accented">ar'ar</span>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not see</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall not perceive, or feel any evil consequences (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>, "I have seen the fire," equivalent to "feel the flame"). <span class="cmt_word">A salt land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one entirely barren (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>).

The Septuagint reads this verse differently, "The heart is deep above all things, and it is a man."

The prophet assumes the truth of a popular belief respecting the partridge (still a common bird in Judaea), that it brooded upon eggs which it had not laid. As the young birds soon leave the false mother, so unjustly acquired riches soon forsake their possessors. [Canon Tristram rejects this explanation, on the ground that the statement is not true to natural history; the partridge neither steals the broods of others nor needs to do so, as it lays a very large number of eggs. But grammar requires us to translate as suggested above, and consequently excludes any other explanation-May not the unusually large number of the eggs laid by the partridge have led to the fancy that they could not be all its own?] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">A glorious high throne from the beginning <i>is</i> the place of our sanctuary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - An address to Jehovah in two parts, the first specially referring to the temple regarded as the sacramental symbol of the Divine presence (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), the second to Jehovah himself. It seems to us, no doubt, singular thus practically to identify, Jehovah and his temple; but the prophet s meaning is that God can only be addressed in so far as he has revealed himself. The temple was not, strictly speaking, the "Name or revelation of God, but it was "the place of the Name of Jehovah," and in the language of strong feeling might be addressed as if it were really the Divine Name. The disciples of the incarnate Name were familiar with the idea that their Master was in some sense the antitype of the temple (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>). In proposing this explanation, it has been tacitly assumed that the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">A glorious high throne... is the place of our sanctuary</span>, is wrong. Grammatically, indeed, it is not indefensible; but it is a weak rendering in such a context. Render, therefore, Thou <span class="accented">throne of glory</span>, <span class="accented">a height from the beginning</span>, <span class="accented">thou place of our sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">thou hope of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>. The temple is called "the throne of thy glory" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>; "height" is a common synonym for heaven (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8, Hebrew</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, Hebrew), but is also applied to Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>, quoted by Keil), which is also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a> called, "the place of my sanctuary." By adding the concluding words of the address (at the opening of ver. 13), the prophet prevents the suspicion that he attached importance to the mere outward buildings of the temple, like those formalist Jews, whose words are quoted in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, <i>and</i> they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that depart from me</span>. The abrupt change of person is extremely harsh; the Vulgate, followed by Ewald and Olshausen, supposes that a final <span class="accented">caph</span> has dropped out, rendering, "they that depart from thee." <span class="cmt_word">Shall be written in the earth</span>; a contrast to that which is recorded for all time "with a pen of iron" (ver. 1). The fountain, etc.; a favorite phrase of our prophet (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).

He who makes his boast of Jehovah may reckon upon his help. This is Jeremiah's principle. He prays for healing, <span class="cmt_word">Heal me... and I shall be</span> - rather, <span class="accented">that I may be</span> - <span class="cmt_word">healed</span>. He is one of those "broken in heart," whom Jehovah alone can "heal" (<a href="../../par/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>).

Hence, as Keil remarks, the discourse of which this forms the conclusion must have been spoken before the first Babylonian invasion of Judah.

The prophet does not follow his own vague inclinations; he is but an under-shepherd, and waits on the will of his superior. He is, as Hosea calls him (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>, Hebrew), "the man of the Spirit." If God leads any one, whether people or individuals, it is through the agency of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11, 12</a>); and it is the characteristic of the typical prophet that his ear is "wakened morning by morning" to receive his daily lesson. Only by thus "following" the Divine Leader, can a prophet act as pastor to his people. [The construction is, however, rather simplified by the rendering - a perfectly legitimate one... <span class="accented">from following thee as a companion</span>.] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The woeful day</span>. The word for "woeful" is the same rendered "desperately wicked" (ver. 9); the "day" of Judah's calamity is metaphorically "sick," like the heart of man. <span class="accented">So</span>, other words being used, <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-11.htm">Isaiah 17:11</a> (end). <span class="cmt_word">Was right before thee</span>; rather (since some adjective must be supplied), <span class="accented">was manifest before thee</span>.

The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in <a href="../../par/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13.htm">Nehemiah 13</a>.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. "Sabbath" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate of the children of the people</span>. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the kings of Judah come in</span>. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase "kings of Judah" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-20.htm">Jeremiah 17:20</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Jeremiah addresses himself first of all to the <span class="cmt_word">kings of Judah</span>. As it would be very unnatural for a public orator to appeal to the yet unborn members of the reigning dynasty, and as there are several indications that the "house of David" was able at this period, as also in that of Isaiah, to exercise a decisive political and civil influence, even, as appears from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11, 12</a>, monopolizing the judicial functions, it is natural to suppose that "kings of Judah" is here used in a very special sense, via. of the members of the various branches of the royal family ("The sons of the <span class="accented">king</span>," <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>, "Jerahmeel, a king's son"), and their descendants, who received the royal title by courtesy (parallels for this will be found in Gesenius's 'Hebrew Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.<span class="accented">me'lek</span>). The queen-mother was probably the leader of this plan; "the mistress," as she was called (see on Jeremiah 13:18), and the royal princes (among whom the "house of Nathan," <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a>, would doubtless be reckoned), constituted in fact a body almost as numerous as they did (according to Brugsch Bey) in Egypt, and politically much more influential; so much so indeed that only a king of unusual force of character, like Hezekiah or Josiah, could venture, and that timidly, to oppose them. The weak-principled Zedekiah seems to have been entirely dominated by this powerful caste, and to have been little more than a <span class="accented">maire du palais</span> (the same sense of the phrase is required in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, and probably in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>).

The sacrifices are described with equal explicitness; they fall into two classes, the bloody (burnt offerings and other sacrifices) and the unbloody (the vegetable offering or <span class="accented">minkhah</span>, and the incense which was strewed upon the <span class="accented">min</span>-<span class="accented">khah</span>, <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bringing sacrifices of praise</span>.
