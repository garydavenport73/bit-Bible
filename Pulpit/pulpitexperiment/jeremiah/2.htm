It is an open question whether the "kindness" spoken of is that of God towards the people, or of the people towards God. The usage of the Hebrew (<span class="accented">khesed</span>) admits of either acceptation; comp. for the first, <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>, 36:5, and many other passages; for the second, <a href="../../par/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4, 6</a> (in ver. 6 rendering for "mercy," "goodness") and <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> (rendering "men of piety"). But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> ("as at the first"); <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-14</a>). The figure of the bride recurs constantly (see <a href="../../par/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thine espousals</span>; rather, thy <span class="accented">bridal</span> state. <span class="cmt_word">When thou wentest after</span> me (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, "all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness").

Isaiah, fond as he is of the phrase "Israel's Holy <span class="accented">One</span>," does not expressly enforce the correlative truth, as Jeremiah does here. <span class="cmt_word">The first-fruits of his increase</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his firstfruits</span> of increase. Israel is compared to the firstfruits (<span class="accented">reshith</span>) of the land, which were devoted to the house of the Lord (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12, 13</a>). So in <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>, the title given him is "the chief [margin, 'firstfruits'] of the nations" (in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>, a synonymous and cognate word, <span class="accented">rosh</span>, takes the place of <span class="accented">reshith</span> for "chief"). <span class="cmt_word">All that devour him shall offend</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that ate him incurred guilt</span>, or became guilty of a trespass. Foreigners were forbidden to eat of consecrated things; by breaking this law they became guilty of a "trespass," having invaded the rights of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10, 15, 16</a>). The word for "trespass" is the same as that rendered "guilt."

The remainder of the description, however, shows that "wilderness" is here meant, as often (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>), in the sense of "desert." Though recent travelers have shown that the Sinaitie peninsula is not by any means universally a "desert," and that in ancient times it was still less so, it is not unnatural that an agricultural people should regard it as a most inhospitable region, and should even idealize its terrors (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>). "Pits," i.e. rents and fissures in the soil, in which the unwary traveler might lose his life (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20, 22</a>).

"A Carmel land," as it were (so Payne Smith). "Carmel" is strictly an appellative noun, meaning" garden-land," i.e., land planted with vines and other choice plants.

First on the priests who "handle the <span class="accented">Law</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who have a traditional knowledge of the details of the Law, and teach the people accordingly (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; see also on Jeremiah 8:8); next on the "pastors," or "shepherds" (in the Homeric sense), the civil and not the spiritual authorities; so generally in the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5, 8, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); and lastly on the prophets, who sought their inspiration, not from Jehovah (comp. note on ver. 30), but from Baal. <span class="cmt_word">To prophesy by</span> (by means of) <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span> or rather, <span class="accented">the Baal</span>, implies that prophecy is due to an impulse from the supernatural world; that it is not an objectifying of the imaginations of the prophet himself. Even the Baal prophets yielded to an impulse from without, but how that impulse was produced the prophet does not tell us. We are told in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, that even prophets of Jehovah could be led astray by a "lying spirit;" much more presumably could prophets of the Baal. <span class="accented">The Baal is</span> here used as a representative of the idol-gods, in antithesis to Jehovah; sometimes "Baalim," or the Baals, is used instead (e.g. ver. 23; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a>), each town or city having its own Baal ("lord"). <span class="cmt_word">Things that do not profit</span>.

Who would prefer such an impure supply to the sweet, wholesome water of a fountain? But these cisterns cannot even be depended upon for this poor, turbid drink. They are "broken," like so many even of the best rock-hewn cisterns (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 287). How fine a description of the combined attractiveness and disappointingness of heathen religions, qualities the more striking in proportion to the scale on which the religions problem is realized (e.g. in Hinduism)! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> Israel a servant? <i>is</i> he a homeborn <i>slave</i>? why is he spoiled?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-19.</span> - Israel's <span class="accented">punishment and its cause</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is Israel a servant</span>? The speaker is evidently the prophet, who exclaims in surprise at the view which his prophetic insight opens to him: "quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur" (Calvin). For Israel is a member of Jehovah's family; he is not a servant (except in the same high sense as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-53</a>, where "servant" is virtually equivalent to "representative"), but rather in the highest degree a free man, for he is Jehovah's "firstborn son" (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). How is it, then, that he is dragged away into captivity like a slave who has never known freedom? The view of some, that "servant" means "servant of Jehovah" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>), and that the question therefore is to be answered in the affirmative, is less natural. "Servant," by itself, never has this turning; and there is a precisely similar term in the discourse at ver. 31, where the negative answer of the question does not admit of a doubt.

This is the climax of the calamity. Noph, called Moph in the Hebrew text of <a href="../../par/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, is generally identified with Memphis (after the Septuagint), which was called in the inscriptions Mennufr, or "the good abode," but may possibly be Napata, the Nap of the inscriptions, the residency of the Ethiopian dynasty (De Rouge'). <span class="cmt_word">Tahapanes</span>. The Hebrew form is <span class="accented">Takhpanes</span> or <span class="accented">Tahhpanhhes</span>.

From this verse onwards, Judah is personified as a woman, as appears from the suffixes in the Hebrew. Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). The abruptness with which ver. 16 follows upon ver. 15 suggests that some words have fallen out of the text.

But we may, if we prefer it, explain "by (or, rather, in) the <span class="accented">way</span>," on the analogy of the promise in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>, "I will lead them... in a straight way," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

The omission of the adjective in the present passage may be paralleled by <a href="../../par/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>, "Therefore will he instruct sinners in the (right) way."

The name given by Manasseh to his sen and successor (Amen) suggests that at one period in his reign an Egyptian policy was in the ascendant, which coincides with the tradition preserved in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>, of an Assyrian captivity of Manasseh. Jehoiakim at a later period was a vassal of Egypt (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To drink the waters</span>; taking up the idea of the second clause of ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">Sihor</span>, or Shihor, occurs again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>, as a name of the Nile. It properly means, not so much "the black" as "the dark grey" (connected with <span class="accented">shakhar</span>, the morning grey), from the color of the water. Rosenm&uuml;ller's contrast between the muddy waters of foreign streams and the "fountain of living waters" is uncalled for; besides, the Nile water has always been held in high esteem.

It is true that Assyria was, to say the least, powerless to interfere for good or for evil, when these words were written. But in ver. 5 the prophet has already warned us that his complaints are partly retrospective. It would seem that the Assyrian party from time to time gained the upper hand over the Egyptian in the councils of the State. Or perhaps the prophet may refer to the Quixotic fidelity to Assyria of Josiah (see below on ver. 36). <span class="cmt_word">The river</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Euphrates, "the great river" (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).

This is, grammatically, a possible rendering, but inconsistent with the second person in <span class="cmt_word">thou saidst</span>, unless indeed (with Ewald) we suppose that something has fallen out of the text between the first and the second clauses of the verse. The best critics, except Ewald and Dr. Payne Smith, are agreed that we should follow the Septuagint and Vulgate in rendering "thou hast broken... (and) burst." This does not, strictly speaking, imply a new reading of the text, for <span class="accented">ti</span> was the old form of the suffix of the 2nd pers. fem, sing.; there is a precisely similar case in <a href="../../par/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. It is a true description of the history of Israel before the exile. It would almost seem as if there was a fusion of two races among the Israelites, and that the smaller but nobler stock supplied all the great men in the sphere of religion; just as in Florence, most of the men who have illustrated her annals bear names of Teutonic origin. So we might argue, if we wished to explain the Biblical history from purely natural causes. But God (to apply the Caliph Omar's words) "knoweth his own." <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:5). <span class="cmt_word">I will not transgress.</span> This is the translation of the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible, which, though implied also in the Targum, is probably a conjecture of the Jewish critics. The text reading (also that of the Septuagint and the Syriac) is, "I will not serve," (equivalent to "I will not be a slave any longer"). Obviously this does not harmonize with the rendering "I have broken," etc., in the first clause (unless, with Dr. Payne Smith, we explain "I will not serve" as virtually equivalent to "I will still serve my idol-gods"); hence the Jewish critics, by just adding a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>), changed "serve" into "transgress." They did not venture to alter the next clause, which, quite as much as the first, presupposes the reading "serve" (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> - rather, <span class="accented">for</span> - <span class="cmt_word">upon every high hill</span>, etc. Bare, treeless heights were favorite spots for sacrifices, especially for Baal; groves, and leafy trees, in general, for the lascivious rites of Asherah and Ashtoreth. The apparently extreme statement of the prophet is not to be minimized. Travelers still tell us of vestiges of ancient and doubtless pro-Christian idolaters worship still visible on almost every attractive spot in the open country in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Under every green tree</span>. We have no single word to convey the "fluid" meaning of this expressive word.

Jeremiah means the choicest kind of Oriental vine, called <span class="accented">sorek</span> (from the dark-red color of its grapes), and mentioned again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>. The figure of the vine is one endeared to us by its association especially with our Lord; it was endeared to the Jews by the annual festivities of the vintage. The sacred writers are never afraid of its palling on the ear by repetition (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A right seed</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a vine-shoot of the genuine sort.

This is not a mere rhetorical fiction equivalent to "or if thou shouldst perhaps say," but probably represents an objection really made by the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah. Their fault was not in neglecting the public worship of Jehovah in his appointed temple, but in superadding to this, idolatrous rites inconsistent with the spiritual religion taught by Jeremiah. The people did not, it seems, regard this as tantamount to "following Baalim," just as some converts to Christianity in our own foreign missions might exclaim against being accused of apostasy, because they secretly carry on certain heathen practices. The prophet, however, applies a more rigorous test to their conduct. <span class="cmt_word">Baalim</span>; the plural of Baal, used for "other gods" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; comp. on ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Thy way in the valley</span>. <span class="accented">The valley</span> in this context can only be that of Hinnom (see on Jeremiah 7:31), which from the time of Ahaz had been defiled with the rites of "Moloch, horrid king" (see ' Paradise Lost,' 1:392-396). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a swift dromedary</span>. Ewald would attach this half of the verse to ver. 24; and there is something to be said for this plan. <span class="accented">Swift dromedary</span> is, properly speaking, in the vocative. The ardor of the people for idolatry is expressed by the comparison of it to the uncontrollable instinct of brute beasts. The word rendered "dromedary" is in the feminine gender; it means strictly the young she-camel which has not yet had a foal. <span class="cmt_word">Traversing her ways</span>; rather, <span class="accented">interlacing her ways</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. running backwards and forwards at the impulse of passion.

There is no hops; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the exhortation is in vain (so <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12</a>).

True, Manasseh's reactionary reign had intervened, but his counter-movement would not have been so successful had it not been attended by the good wishes of the people; and besides, the last years of Manasseh, according to the tradition in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-16</a> were devoted to undoing the mischief of his former life. The force of the prophet's words is strikingly brought out by M. Renan (he led an expedition to Phoenicia), who has shown that every district and every town had a cultus of its own, which often only differed from the neighboring cultus by words and titles (<span class="accented">nomina</span>, <span class="accented">numina</span>); comp.

The cities and towns of Judah are represented as so many mothers, and the populations as their children. It would, no doubt, be more natural to take "children" literally; but then we must read the verb in the next clause, "Ye have received," as the Septuagint actually renders. In the former case the "smiting" will refer to all God's "sore judgments" -sword, drought, famine, pestilence; in the latter, to the loss of life in battle. <span class="cmt_word">Your own sword hath devoured your prophets</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). Manasseh's persecution (which extended, according to Josephus, especially to the prophets) may  account for the preponderance of "false prophets" referred to in ver. 8 (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a></div><div class="verse">O generation, see ye the word of the LORD.

It is doubtful whether <span class="accented">generation</span> here means "contemporaries" (equivalent to "men of this generation"), or, like <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;</span> sometimes in the New Testament, a class of men united by moral affinity (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>). In the latter case we should rather attach the pronoun in "see ye" <span class="accented">to</span> "O generation," and render "O (evil) generation that ye are!" So Hitzig, Keil, and Payne Smith; Ewald and Delitzsch adopt the first rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Have I been a wilderness</span>, etc.? "Have I not been the source of light and happiness to my people, and of all temporal blessings?" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). So the Divine speaker in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain," or more literally, "in chaos" (same word as in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>); "chaos" and "the wilderness" are both images of that which is utterly unremunerative. <span class="cmt_word">A land of darkness</span>. This is, of course, not literally accurate as a description of the Arabian desert. "Darkness" is here used as a synonym for "misery." Cloud and rain occupy precisely opposite places in the estimation of nomadic and agricultural peoples respectively. "The Bedouins," says an Arabic scholast, "always follow the rain and the places where raindrops fall;" whereas a townsman of Mecca calls himself "child of the sun." So Indra and Varuna, originally belonging to the cloudy and rainy sky, are in the Vedic hymns endowed with solar traits. It should be added here that it is an old problem, and too difficult a one for us to investigate, whether we should render "the darkness of Jah" (Jehovah) or (as Authorized Version) simply "darkness." The former rendering will mean very great darkness, such as Jehovah sends in judgment (e.g. to the Egyptians, <a href="../../par/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). On this question, see Dr. Ginsburg on <a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a> (where a similar doubt exists), Geiger's 'Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel,' p. 276; Ewald, 'Lehrbuch der Hebraischen Sprache,' &sect; 270 e. <span class="cmt_word">We are lords</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we have broken loose</span>.

The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Blood of the souls</span> is explained by the statement in <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have "shed innocent blood very much" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the "solidarity" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. <span class="cmt_word">I have not found it by secret search</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast not found them breaking through</span> (<span class="accented">houses</span>). The phraseology agrees with that of <a href="../../par/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>, the law against "breaking through;" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily "dug into" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>, in the Greek). [Lieut.

Judah had so long been undisturbed by any foreign power, that the people fancied the promises of Deuteronomy were being fulfilled, and that they, on their part, had pleased God by their formal obedience (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-17.htm">2 Kings 22:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will plead with thee</span>. Here, as in some other passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>), the word includes the sense of punishing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a></div><div class="verse">Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why gaddest thou about so much</span> - many render, <span class="accented">Why runnest thou so quickly</span>; but the verb simply means to go, and it is enough to refer to foreign embassies, such as are alluded to in this very chapter (ver. 18) - <span class="cmt_word">to change thy way</span>? The "way" or policy of Judah was "changed," according as the party in power favored an Egyptian or an Assyrian alliance. <span class="cmt_word">Thou also shalt be ashamed of</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt also be brought to shame through</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>As thou art ashamed of Assyria</span> (correct rendering as before). This is certainly difficult, for in the reign of Josiah it would appear that the political connection with Assyria still continued, Is it possible that Jeremiah, in these words, has in view rather the circumstances of Jehoiakim than those of Josiah? Does he not appear to look back upon Judah's final "putting to shame through Assyria" as a thing of the past? And to what event can this expression refer but to the overthrow of Josiah at Megiddo (so Graf)?

Egypt was, in fact, the only great power capable of assisting Judah at this time (see Introduction); yet even Egypt, the prophet says, shall disappoint her Jewish allies, for Jehovah has rejected thy confidences (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the objects of thy confidence). As a matter of fact, "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his laud" after Necho's crushing defeat at Carehemish (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
