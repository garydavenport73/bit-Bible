The Hebrew has <span class="accented">leb-kamai</span>, which is <span class="accented">Kasdim</span>, or <span class="accented">Chaldea</span>, written in the cypher called Athbash (see on Jeremiah 25:26); just as <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> in ver. 41 is equivalent to Babel. The question arises whether the prophet himself is responsible for this covert way of writing, or a scribe in later times (so Ewald). In favour of the former view it may be urged that Babylon and Chaldea receive symbolic names (though not in Athbash) in the connected chapter (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21, 31, 32</a>); in favour of the latter, that the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 1, and does not express Sheshach in ver. 41, also that the clause to which Sheshach belongs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a> is of very dubious genuineness. <span class="cmt_word">A destroying wind;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the spirit</span> (<span class="accented">ruakh</span>) <span class="accented">of a</span> <span class="accented">destroyer</span> (or perhaps, of <span class="accented">destruction</span>). The verb rendered in this verse "raise up," when used in connection with <span class="accented">ruakh</span>, always means "to excite the spirit of any one" (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a></div><div class="verse">And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Farmers</span>. This is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, according to the Massoretic pointing, however, we should render "enemies." Possibly the prophet intended to suggest both meanings, <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">o</span> being so nearly related. <span class="cmt_word">Shall empty her land.</span> The original has a much mere striking word, shall pour out (for the figures, comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-12.htm">Jeremiah 48:12</a>), which occurs again in similar contexts in <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> (Hebrew, 2).

The difficulty, however, is in the first two words of the clause, which are the same in either reading. It would be much simpler to alter a single point, and render, "Let not the archer bend his bow; and let him not lift himself up in his coat of mail" (for the old word "brigandine," see on Jeremiah 46:4); which might be explained of the Babylonians, on the analogy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>, "Let him not bend his bow, for it will be useless;" but then the second half of the verse hardly suits the first - the prohibitions seem clearly intended to run on in a connected order. On the other hand, the descriptions, "him that bendeth," and "him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine," seem hardly a natural way of putting "the Chaldean army."

For Jehovah's purpose of vengeance cannot be reversed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath not been forsaken</span>. The Hebrew is much more forcible, "is not widowed" - alluding to the fundamental Old Testament idea of a mystic marriage between God and his people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4-6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Was filled with sin;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with guilt</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">asham</span>).

(Golden cups were not unknown in Palestine; Jehu sent some to Shalmaneser; Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' p. 114.) So, in Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the image, the head of the image is of gold (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32, 38</a>). But neither her splendour nor her honourable position as God's minister could save her from merited destruction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a></div><div class="verse">Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed</span>. The Hebrew, more forcibly, has "is broken." The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the "breach" of God's people is constantly referred to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howl for her</span>. Sympathetic bystanders are dramatically appealed to. From the next  verse it would seem that they are the various foreigners who, whether by choice or force, have been resident in Babylon, and who have acquired an interest in her fate. Hitzig thinks the foreign mercenaries (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>) or allies are specially referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Take balm for her pain</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>). The images of fracture and wound are combined, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a></div><div class="verse">We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up <i>even</i> to the skies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We would have healed Babylon.</span> Experience shows that it is useless to attempt to correct such inveterate evils. <span class="cmt_word">Everyone into his own country</span> (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her punishment. Perhaps there is an allusion to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, burned by fire from heaven. But we might also render "her crime" (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, where "worthy of death" is more strictly "a capital crime"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-10.htm">Jeremiah 51:10</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our righteousness;</span> literally, our <span class="accented">righteousnesses</span>; not in the sense of "righteous deeds "(as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>), but "those things which prove us to righteous; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by punishing Babylon he hath justified us" (Payne Smith).

"The reason, probably, is twofold: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the name <span class="accented">Madai</span> became known to the Jews at an earlier period than <span class="accented">Paras</span>, 'Persia;' and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Mazares and Harpagus, Herod., 1:157, 162)" (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:275, 276). The new Cyrus inscription throws light on the latter circumstance.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a></div><div class="verse">O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, <i>and</i> the measure of thy covetousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Babylon is addressed as <span class="cmt_word">thou that dwellest upon many waters,</span> with reference, not only to the Euphrates, but to the canals, dykes, and marshes which surrounded the city. <span class="cmt_word">The measure of thy covetousness.</span> A strange expression, even when we have supplied (and have we a right to do so?) a suitable verb, such as "is full." "Measure" is, literally, <span class="accented">ell</span>, "covetousness" should rather be <span class="accented">gain, or spoil</span>. Another possible rendering is, "The <span class="accented">ell</span> measure of thy cutting off." In fact, the root meaning of the word rendered "gain," or "covetousness," is "to cut off;" and the figure of cutting off a man's half-finished life, like a web from the loom, is familiar to us from the psalm of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>).

But the expression, "to fill a city with men," is more naturally taken of the increase of the population of the city; and it is better to render, with Ewald and Keil, "Even though [or, 'Surely even though'] I have filled thee with men, as with locusts, they shall raise over thee the cheer of the vintage;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the millions of Babylon's population will not save her from the most utter ruin.

But may not Jeremiah have quoted himself? Conceivably, yes; but he would surely not have quoted such a passage here, where it spoils the context. For granting that a point of contact with ver. 14 may be found for vers. 15, 16 (Jehovah who has sworn has also the power to accomplish), yet the passage on the idols stands quite by itself, and distracts the attention of the reader.

The mace (for a picture of which, see Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:459) was a weapon constantly employed by the Assyrians and presumably by the Babylonian kings. The battle axe was much less frequently used. But who is addressed by this terrible title? The commentators are divided, some inclining to Babylon, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because Babylon was the last person addressed (see ver. 14), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because a similar title was given to Babylon in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>: others to Israel, on the ground that the tenses are the same throughout the passage (vers. 20-24). The latter view is probably the best. How could Babylon be said to shatter her own "governors" and "viceroys" (for the prophet deliberately chooses the  Babylonian official names)? The argument from the context is not very weighty; for it is clear that the connection of the parts of this prophecy is very loose. We may assume, then, that ver. 20 begins a fresh paragraph, standing quite apart from that which precedes. The objection of Graf and Keil, is that Israel could not himself be styled a "mace," it being Israel's destiny to be delivered by others. But is not a very similar statement made of Israel in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7-9</a>?

Traces of that volcanic action are found in every direction. The black basaltic rock of the Hauran, the hot springs of Tiberius and Emmaus and Gadara, the naphtha fountains near the Dead Sea, the dykes of porphyry and other volcanic rooks that force their way through the limestone, the many eaves in the limestone rocks themselves, - all these show that we are treading on ground where the forces of the hidden fires of earth have been in times past in active operation.

Babylon, it should be remembered, was divided nearly in half by the Euphrates. It was guarded, says Professor Rawlinson, "by two walls of brick, which skirted them along their whole length. In each of these walls were twenty-five gates, corresponding to the number of the streets which gave upon the river; and outside each gate was a sloped landing place, by which you could descend to the water's edge, if you had occasion to cross the river. Boats were kept ready at these landing places to convey passengers from side to side; while for those who disliked this method of conveyance, a bridge was provided of a somewhat peculiar construction" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514). <span class="cmt_word">The reeds they have burned with fire.</span> This rendering is no doubt tenable, though it gives an unusual meaning to the first noun. The "reeds" would be those of the marshes in the neighbourhood of Babylon; and Kimchi suggests that these would be cut down to facilitate the entrance of the army into the city, Surely a very forced explanation. The natural meaning of the first noun is "pools" or "lakes," and, considering that Herodotus (1:185) speaks of a lake in connection with the defences of Babylon, it has been thought (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> by Vitringa) that the prophet may refer to something which was to happen to this and similar lakes; "burned with fire" is then regarded as a hyperbolical expression equivalent to "dried up" (comp. ver. 36). This, however, is hardly less forced than the first interpretation; and we seem almost compelled to assume s corruption of the text, and to read (for '<span class="accented">agammin</span>) '<span class="accented">armonim</span>, palaces. If "palaces" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> lofty houses, for such is the etymological meaning) were not uncommon at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), much more frequent must they have been at Babylon, Or perhaps the prophet refers to the two magnificent royal palaces, which, together with the temple of Bel, constituted the wonders of Babylon. They were on opposite sides of the river, and were guarded with triple enclosures, the circumference in the one case amounting to sixty stadia (nearly seven miles), and in the other to thirty (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514, etc.).

Ewald and others render thus: "Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen because of Babylon." But why this address to the slain ones of Israel? Besides, the antithesis indicated in the Hebrew is thereby destroyed. Hell explains the antithesis thus: "Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylonian slain ones of all the earth," viz. because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered. A better antithesis seems to be gained if we follow the Peshito, and read, at the end of the verse, "in the whole earth." It will then be asserted by the prophet that, just as Babylon was the cause of the slaying of Israelites, so (as a punishment) the Babylonian fugitives shall be slain wherever they may wander.
