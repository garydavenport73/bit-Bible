It was so on a former occasion (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), and it is so again, now that the Ammonites are occupying the land of the Gadites. True, the present generation has lost its property, but the next is the heir to all its rights and privileges. <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">their King</span> - their Melech or Moloch; it is the heavenly, not the earthly king who is referred to (so in <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, however, read <span class="accented">Milcom</span>, which was the name of the Ammonite deity; this is only a different vocalizing of the consonants of the text. The actual vowel points give "malcam." This reading may, of course, be interpreted of the <span class="accented">earthly</span> king of the Ammonites. But this view ignores the obvious parallelism of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh shall go forth into captivity." <span class="cmt_word">Inherit</span>. The primary meaning of the word is "to take possession of, especially by force, <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-6.htm">1 Kings 21:6</a>" (Gesenius, <span class="accented">ad voc</span>.), and this is the sense evidently required here (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>).

The form of the phrase reminds us of <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a></div><div class="verse">Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <i>and</i> his priests and his princes together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heshbon</span>. Here mentioned as <span class="accented">de jure</span> a Gadite, but <span class="accented">de facto</span> an Ammonitish, town; in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a> it appears as "the city of Sihon" the Amorite. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because <span class="cmt_word">Ai is spoiled</span>. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because <span class="accented">x</span> has been taken by storm; then the populations of the "daughter" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">resh.</span> Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar ("the city"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3, 14</a> it is described as "the city," and we have to be on our guard against the argument <span class="accented">a silentio</span> - that favourite weapon of destructive  criticism! Since a conjecture must be made, it is more respectful to the prophet to choose the one which is most suitable to the context. <span class="cmt_word">Daughters of Rabbah;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unwalled towns (as in ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">Run to and fro by the hedges;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by the enclosures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wander about in the open country, seeking a lodging place in the enclosures of the sheepfolds (so <a href="../../par/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>, Hebrew) or the vineyards (so <a href="../../par/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>, Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Their king</span>; or, <span class="accented">Milcom</span> (see on ver. 1).

The meaning of the phrase, however, is only probable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-5.htm">Jeremiah 49:5</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The Ammonitish community dissolved; every one earing for himself. <span class="cmt_word">Every man right forth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> straight before him, in a wild panic which expels every thought but that of self-preservation. <span class="cmt_word">Him that wandereth.</span> Collectively for "the wanderers," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fugitives.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a></div><div class="verse">Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <i>Is</i> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - A startling picture of the judgment impending over Edom, the severity of which is to be inferred from the behaviour of the sufferers. Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place <a href="../../par/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span> was celebrated for its "wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this "wisdom" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that "Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). One of Job's friends, Eliphaz, was a Temanite (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). From ver. 20, however, it appears that Teman is here used for Edom in general, of which it formed a part. "Wisdom" was doubtless cultivated throughout Idumaea (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>), the "land of Uz," in which Job dwelt, was probably in the east of Edom (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">Is their wisdom vanished?</span> The Hebrew, with its characteristic love for material symbols, has, "Is their wisdom poured out?" So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-7.htm">Jeremiah 19:7</a>, "I will pour out [a different word, however, is used] the counsel of Judah." The body being regarded as a vessel, it was natural to represent the principle of life, both physical (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and intellectual (as here), under the symbol of a liquid. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a></div><div class="verse">Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <i>that</i> I will visit him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn back.</span> The grammatical form is peculiar (literally, <span class="accented">be made to turn back</span>).

The Dedanites, it will be remembered, were a tribe devoted to commerce (see on Jeremiah 25:23). Isaiah had already, on an earlier occasion, given the same advice as Jeremiah, viz. to leave the beaten track and take refuge in a less exposed part of the desert, where shrubs and thorn bushes ("the forest," or rather, "the thickets") would secure them to some extent from observation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>). See, however, ver. 10.

The true God will provide for the widows and orphans, if Edom will but commit them to him. And let not Edom think it strange that he is punished; for even Israel, the chosen people, has drunk of the bitter cup. Yea, Jehovah has sworn "by himself" that all Edom's cities shall be laid waste. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Leave thy fatherless children,</span>  etc. The invitation means more than might be supposed. It is equivalent to a promise of the revival of the Edomitish people (comp. on Jeremiah 46:26; 48:47).

As yet Edom feels himself secure in his rocky home. But a Divine impulse already stirs the nation, through whom Jehovah wills to humble the proud. Edom shall become a second Sodom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have heard a rumour.</span> In Obadiah it is "<span class="accented">we</span> have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the company of prophets (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, "Who hath believed <span class="accented">our</span> report?" according to one interpretation). Jeremiah, to justify his adoption of the outward form of his prophecy, declares that he is personally responsible for its substance. "Rumour," or as the word is elsewhere rendered, "report," is a technical term for a prophetic revelation (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>); and it is from this Old Testament usage that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span> acquires its special meaning in <a href="../../par/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>. In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span>, or bearing, is a more exact equivalent of the original. A prophet is one who has "listened in the council of God" (<a href="../../par/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, corrected version; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), and "when the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" (<a href="../../par/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). Prophetic perception of Divine truth is so exceptional a thing that it can only be expressed approximately in terms of everyday life. One while it may be called a "hearing," a "report," another while a "vision" or "intuition." He who makes to hear or see is, of course, Jehovah, through the objective influence of his Spirit. It is important to study the Biblical phraseology, which has a depth of meaning too often overlooked, owing to the blunter edge which time has given to our modern speech. <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a herald.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Unto the heathen;</span> rather, unto <span class="accented">the nations.</span> There is no religious idea involved; the word <span class="accented">goyim</span> literally means "nations," and there is no reason for deviating from the primary sense. In the next verse it is even more necessary to make this correction.

The root-meaning is simply "continuance," whether it be continuance of strength (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. <span class="cmt_word">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span> Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference  from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this "obscure and much-vexed passage," as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a> we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either <span class="accented">read</span> (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), "For I will suddenly make them run away from it" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading "him" for "them," and explain "him" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for "suddenly" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, "in the twinkling of an eye." <span class="cmt_word">And who is a chosen man,</span> etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, "and will appoint over it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Edom] him who is chosen," viz. Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Who will appoint me the time?</span> The same phrase is rendered in <a href="../../par/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>, "Who shall set me a time to plead?" (comp. the Latin phrase <span class="accented">dicur dicere</span>). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, <span class="cmt_word">Who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp.

(The third of the Aramaean kingdoms, that of Zobah, had ceased to exist.) Damascus had already been threatened by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-5</a>), and by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>). We may infer from the prophecy that Damascus had provoked the hostility of Nebuchadnezzar, but we have as yet no monumental evidence as to the facts. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. Still an important city under the name of Hamah, situated to the north of Hums (Emesa), on the Orontes. It formed nominally the boundary of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), was actually a part of the empire of Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), and was conquered for a short time by Jeroboam II. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Under Sargon it was fully incorporated into the Assyrian empire (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>); rebellious populations were repeatedly transplanted into the territory of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span>. Always mentioned together with Hamath, whose fate it appears to have shared (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). A tell, or hill, with ruins, about three (German) miles from Aleppo, still bears the name Erfad (<span class="accented">Zeitschrift</span> of the German Oriental Society, 25:655). There is <span class="cmt_word">sorrow on the sea</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even the sea participates in the agitation of that troublous time: somewhat as in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> the sea is represented as sympathizing in the terror produced by a Divine manifestation. But by the slightest possible emendation (viz. of <span class="accented">caph</span> into <span class="accented">beth</span>) we obtain a more natural sense - "with an unrest <span class="accented">as of</span> the sea, which cannot be quiet." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> we read, "For the ungodly are like the troubled sea, for it cannot be quiet;" and it can hardly be doubted that Jeremiah is alluding to this passage. If he altered it at all, it would be in the direction of greater smoothness rather than the reverse. Not a few manuscripts of Jeremiah actually have this corrected reading, which should probably be adopted.

"How is not," etc. I can only mean "How is it that the city of praise is not," etc.?(comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>). The difficulty lies in the word rendered "left."

This, however, does  not suit the context, which shows that "the daughter of Damascus" personified is the speaker, so that ver. 25 ought rather to mean, "How is it that the city of praise <span class="accented">is</span> [not, '<span class="accented">is not'</span>] forsaken?" Either, then, we must suppose that "not" has been inserted by mistake - a too arbitrary step, seeing that there is no negative in the context to account for the insertion (the case is different, therefore, from <a href="../../par/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>, where such an insertion is at any rate justifiable); or else we must give <span class="accented">uzzebhah</span> the sense of "let go free" (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>).

The title places this prophecy later than these in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1-49:33</a>; viz. at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. From this filet, and from the absence of any reference to Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument of Elam's humiliation, Ewald conjectures that the Elamites had been concerned in the events which led to the dethronement and captivity of Jehoiachin. Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to accept this hypothesis, remarking that the Elamites "appear perpetually as the allies of Merodach-baladan and his sons in their struggles for independence." We are not yet, however, in  possession of information as to the relations of Elam to the great Babylonian empire which rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian. Ewald's conjecture is a possibility, and no more. And what was Elam? One of the most ancient kingdoms in the world (see <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.). Geographically it was the tract of country., partly mountainous, partly lowland, lying south of Assyria and east of Persia proper, to which Herodotus gives the name of Cissia, and the classical geographers that of Tusis or Tusiaua. This is clear, says Sehrader, from the Persian text of the Behistun inscription of Darius. It is fro-quently mentioned under the name "Ilam," or "Ilamti," in the Assyrian inscriptions, especially in those of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assurbauipal. In B.C 721 Sargon states that he annexed a district or province of Elam (and hence, perhaps, we must explain the mention of the Elamites in the Assyrian army in <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), which was, doubtless, one cause of the embittered feeling towards Assyria of the portion which remained independent. The annals of the heroic struggle of Merodach-baladan contain repeated reference to the King of Elam. Assurbanipal made no less than three invasions of Elam, and the singular pretext for the third is, curiously enough, associated with the remarkable fourteenth chapter of Genesis. It was this - that the Elamite king had refused to deliver up an image of the goddess Nana, which Kudur-nankhundi, an ancient Elamite monarch, had carried oft, and which had remained 1635 or (perhaps) 1535 years in Elam. This king has been plausibly conjectured to be a member of the same dynasty as "Chedorlaomer [  =   Kudur-Lagamar] King of Elam." This time it was all over with Elam; Shushan itself was plundered and destroyed, and far and wide the country was laid waste. That so restless and courageous a people should have become famous among the surrounding nations was only to be expected; and it is a striking proof of this that Ezekiel, in describing the companions whom fallen Egypt would meet with in Hades, mentions "Elam and all her multitude" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>). The fact that the Septuagint has the heading twice over - first very briefly (in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>, where it is followed by this prophecy), and then at full length (in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>, at the end of the prophecy of Elam) - has been variously explained. It is, at any rate, clear that there is some confusion in the present text of this translation. In connection with this prediction it is interesting to notice one of the results of a new cuneiform discovery among some tablets acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. At the very time when Nebuchadnezzar was taking an oath of allegiance from Zedekiah, he was also engaged in hostilities against Elam. "We do not know," says Mr. Pinches, "what brought the Babylonians into hostilities with the Elamites, but the result of the expedition was to bring the whole kingdom of Elam within the boundaries of the Babylonian monarchy" (<span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 7:214).

Into the fulfilment of this promise we need not inquire in too prosaic a spirit. It is true that "Elamites" are mentioned among the persons present on the great "day of Pentecost" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>). But this would be a meagre fulfilment indeed. The fact is that, both in the narrative in the Acts and in this prophecy, the Elamites are chiefly mentioned as representatives of the distant and less civilized Gentile nations, and the fulfilment is granted whenever a similar people to the Elamites is brought to the knowledge of the true religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/48.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 48"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 48" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/50.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 50"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 50" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
