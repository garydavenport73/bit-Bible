Here we must understand the same verb which is expressed in the psalm, "They bowed down in mourning attire to the ground." "Black," however, is not to be taken literally; it means rather "squalid, unwashed" (of garments).

The allusion is to the way jackals hold their head as they howl.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man <i>that</i> turneth aside to tarry for a night?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - How pathetic a supplication! Jehovah will surely not be <span class="cmt_word">as a</span> <span class="cmt_word">stranger in the land</span> - the strangers, or" sojourners," like the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, enjoyed no civic rights, and consequently had no interest in the highest concerns of the state, <span class="cmt_word">and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside</span> - or perhaps, <span class="accented">pitcketh his tent</span>; for the traveler in Palestine doubtless carried his tent with him then as now - <span class="cmt_word">to tarry for a night</span>. With the latter figure compare the beautiful comparison of the hope of the ungodly to "the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day" (Wisd. 5:14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man <i>that</i> cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a man astonished</span>; rather (comparing the Arabic <span class="accented">dahama</span>), <span class="accented">as one struck</span> dumb. But Dr. Payne Smith, with much reason, is more than half inclined to follow the Septuagint reading, equivalent to "as one in a deep sleep." <span class="cmt_word">Leave us not</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lay us not down</span>; as if a burden of which the bearer is tired. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16.</span> - The answer of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus have they loved to wander, ... therefore the Lord doth not accept them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with such pertinacity have they been set upon "wandering" (roving lawlessly about), that the Lord hath no more pleasure in them. "Therefore," is, literally, <span class="accented">and</span>. "Thus," or "so," is used in the same sense as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, which runs literally, "... there came not so [abundantly] among timber." The particle of comparison has given much occupation to the commentators (see Payne Smith's note), but the above view is at once simple and suitable to the context; for Jeremiah has already admitted that "our backslidings are multiplied" (Ver. 7). <span class="accented">The Lord doth not</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. (to the end of the verse), is quoted <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from <a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>. Jeremiah puts conspicuous honor on the older inspired writers; he has no craving for originality. Nearly all has been said already; what he has to do is chiefly to adapt and to apply, <span class="cmt_word">He will now remember</span>, etc. The emphasis is on "now" Nothing is more remarkable in the prophets than the stress laid on the unerring justness of the time chosen for Divine interpositions. When the iniquity is fully ripe, it as it were attracts the punishment, which till then is laid up in store (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-11.htm">Jeremiah 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for <i>their</i> good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pray not for this people</span>. So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a> (on which see note); <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their cry</span>. The word is very forcible; it is the shriek in which an unsophisticated man gives vent to his pain and grief. <span class="cmt_word">An oblation</span>. It is the vegetable offering (Authorized Version, "meat offering;" Luther, "speisopfer") which is referred to in the so-called <span class="accented">minkhah</span> (literally, <span class="accented">gift</span>). Though sometimes offered separately, it regularly accompanied a burnt offering. <span class="cmt_word">I will not accept them</span>. Dr. Payne Smith tries to soften the rejection of these worshippers by the remark that "there is a time when the most genuine repentance avails nothing to avert the temporal consequences of sin." But the analogy of other similar passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>) warrants the view of Keil that the ground of the rejection of the worship is its heartless formalism and insincerity, which was equally a bar to Jehovah's favor and the prophet's intercession. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - "Pleading with Providence, the good prophet lays the blame on ill teaching, but the stern answer (Ver. 14), admitting the plea as true, rejects it as inadequate (Ver. 14), and denounces sorrows which (Vers. 17-22) the prophet passionately deprecates" (Rowland Williams). <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God!</span> rather, <span class="accented">Alas! O Lord Jehovah</span> (see on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">The prophets say unto them</span>. The greater part of the prophetic order had not kept pace with its more spiritual members (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). They still traded on those natural gifts of divination (<a href="../../par/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>) which were, no doubt, where genuine, of Divine origin, but which, even then, needed to be supplemented and controlled by a special impulse from the Spirit of holiness. Jeremiah, however, declares, on the authority of a revelation, that these prophets did not divine by any God-given faculty, but "the deceit of their own heart" (Ver. 14). The Deuteronomic <span class="accented">Torah</span>, discovered after a period of concealment at the outset of Jeremiah's ministry, energetically forbids the practice of the art of divination (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A thing of naught</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-21.</span> - The prophet's grief, and second intercession. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou shalt say,</span> etc. There is something strange and contrary to verisimilitude in the prefixing of this formula, not to a Divine revelation, but to a mere expression of the pained human feelings of the prophet. It is possible that the editor of Jeremiah's prophecies thought the paragraph which begins here needed something to link it with the preceding passage, and selected his formula rather unsuitably. <span class="cmt_word">Let mine eyes run down</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>). Jeremiah's tender compassion shows itself in his choice of the expression, <span class="cmt_word">the virgin daughter of my people</span>, just as we feel an added bitterness in the premature death of a cherished maiden. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a></div><div class="verse">If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - A picture of the state of things after the capture of Jerusalem: the slain without, the famine-stricken within. The latter are described allusively as "sicknesses of famine" (so literally). As a peculiarly striking evidence of the downfall of greatness, it is added that even prophet and priest have to <span class="cmt_word">go about into a land that they know not</span>. The verb used here can obviously not have its ordinary sense of going about for purposes of traffic. Aramaic usage suggests, however, a suitable meaning; what the prophet sketches before us is a company of these ex-grandees "begging their way" into an unknown land.
