As the writer of Chronicles says (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>), "He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, <span class="accented">and made also molten images for Baalim</span>." <span class="accented">Baalim</span> is either a plural of dignity, or a word denoting the different forms under which Baal was worshipped, as Melkarth, Adonis, Rimmon, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and made his son to pass through the fire.</span> In Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>) we are told that "he burnt incense in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire," as if he had sacrificed more than one son. The practice of offering children in sacrifice was not a feature of the Assyro-Babylonian religion, as some suppose, but an intrinsic part of the worship of the Phoenicians, common to them with the Moabites, Ammonites, and others. It was based upon the principle of a man's offering to God that which was dearest and most precious to himself, whence the crowning sacrifice of the kind was a man's offering of his firstborn son (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). Some have supposed that the rite was a mere dedication or lustration, the children passing between two fires, and being thenceforward employed only in God's service. But the expressions used by the sacred writer and others, and still more the descriptions that have come down to us from heathen and patristic authors, make it absolutely certain that the "passing through the fire' was no such innocent ceremony as this, but involved the death of the children. The author of Chronicles says, "Ahaz <span class="accented">burnt</span> his children in the fire;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>, "They have built also the high places of Baal, <span class="accented">to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings</span> unto Baal;" <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>, "Thou hast <span class="accented">slain</span> my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire." Josephus declares of Ahaz that he "made his own son a whole burnt offering (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Diodorus Sicalus describes the ceremony as it took place at Carthage, the Phoenician colony. There was in the great temple there, he says, an image of Saturn (Moloch), which was a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms. This image of metal was made glowing hot by a fire kindled within it; and the children, laid in its arms, rolled from thence into the fiery lap below. If the children cried, the parents stopped their noise by fondling and kissing them; for the victim ought not to weep, and the sound of complaint was drowned in the din of flutes and kettle-drums (Died. Sic., 20:14). "Mothers," says Plutarch ('De Superstitione,' &sect; 13), "stood by without tears or sobs; if they wept or sobbed, they lost the honor of the act, and the children were sacrificed notwithstanding." The only doubtful point is whether the children were placed alive in the glowing arms of the image, or whether they were first killed and afterwards burnt in sacrifice; but the description of Diodorus seems to imply the more cruel of the two proceedings. <span class="cmt_word">According to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel.</span> (On the practice of this terrible rite by the Canaanitish nations at the time of the Israelite invasion, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37, 38</a>.)

It began, apparently, in the reign of Jotham. The policy which brought it about was one that was entirely new. Since Syria developed an aggressive tendency under the first Ben-hadad (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), there had till now been no alliance made with her by either of the two Israelite kingdoms. She had been reckoned as their common enemy; and while they had on two occasions been allied together against her (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>), never as yet had either asked her help against the other. Now, however, Ephraim became confederate with Syria against Judah. The new policy must be ascribed to the new condition of things consequent upon the attitude assumed by Assyria under Tiglath-pileser. Assyria had been under a cloud for forty years. The nations of the western coast of Asia had ceased to fear her, and had felt at liberty to pursue their own quarrels. Her recovery of vigor altered the whole situation. It was at once evident to the statesmen who directed the policy of the small western states that, unless they combined; they were lost. Hence the alliance between Pekah and Rezin. Probably they would have been glad to have drawn Ahaz into the confederacy; but it would seem that he did not share their fears, and would not join them. Hereupon the design was formed to dethrone him, and set up in his place a new ruler, a certain Ben-Tabeal (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), on whose assistance they could rely. The two confederate princes then began the campaign. Pekah invaded Judaea, and gained a great victory over Ahaz, which is perhaps exaggerated in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-15</a>; Rezin carried his arms further south, took Elath, and reestablished the Edomites in power (see the comment on ver. 6). Then the allies joined forces and proceeded to besiege Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And they besieged Ahaz,</span> but could not ever-come him. The siege is mentioned by <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>, who was commissioned by God to comfort Ahaz, and assure him that the city would not fall (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-7.htm">Isaiah 7:7</a>). The fortifications of Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>) and Jotham (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) had, no doubt, greatly strengthened the city since the time when (as related in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>) it was captured so easily by Joash. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Rezin, King of Syria recovered Elath to Syria.</span> The Syrians had certainly never previously been masters of Elath, which had always hitherto been either Jewish or Edomite (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>).

In the extremity of his danger, when the confederacy had declared itself, or perhaps later, when he had suffered terrible defeats, and was about. to be besieged in his capital (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5, 6</a>), Ahaz invoked the aid of Tiglath-pileser, sent him all the treasure on which he could lay his hands (ver. 8), offered to place himself and his kingdom under the Assyrian monarch's suzerainty, and entreated him to come and "save him out of the hands" of his enemies (ver. 7). Humanly speaking, he might be justified. He had not called in one foreign power until Pekah had called in another. There was no other prospect (again humanly speaking) of escape. But, had he accepted the offers of <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>, and relied wholly on Jehovah, his position would have been far better. However, he was unable to see this; he made his application; and Tiglath-pileser "came up," and utterly crushed the Syro-Israelite confederacy  (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, saying.</span> This appeal to man rather than to God, this trust in "an arm of flesh," was exactly what Isaiah had been endeavoring to prevent, what he viewed as unfaithfulness, and as inevitably drawing down God's wrath both upon king and kingdom. Ahaz was young, was weak, and had no doubt a large body of advisers, who considered the prophet to be a fanatic, who had no belief in supernatural aid, and who thought that in any emergency recourse was to be had to the measures which human prudence and human policy dictated. The aid of Tiglath-pileser seemed to them, under the circumstances, the only thing that could save them; and they persuaded the weak prince to adopt their views. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant and thy son.</span> The offer of submission was unmistakable. "Servant," in the language of the time, meant "slave." Complete subjection, enrollment among Assyria's feudatories, the entire loss of independence, was well understood to be the price that had to be paid for Assyria's protection. Ahaz and his worldly advisers were prepared to pay it. They surrendered themselves, body and soul, into the hands of the great world-power of the period. <span class="cmt_word">Come up, and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the hand of the King of Israel, which rise up against me.</span> Syria is put forward as at once the more formidable of the two foes, and the one most open to Assyrian attack. Already Damascus had been more than once menaced by Assyrian armies ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 113, 115, 116), while the kingdom of Samaria had only suffered at her extremities (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). Samaria could not well be approached excepting through Syria, and after Syria's downfall.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried <i>the people of</i> it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria hearkened unto him.</span> Overtures of the kind were almost certain to be accepted. The great conquering monarchs of the East were always glad to receive small states into their alliance for a time, and even to allow them a shadow of independence, while they made use of their services against their near neighbors. Tiglath-pileser was already bent on conquering Samaria and Damascus, and could not fail to perceive that their subjugation would be greatly facilitated by his having the support of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For the King of Assyria</span>  - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - went</span> up against Damascus. Damascus was naturally attacked first, as nearer to Assyria than Samaria, and also as more wealthy and more important. Tiglath-pileser's records contain an account of the campaign, but it is unfortunately much mutilated. We may gather from it, however, that Resin began by meeting his assailant in the field, and engaging him in a battle which was stoutly contested. Eventually the Assyrians were victorious, and Resin, having fled hastily to Damascus, shut himself up within its walls. Tiglath-pileser pursued him, laid siege to the city, and eventually took it, though not perhaps till it had resisted for above a year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 65). The Assyrian monarch thus describes the siege (ibid., p. 121): "Damascus, his city, I besieged, and like a caged bird I enclosed him. His forests, the trees of which were without number, I cut down; I did not leave a tree standing. [I burnt] Hadara, the house of the father of Rezin, King of Syria." <span class="cmt_word">And took it.</span> The ancient Damascene kingdom, which had lasted from the time of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), was thus brought to an end. Damascus gave the Assyrians no further trouble; and within little more than thirty years it had been so absolutely absorbed into the empire that its governor was one of the Assyrian eponyms ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). The capture of the city, foretold by <a href="../../par/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4, 5</a>, was followed by the destruction of its walls and palaces. <span class="cmt_word">And carried the people of it captive.</span> The system of transplanting large masses of the population from one part of the empire to another seems to have begun with Tiglath-pileser. In his very imperfect and fragmentary annals we find the removal of above thirty thousand captives recorded, of whom more than half are women. His example was followed by his successors on a still larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">To Kir</span>. The situation of "Kir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) is wholly uncertain. It has been identified with Kis (Elam or Kissia); with the country watered by the Kur; with Kourena or Koura, on the river Mardus; with Karine, the modern Kirrind; with Kirkhi near Diartekr; and with Kiransi in the Urumiyeh country. But the similarity of sound is the sole basis for each and all of these identifications. It is best to confess our ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And slew Rezin.</span> This is perhaps implied, but it is not distinctly stated, in the extant annals of Tiglath-pileser. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that <i>was</i> at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-18.</span> - <span class="accented">Religious changes introduced into Judea by Ahaz</span>. The new position into which Ahaz had brought himself with respect to Assyria was followed by certain religious changes, which were probably, in part at any rate, its consequence, though some of them may have been the result of his own religious (or irreligious) convictions. He had a new altar made and introduced into the temple, which at first he used for his own private sacrifices (vers. 10-13); then, that his new altar might occupy the pest of honor, he removed from its place the old brazen altar of Solomon, and put it in an inferior position (ver. 14). After this, he required all sacrifices to be offered on the new altar (ver. 15). Finally, he proceeded to interfere with several other of Solomon's arrangements, with what particular object is not very apparent (vers. 17, 18). In carrying out all these changes, he had the high priest of the time for his obsequious servant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria.</span> It was a practice of the Assyrian monarchs to hold <span class="accented">durbar's</span>, or courts, at central places in the provinces, in the course of their military expeditions, whereat to receive the subject princes of the neighborhood, who were expected to do homage, and bring with them presents, or their fixed tribute. Tiglath-pileser held one such court in the earlier part of his reign at Arpad, a Syrian town, at which were present the kings of Comma-gene, Syria, Tyre, Carchemish, Gaugama, and others. He seems to have held another at some unknown place, about  <span class="date">B.C. 732</span> (it may have been at Damascus), which was attended by the kings of Commagene, Car-chemish, Gebal, Hamath, Gaugama, Tubal, Arvad, Ammon, Moab, Askelon, Gaza, Edom, and Judah, the last-mentioned being Yahu-khazi (Jehoahaz), by which is probably meant Ahaz. It is with reason conjectured that this was the occasion mentioned in the text, when "King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser." <span class="cmt_word">And saw an altar that was at Damascus.</span> It is almost certain that this was an Assyrian altar.

When Ahaz visited Tiglath-pileser at Damascus, and "saw an altar," it was, in all probability, Tiglath-pileser's altar. The Assyrian kings were accustomed to carry altars about with them, and to have them set up in their fortified camps, or in other convenient places. They also, not infrequently, set up altars to the great gods in the countries which they conquered, and required the inhabitants to pay them reverence. Ahaz may either have been required by Tiglath-pileser to set up an Assyrian altar in the temple, or he may have volunteered the act as one which was likely to please his suzerain. <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the high priest <span class="cmt_word">- the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it.</span> Assyrian altars were quite different from Jewish ones. Generally they were of small size, either square with a battlemented edge, or round at the top and supported on a triangular base ('Dict. of the Bible,' <span class="accented">ad voc</span>. "Altar," vol. 1. p. 55, woodcuts Nos. 3 and 5). It is scarcely likely that Ahaz was particularly pleased with the pattern (Keil), and therefore wished to have one like it. He probably merely wished to satisfy his suzerain that he had conformed to some of his religious usages. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the workmanship thereof.</span> Though not very elaborate, the Assyrian altars have an ornamentation which is peculiar and unmistakable. Careful instructions would be needed for workmen who had never seen the sort of object which they were required to produce.

But Urijah was a man of a weaker fiber, and does not seem to have thought even of remonstrance, much less of resistance.

What the writer has it in his mind to record is that the king, on his return from Damascus, at once made use of the new' altar for his private sacrifices. If he had meant to tax Ahaz with so great a sin as that which brought the curse of leprosy upon Uzziah, he would almost certainly have made his meaning clearer.

Having introduced his self-invented <span class="accented">quasi-idolatrous</span> altar into the temple, and so inserted "the thin end of the wedge," Ahaz was not satisfied, but proceeded to another innovation. Urijah, having had no express order from the king with respect to the position of the new altar, had placed it in front of the old one, between it and the eastern gate of the court. Thus the old altar, which was directly in front of the temple porch, seemed to cut the new altar off from the temple. Ahaz would not have this continue, and resolved on removing the altar of Solomon from, its place, and putting it elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">From the forefront of the house</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>), <span class="cmt_word">from between the altar</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new altar - <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the temple building - <span class="cmt_word">and put it on the north side of the altar.</span> The removal of Solomon's altar from its place of honor to a side position left the space clear between the temple and the new altar, which thus, without exactly occupying the same site, took practically the place of Solomon's altar. Solomon's altar, shifted to one side, was put, as it were, in the background; the eye rested on the new altar, right in front of the porch and temple, which so became "the main altar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>), as it is called in the next verse.
