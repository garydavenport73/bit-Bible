It is curious that all three were the sons of wicked fathers. Hezekiah was probably, at an early age, Brought under the influence of Isaiah, who was on familiar terms with his father Ahaz (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3-16</a>), and would be likely to do all that lay in his power to turn Hezekiah from his father's evil ways, and to foster all the germs of good in his character.

He began, as we learn from Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3, 17</a>), "in the first year of his reign, the first month, and the first day," by reopening the temple, which Ahaz had shut up, removing from it all the "filthiness" which Ahaz had allowed to accumulate (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>), gathering together the priests and Levites and exhorting them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4-11</a>), restoring and renewing the vessels which Ahaz had cut in pieces (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-19.htm">2 Chronicles 29:19</a>), and then re-establishing the temple-worship with all due solemnity (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20-35</a>). He next resolved on holding a grand Passover-festival, in the second month, as it had not been possible to keep it in the first (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2, 3</a>), and invited thereto, not only his own subjects, but the Israelites of the neighboring kingdom who were not yet carried off, but were still under the rule of Hoshea (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10, 11, 18</a>). It was not until this festival was over that the removal of the high places was taken in hand. Then, in a fit of zeal, which no doubt the king encouraged, a multitude of those who had kept the feast went forth from Jerusalem, first into the cities of Judah and Benjamin, and then into several of the cities of Israel, and "brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars... and utterly destroyed them all" (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And brake the images, and cut down the groves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the grove</span>, according to the present text; but, as all the versions have the plural, Thenius thinks <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> should be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, would retain the singular, but understand it "collectively." That idolatry was practiced at some of the high places seems clear from this place, as well as from <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). Difficulties are raised with respect to this statement. Some argue that the serpent, having served its purpose, would have been left hanging at the place where it was set up in the wilderness; others, that Moses would have destroyed it, lest the Israelites should make it an idol; others, again, that it was not likely to have lasted seven hundred years from the Exodus, even if it was brought into Palestine and taken care cf. It is supposed, therefore, that an imitation of the original serpent had been made by the Jews in the reign of Ahaz, had been called "the serpent Of Moses," and was now destroyed. But there is no sufficient reason for any of these suppositions. Considering what the serpent typified (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), it is not surprising that Moses should have been instructed to preserve it with the furniture of the tabernacle, or that, when once attached to that structure, it should have been preserved as a religious relic for seven hundred years. Many Egyptian figures in bronze now exist which are from three thousand to four thousand years old. The statement of the writer of Kings, that Hezekiah did now destroy "the serpent <span class="accented">that Moses had made</span>," is of more weight than a thousand speculations concerning what is likely, or not likely, to have happened. <span class="cmt_word">For unto these days the children of Israel did burn incense to it.</span> Not, certainly, "from Moses' time to Hezekiah's," but from a date left vague and undetermined to the time when Hezekiah took his religious reformation in hand. Hezekiah found the practice continuing; the writer is not concerned to say - perhaps does net know - when it began. He implies, however, that it was of long standing. Serpent-worship was widely spread in the East, and there was more excuse for directing religious regard toward this serpent than toward any other. <span class="cmt_word">And he called it Nehushtan</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was called Nehushtan</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> is a singular with indefinite subject ("one called"), equivalent to "they called," or "it was called" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29, 30</a>). Nehushtan is not from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> "serpent," but from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5ea;</span>, "brass," and means "the little brass thing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5df;</span> being a diminutive, expression of tenderness.

This was exactly what God required as the condition on which he would give his aid (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), and what no previous king since the Assyrian troubles began could bring himself to do. <span class="cmt_word">So that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</span> It has been concluded from this statement that, "when the merits of the kings were summed up after the fall of the monarchy, Hezekiah was, by a deliberate judgment, put at the very top" (Stanley 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397); but, as exactly the same words are used of Josiah in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25</a>, the true conclusion would seem to be rather that Hezekiah and Josiah were selected from the rest, and placed upon a par, above all the others. At first sight there may seem to be contradiction between the two passages, since absolute pre-eminence over <span class="accented">all</span> the other kings is ascribed to Hezekiah in one of them, to Josiah in the other; but the context shows that the pre-eminence is not the same in the two cases. To Hezekiah is ascribed pre-eminence in <span class="accented">trust</span>; to Josiah, pre-eminence in an exact observance of the Law: one excels in faith, the other in works; Josiah's whole life is one of activity, Hezekiah's great merit lies in his being content, in the crisis of his fate, to "stand still, and see the salvation of God."

And he prospered whithersoever he went forth; rather, <span class="accented">in all his goings - in cunctis ad quae procedebat</span> (Vulgate). Hezekiah's prosperity is enlarged upon by the writer of Chronicles, who says (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-30</a>), "And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, add for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.... And Hezekiah prospered in all his works." Many brought presents to him to Jerusalem, and he was magnified in the sight of all the surrounding nations (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not.</span> Hezekiah's "rebellion" probably took place at the very commencement of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, in the year that Shalmaneser ascended the throne. Most likely it consisted simply in his withholding his tribute, and neither going in person nor sending representatives to Nineveh, to congratulate the new monarch on his accession. This would be understood as an assertion of independence. That it was not at once resented must be ascribed to Shalmaneser's difficulties with Samaria and with Tyre, which were more pressing, as they lay nearer to Assyria. Before these were over, Sargon usurped the crown. There is reason to believe that he made at least one expedition against Hezekiah; but the date of it is uncertain. Rebellion met him on all sides, and had to be crushed near home before he could venture to deal with it on the remote outskirts of his empire. Meanwhile Hezekiah strengthened himself and built up a considerable power.

Sargon attacked Philistia in  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, made Gaza and the other towns subject, and committed the custody of them to tributary kings, in whom he had confidence. But opposition soon manifested itself. Sargon's creatures were expelled - Akhimiti from Ash-clod, Padi from Ekron. Hezekiah assisted in this war of independence, attacked Sargon's viceroys, and helped the cities to free themselves. About the year  <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon speaks of a league against Assyria, to which the parties were Philistia, Judaea, Edom, and Moab ('Eponym Canon,' p. 130). The Philistines, whom Hezekiah "smote," must be regarded as Assyrian partisans, whom he chastised in the interests of the national party. He did not seek conquests in Philistia for himself.

In contrast with Hezekiah's piety and consequent prosperity, the author places the disobedience (ver. 12) and consequent extinction of the sister kingdom (vers. 9-11), which Belonged to Hezekiah's earlier years, and was an event of the greatest importance to him, since it made his dominions conterminous with those of Assyria, and exposed his northern frontier to attack at any moment from the Assyrian forces. According to all probable human calculation, the fall of Samaria should have been followed <span class="accented">at once</span> by an attack on Judaea; and but for the change of dynasty, and troubles on all sides which ensued thereupon, this would naturally have taken place. As it was, Judaea was allowed a Breathing-space, during which she strengthened her power in Philistia (see the comment on the preceding verse), and otherwise prepared herself to resist attack (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah King of Israel.</span> Hezekiah Began to reign before Hoshea had completed his third year (ver. 1).

The writer now, as is his manner, omitting as comparatively unimportant all Hezekiah's dealings with Sargon, which were without positive result, proceeds to give a brief account of Sennacherib's first expedition against him, and of its unfortunate, if not disgraceful, issue: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the capture of all the important cities except Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the submission of Hezekiah to any terms which Sennacherib chose to impose; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the purchase of peace by the payment of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold out of the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace.

Sargon took Samaria in his first year,  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, and then had a reign of between seventeen and eighteen years, for fifteen of which we have his annals. He certainly did not associate Sennacherib with him on the throne, nor did the latter exercise any authority at all until  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, when, "on the 12th of Ab (July), he the throne ascended" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 67). Sennacherib places his first expedition against Hezekiah in his fourth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. Thus, according to the Assyrian records, which are very ample, and of which we have the actual originals, twenty years intervened between the capture of Samaria and the attack of Sennacherib on Hezekiah; according to the present passage, compared with vers. 9, 10, eight years only intervened. No contradiction can be more absolute. It has been proposed to alter the date from "the fourteenth year" to "the twenty-sixth year; ' but it seems most probable that the original writer inserted no date, but simply said, "And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up," etc., just as he had said, without a date, "Pul the King of Assyria came up against the land" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>); and "against him (Hoshea) came up Shalmaneser" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>); and, with a very vague date, if it may be called a date, "In the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>.

Later on, a redactor - perhaps the same who inserted the whole series of synchronisms - introduced the words, "In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah," having obtained the number from <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>, which he assumed to belong to the time of Sennacherib's attack. <span class="cmt_word">Against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.</span> Sennacherib himself says, "And of Hezekiah of Judah, who did not submit to my yoke, <span class="accented">forty-six</span> strong cities, fortresses, and smaller cities round about them without number, by the march of my troops... by the force of battering-rams, mining, and missiles, I besieged, I captured" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134, lines 6-12.

A bas-relief in the British Museum is thought to represent Sennacherib at the siege of Lachish. He is seated on a highly ornamented throne, and is engaged in receiving prisoners. The city is represented as strongly fortified, and as attacked with sealing-ladders and battering-rams. The surrender is taking place, and the captives of importance are being conducted from one of the tower-gates to the presence of the conqueror. An accompanying inscription is to the following effect: "Sennacherib, the great king, the King of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lakhisha (Lachish). I give permission for its destruction." It would seem that while Sennacherib was personally engaged in this siege, a portion of his army had invested Jerusalem, and were pressing the siege (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have offended; return from me.</span> The tone of the submission is abject. In vain had Isaiah counseled resistance, and promised deliverance if trust were placed in God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24, 25</a>). When the siege commenced, all was dismay within the walls - it was "a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). Some of the rulers fled (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>); others gave themselves up for lost, and resolved on "a short life and a merry one" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). Hezekiah found no encouragement to resist in any of his counselors except Isaiah, and was therefore driven to despair - acknowledged himself in the wrong for rebelling, and besought Sennacherib to "return from him" - <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> retire and withdraw his troops. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou puttest on me will I bear.</span> Whatever burden Sennacherib chooses to put upon him, Hezekiah says he will bear, be it tribute, be it cession of territory, be it indignity of any sort or kind. He makes no reservation; but of course he assumes that the terms about to be offered him will be such as, according in the usages of war at the time, would be regarded as reasonable. <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah King of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> Sennacherib says that the payment made him by Hezekiah was thirty talents of gold and <span class="accented">eight</span> hundred talents of silver ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, line 34). He has, perhaps, exaggerated, or he may have counted in all the silver that he carried off from the whole of Judaea; or, possibly, the payment to purchase peace was eight hundred talents, the fixed tribute three hundred. We learn from Sennacherib's inscription that, besides making this money payment, Hezekiah had to consent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a cession of territory towards the south-west, which was apportioned between Gaza, Ekron, and Ash-deal; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the surrender of an Assyrian vassal king, detained in Jerusalem; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the contribution to the harem at Nineveh of two if not more of his daughters.

To make up the "thirty talents of gold" he was now obliged to undo his own work, and strip the doors and pillars bare. Sennacherib tells us that, besides the two large sums of gold and silver, Hezekiah sent him at this time "woven cloth, scarlet,' embroidered; precious stones of large size; couches of ivory; movable thrones of ivory; skins of buffaloes; horns of buffaloes; and two kinds of woods" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, lines 34-37).

The Assyrian inscriptions are absolutely silent with respect to this expedition and its result - it being a fixed rule with the historiographers of Assyria to pass over without notice all defeats and disasters. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.</span> Sennacherib appears, by his great inscription, to have returned to Nineveh, with his Judaean captives (more than two hundred thousand in number) and his rich booty, towards the close of the year  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. In the following year he was called into Babylonia, where troubles had broken out, and Hezekiah, left to himself, seems to have made up his mind to revolt, and <span class="accented">to</span> have called in the assistance of Egypt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). Sabatok was probably the nominal sovereign, but Tirhakah, who held his court at Meres, was lord paramount. An alliance was made; and hopes held out that, if Sennacherib again marched into Judaea, Hezekiah would receive effectual aid, especially in chariots and horsemen (ver. 24). Under these circumstances, Sennacherib made his second expedition, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>. Regarding Egypt as his main enemy, and Judaea as of small account, he led his army by the ordinary route into the Philistian plain, pressing southward, while he detached a moderato force to hold Jerusalem in check, to threaten it, and, if an opportunity offered, to seize it. At the head of this force were three commanders, who seem to have borne, all of them, official titles; viz. the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "chief cupbearer." The Tartan was the highest of all the officials of the empire, and ranked next to the king. Sennacherib detached this force from Lachish, which seems to have revolted, and to have been undergoing a second siege. <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool.</span> It was, perhaps, this army which Isaiah saw in vision, advancing on Jerusalem from the pass of Michmash (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>), and "shaking its hand" at the city from the northern plateau outside the walls - the traditional "camp of the Assyrians." At any rate, the "upper pool" and the" fuller's field" were in this direction (see the comment on Isaiah 7:3). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</span>

(For another view, see the comment on 1 Kings 4:3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rabshakeh said unto them.</span> Although the third in order of dignity, Rabshakeh took the word, probably because he was familiar with the Hebrew language, and could speak it fluently (see ver. 26). His being spokesman made him appear to be the chief ambassador, and made Isaiah, in the parallel passage (36.), pass over in silence the other two. <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye now to Hezekiah.</span> It was a rude, almost an insulting commencement, to give Hezekiah no title - neither "the king," nor "King of Judah," nor even "your master," but to call him merely "Hezekiah." The same rudeness is persisted in throughout (vers. 22, 29, 30, 31, 32), and it is emphasized by the employment of some title or other, generally a lofty title, when Sennacherib is spoken cf. Sennacherib himself is less rude in his inscriptions (see the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, line 45; 134, line 6; 136, lines 21, 15). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the great king, the King of Assyria.</span> The "great king" - <span class="accented">sarru rabu</span> - was the ordinary title assumed by Assyrian monarchs. It passed from them to the Babylonians and the Persians. Sennacherib calls himself, on Bellino's cylinder," the great king, the powerful king, the King of Assyria, the king unrivalled, the pious monarch, the worshipper of the great gods, the protector of the just, the lover of the righteous, the noble warrior, the valiant hero, the first of all kings, the great punisher of unbelievers" (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 25). <span class="cmt_word">What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</span> We may assume that Hezekiah had, at the beginning of the year, withheld his tribute. He had certainly not gone out to meet the "great king" as he approached his territories, to do homage, and place the forces of Judah at his disposal. On the contrary, he had taken up an attitude of hostility. He had fortified his capital (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2-5</a>); he had collected arms and soldiers, and had shut himself up in Jerusalem, having made every preparation for a siege. Sennacherib inquires why he has dared to do all this - on what strength does he rely? What is the ground of his confidence?

We must suppose that Sennacherib has either heard from his spies that Hezekiah is speaking to the people as he represents him to be speaking, or conjectures what he is likely to say. According to the writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7, 8</a>), what he did say was very different. He neither boasted of "counsel" nor of material "strength;" but simply said, "There be more with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles." <span class="cmt_word">I have counsel and strength for the war.</span> Sennacherib imagines that Hezekiah's real trust is in the "fleshly arm" of Egypt, and in the counselors who have advised and brought about the alliance. And perhaps he is not far wrong. Hezekiah, it would seem, "halted between two opinions." He hoped for aid from Egypt; but, if it failed, then he hoped for the Divine help promised by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</span>

Hezekiah's embassy to Egypt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>) was known to him; and he rightly judged that Hezekiah was expecting aid from this quarter. This expectation he ridicules. What is Egypt but a "bruised reed"? The Nile bulrush (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5e5;</span>) has a goodly show; it rears itself aloft, and leeks strong and stately; but use it as a staff, lean upon it, and it snaps at once. Such is Pharaoh - nay, he is worse; he is a <span class="accented">bruised</span> reed, which can give no support at all, even for a moment. The Assyrian monarch was justified in his contempt. Egypt had never yet given any effectual support to the states attacked by Assyria Shebek gave no manner of aid to Hoshea, but allowed Samaria to be conquered in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> without making the slightest effort on her behalf. In  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> he came to the aid of Gaza ('Eponym Canon,' p. 126), but Gaza was captured notwithstanding. In  <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> either he or Sabatok undertook the protection of Ashdod, but with the same lack of success (ibid., pp. 130, 131). "Kings of Egypt" assisted the Ascalonites against Sennacherib himself in  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>, and were again completely defeated (ibid., pp. 133, 134). Sargon calls the King of Egypt, whoso aid was invited by the Ashdedites (ibid., p. 130, line 37), "a monarch who could not save them." <span class="cmt_word">On which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> trust in Egypt will not only bring a country no advantage, but it will bring positive injury.

No doubt he thought it purely fantastical and illusory. But he was not unaware that it might inspire a determined resistance. He therefore condescended to argue against reliance on it. <span class="cmt_word">Is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away?</span> His counselors have suggested to Sennacherib a specious argument - How can Hezekiah confidently rely on the protection of the God of the land, Jehovah, when he has been employing himself for years in the destruction of this very God's high places and altars? Surely the God will not favor one who has been pulling down his places of worship! Putting out of sight the special requirements of the Jewish Law, the argument might well seem unanswerable. At any rate, it was calculated to have a certain effect on the minds of those who were attached to the high-place worship, and desired its continuance. <span class="cmt_word">And hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem.</span> A weak argument, if addressed to Jews of Jerusalem only, but likely to have weight with the country Jews, if, as is probable, they had crowded into the city when the invasion began.

It is difficult to account for Sennacherib's very exceptional boast, "Jehovah said to me. Go up against this laud." Perhaps he identifies "Jehovah" with "Asshur." Perhaps he has heard of prophecies, uttered in the name of Jehovah, by Jewish prophets, which threatened the land with desolation at the hand of the Assyrians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>, etc.).

Rabshakeh had addressed the Jewish officials in Hebrew, probably as the language which they would best understand, if it were not even the only one that they would understand; not with the express "object of influencing the common people," as Bahr supposes. But the Jewish officials feared that the words uttered were influencing them. They proposed, therefore, that the further negotiations should be conducted in Aramaic, a tongue which they understood, and one which they supposed that Rabshakeh, as he knew Hebrew, would also know.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27</a></div><div class="verse">But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? <i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall?</span> An intolerable speech on the part of an envoy, and one which might have justified an order to send an arrow through his head. Ambassadors are accredited by governments to governments, and the safe conduct granted to them is on the understanding that they will conduct themselves according to established usage. In no state of society can it have been allowable for envoys to intervene between the governors and the governed, and endeavor to stir up discontent among the latter. Yet this is what Rabshakeh did, and boasted of doing. Well might Isaiah say of such an arrogant and lawless aggressor, "He hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</span> Rabshakeh means to say that the effect of the men "sitting on the wall," and continuing the defense of the town, will be to bring them to the last extremity of hunger and thirst, when they will be forced even to consume their own excrement (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25-29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-28.htm">2 Kings 18:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with aloud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying.</span> Rabshakeh had probably been sitting before. He now stood up to attract attention, and raised his voice to be the better heard. Still speaking Hebrew, and not Aramaic, he addressed himself directly to the people on the wall, soldiers and others, doing the very opposite to what he had been requested to do, and outraging all propriety. History scarcely presents any other instance of such coarse and barefaced effrontery, unless the affronts put upon a Danubian principality by the envoy of a "great Power" may be regarded as constituting a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the great king, the King of Assyria.</span> It is scarcely likely that Sennacherib had anticipated his envoy's action, much less directed it, and told him exactly what he was to say. But Rabshakeh thinks his words will have more effect if he represents them as those of his master. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-29.htm">2 Kings 18:29</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you.</span> Rabshakeh and his master, no doubt, both of them thought Hezekiah's grounds of confidence would prove fallacious, and that all who should trust in them would find themselves "deceived." There were but two grounds that Hezekiah could possibly put forward: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> deliverance by human means - by his own armed strength and that of his allies; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> deliverance by supernatural means - by some great manifestation of miraculous power on the part of Jehovah. Rabshakeh thinks both equally impossible. The first, however, is too absurd for argument, and he therefore takes no further notice of it; but the second he proceeds to combat, in vers. 33-35. <span class="cmt_word">For he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</span> Correct grammar requires "out of my hand;" but Rabshakeh forgets that he is professing to report the words of Sennacherib. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-30.htm">2 Kings 18:30</a></div><div class="verse">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord.</span> Rabshakeh seems to be aware that this is the argument which Hezekiah is, in point of fact, mainly urging. If at one time he had trusted in Egypt, that trust was now quite or well-nigh gone. The tone of his exhortations was that recorded in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6-8</a>), "He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of Assyria, nor for all the multi-rude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him [see <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a>]; with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah King of Judah." <span class="cmt_word">Saying, The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria</span>. Hezekiah's was, in part, a general conviction that God would not forsake his people, who had recently turned to him, if not with absolute sincerity, yet at any rate with public confession of sin, and public acknowledgment of his mercies, and public profession of an intention to serve him; in part, probably, a special reliance on some definite prophecies of Isaiah, that the city should not be taken (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-6</a>; Isaiah 34:20-22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a></div><div class="verse">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me by a present, and come out to me, and <i>then</i> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the King of Assyria.</span> Rabshakeh, before concluding, tries the effect of blandishments. The King of Assyria is no harsh lord, as he has been represented to them. He will be a kinder master than Hezekiah. Hezekiah condemns them to all the hardships of a siege; and then, if they survive it, to a wasted land, ruined homes, broken cisterns. Sennacherib, if they will but yield to him, promises them peace and prosperity, a time of quiet enjoyment in their own land, and then removal to another equally good, where they will "live and not die," be happy and not miserable. It will be observed that none but material inducements are held out to them. They are expected to barter freedom, independence, religious privileges, country, home, for the sake of creature comforts - for ease, quiet, and security. Setting aside the question whether they could count on the performance of the promises made them, it will be felt that they did well not to be tempted. Better vigorous national life, with any amount of hardship, struggle, and suffering, than the gilded chains of the most peaceful servitude. <span class="cmt_word">Make an agreement with me by a present</span> - rather, <span class="accented">make peace with me</span>, or "make <span class="accented">terms</span> with me" (Knobel, Thenius, Keil, Bahr); in other words, give in your submission - <span class="cmt_word">and come out to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quit the town, surrender it (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>), place yourselves at my mercy, "and then" see what great things I will do for you."

Rabshakeh promises, in the name of Sennacherib, that they shall rest in their own land for a term - an indefinite term - in a blissful state of peace and quietness before any new resolution is taken about them. <span class="cmt_word">And drink ye every one the waters of his cistern</span>; rather, of <span class="accented">his</span> well (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>).

Probably he felt that, if he did, he would not be believed. The transplantations had been too numerous and too recent, the examples of Samaria, Damascus, Hamath, Ashdod, etc., were too notorious, for it to be worth his while to pretend that Judaea would have any other fate. He therefore set himself the task of persuading the Jews that transplantation had nothing about it displeasing or even disagreeable - that, in fact, they were to be envied rather than pitied for being about to experience it. The King of Assyria, in the goodness of his paternal breast, would select for them a land as nearly as possible "like their own land" - a land teeming with corn and wine and oil, full of rich arable tracts, of vineyards and of olive-grounds, which would yield them those fruits of the earth to which they were accustomed, in abundance. What security they had that these promises would be fulfilled, he did not attempt to show them; much less did he explain to them why, if they were to gain rather than lose, it was worth while transplanting them at all; how that transplanted nations lost all spirit and patriotism, sank into apathy, and gave no trouble to their masters. <span class="cmt_word">A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8, 9</a>, which has, no doubt, affected the language of the reporter, who gives the general tenor of Rabshakeh's speech, but could not have taken down or have remembered his exact words) <span class="cmt_word">that ye may live, and not die</span> - as you win if you follow Hezekiah's advice  - <span class="cmt_word">and [therefore] hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seeketh to persuade  - <span class="cmt_word">you, saying, The Lord will deliver us</span> (see the comment on ver. 30).

It had all the force of what appeared to them a complete induction. As far back as they could remember, they had always been contending with different tribes and nations, each and all of whom had had gods in whom they trusted, and the result had been uniform - the gods had been unequal to the task of protecting their votaries against Assyria: how could it be imagined that Jehovah would prove an exception? If he was not exactly, as Knobel calls him, "the insignificant god of an insignificant people," yet how was he better or stronger than the others - than Chemosh, or Moloch, or Rim-moll, or Baal, or Ashima, or Khaldi, or Bel, or Merodach? What had he done for the Jews hitherto? Nothing remarkable, so far as the Assyrians knew; for their memories did not reach back so far as the time of Asa and the deliverance from Zerah, much less to the conquest of Canaan or the Exodus. He had not 'saved the trans-Jordanic tribes from Tiglath-pileser, or Samaria from his successors. Was it not madness to suppose that he would save Judaea from Sennacherib? A heathen reasoner could not see, could not be expected to see, the momentous difference; that the gods of the other countries were "no gods" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>), while Jehovah was "the Lord of the whole earth." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a></div><div class="verse">Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?</span> Hamath and Arpad had been recently conquered (about  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>) by Sargon (see the 'Epouym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Of the latter city but little is known, net even its site. We find it generally connected with Damascus (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' pp. 68, 126) and Hamath (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' p. 126), and may conjecture that it lay between them, either in Coele-Syria or in the Anti-Libanus.

"Hena," mentioned always with Sepharvaim and Ivah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>), is probably Allah on the Euphrates, about seventy miles above Hit (Ivah). Nothing is known of its gods. Probably Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah had rebelled in conjunction, and been re-conquered at no distant date. Sargon mentions in his annals that he besieged and took Sepharvaim (Sippara) in his twelfth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</span> There is probably some compression of the original narrative here. The meaning is, "Have they delivered their several cities, or has the god of Samaria delivered his city out of my hand?" No god had hitherto delivered any city which the Assyrians had attacked.

If, then, he had hoped to bring about a mutiny, or even to create a disturbance, he was disappointed. <span class="cmt_word">For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</span> Hezekiah had either anticipated Rabshakeh's tactics, and given an order beforehand that no word should be uttered, or he had promptly met them by sending such an order, on learning Rabshakeh's proceedings, The latter is more probable, since such an outrageous course as that which Rabshakeh had pursued can scarcely have been expected.

They were blasphemies, no doubt, arising from "invincible ignorance," and not intended as insults to the one Almighty Being who rules the earth, of whose existence Rabshakeh had probably no conception; but they struck on Jewish ears as insults to Jehovah, and therefore as dreadful and horrible (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And told him the words of Rabshakeh</span>; reported to him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as nearly as they could, all that Rabshakeh had said.

The crisis of Hezekiah's life was reached. As he acted under it would be fixed his own fate, his character in the judgment of all future time, and the fate of his own country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
