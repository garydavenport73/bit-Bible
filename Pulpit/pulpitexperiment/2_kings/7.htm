It must be remembered that the prophet's life was trembling in the balance. The executioner was present; the king had not revoked his order; the elders would probably have suffered the king to work his will. All depended on Elisha, by half a dozen words, changing the king's mind. He therefore announces a Divine oracle (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; and for the exact expression, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-4.htm">Jeremiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure</span> - literally, a <span class="accented">seah</span> - of fine flour be sold for a shekel. The "seah" was probably about equal to a peck and a half English, the shekel of the time to about half a crown. Thus no extraordinary cheapness is promised, but only an enormous fall in prices from the rate current at the moment (2 Kings 7:25). Such a fall implied, almost necessarily, the discontinuance of the siege. Jehoram appears to have accepted the prophet's solemn asseveration, and on the strength of it to have spared his life, at any rate till the result should be seen. <span class="cmt_word">And two measures</span> - literally, <span class="accented">seahs - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</span> The gates, or rather gateways, of Oriental towns were spacious places, where business of various kinds was transacted. One at Nineveh had an area of above two thousand five hundred square feet. Kings often held their courts of justice in the city gates. On this occasion one of the gates of Samaria seems to have been used as a corn-market (comp. vers. 17-20).

But the officer on whose arm he leans is not so reticent. Utterly incredulous, he expresses his incredulity in a scoffing way: "Could this possibly be, even if God were to 'make windows in heaven,' as he did at the time of the Flood (<a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), and pour through them, instead of rain, as then, a continual shower of fine meal and corn?" Disbelief is expressed, not only in the prophetic veracity of Elisha, but in the power of God. Hence Elisha's stern reply. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span> At once a threat and a warning. If the thing was to be, and the lord to see it and yet not profit by it, the only reasonable conclusion was that his death was imminent. He was thus warned, and given time to "set his house in order," and to repent and make his peace with the Almighty. Whether he took advantage of the warning, or even understood it, we are not told. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-16.</span> - The mode in which Elisha's prophecy of relief and deliverance was fulfilled is now set forth. Four lepers, excluded from the city, and on the point of perishing of hunger, felt that they could be no worse off, and might better their condition, if they deserted to the Syrians. They therefore drew off from the city at nightfall, and made for the Syrian camp. On arriving, they found it deserted. The entire host, seized with a sudden panic, had fled, about the time that they began their journey. The lepers' first thought was to enrich themselves by plunder, but after a while it occurred to them that, unless they hastened to carry the good news to Samaria, inquiry would be made, their proceedings would be found out, and they would be severely punished. So they returned to the capital, and reported what they had discovered. Jehoram, on receiving the news, feared that the Syrians had prepared a trap for him, and declined to move. He consented, however, to send out scouts to reconnoiter. The scouts found evident proof that the entire army had actually fled and was gone, whereupon there was a general raid upon the camp and its stores, which were so abundant that Elisha's prophecy was fulfilled ere the day ended. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate</span>; or, at the <span class="accented">entrance to the gate-house</span>. Lepers were forbidden by the Law to reside within cities (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/5-3.htm">Numbers 5:3</a>). They were thrust out when the disease developed itself, and forced to dwell without the walls. No doubt their friends within the city ordinarily supplied them with food; and hence they congregated about the city gates. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</span> In the extreme scarcity, it is probable that no food was brought to them, the inmates of the city having barely enough wherewith to sustain themselves (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>). Thus they were on the point of perishing.

They ask themselves, however, "Cut bone?" What will he the use of it? The famine is inside the town no less than outside. If they entered the city, by hook or by crook, it would only be to "die there" <span class="cmt_word">And if we sit still here, we die also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">if we remain here</span>, or, <span class="accented">if we dwell here</span>.

How the noise was produced it is impossible to say. Na-rural causes are insufficient; and the writer evidently regards the event as miraculous: "The <span class="accented">Lord had made</span> the host of the Syrians to hear a noise," etc. Nothing can be more weak and irrelevant than to remark, with Bahr," There are instances, even nowadays, that people in certain mountainous regions regard a rushing and roaring sound, such as is sometimes heard there, as a sign of coming war." The Syrians thought they heard the actual arrival of a vast army. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Lo, the King of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites.</span> This supposition has been thought "strange," almost inexplicable. "No such nation as the Hittites any longer existed," says Mr. Sumner ('The Books of the Kings,' vol. 2. p. 72, Eng. trans.). But the Assyrian records of the  <span class="date">ninth and eighth centuries B.C.</span> make it evident, not only that the Hittites still existed at that date, but that they were among the most powerful enemies of the Ninevite kings, being located in Northern Syria, about Carchemish (Jerabus) and the adjacent country. It is also apparent that they did not form a centralized monarchy, but were governed by a number of chiefs, or "kings," twelve of whom are mentioned in one place (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 112). It was no very improbable supposition on the part of the Syrians that Jehoram had called in the aid of the Hittite confederacy, and that they had marched an army to his assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the Egyptians.</span> "The plural, kings of the Egyptians," says Keil, "is not to be pressed. It is probably occasioned only by the parallel expression,' kings of the Hittites.'" But Egyptian history shows us that about this date Egypt was becoming disintegrated, and that two or three distinct dynasties were sometimes ruling at the same time, in different parts of the country - one at Bubastis another at Thebes, a third at Tanis, occasionally a fourth at Memphis (see "Ancient Egypt," in 'The Story of the Nations,' p. 311). The writer thus shows a knowledge of the internal condition of Egypt which we should not have expected. To come upon us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to fall upon us from the north and from the south at the same time. In their panic, the Syrians did not stop to weigh probabilities, or to think how unlikely it was that such a simultaneous attack could have been arranged between powers so remote one from the other.

So Darius Hystaspis, when he began his retreat from Scythia (Herod., 4:135), left his camp standing, and the camp fires lighted, and the asses tethered (see ver. 10), that the Scythians, seeing the tents and hearing the noise of the animals, might be fully persuaded that his troops were still in the same place. Asses were the chief baggage-animals in many ancient armies. <span class="cmt_word">And fled for their life.</span> Thinking that, if they waited till dawn, the Israelite allies, Hittites and Egyptians, would exterminate them.

Then their covetousness was excited by the riches exposed to view in the tent. <span class="cmt_word">And carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment.</span> Oriental armies carried with them vast quantities of the precious metals, in the shape of gold and silver vases, goblets, dishes, as well as in collars, chains, furniture, and trappings. Herodotus says (9:80) that, when the camp of Mardonius at Plataea fell into the hands of the Greeks, there were found in it "many tents richly adorned with furniture of gold and silver, many couches covered with plates of the same, and many golden bowls, goblets, and other drinking-vessels. On the carriages were bags containing gold and silver kettles; and the bodies of the slain furnished bracelets and chains, and scimitars with golden ornaments - not to mention era-broidered apparel, of which no one made any account." The camp of the Syrians would scarcely have been so richly provided; but still it contained, no doubt, a large amount of very valuable plunder. <span class="cmt_word">And went and hid it.</span> The lepers had no right to the pick of the spoil. It belonged to the nation, and it was probably the king's right to apportion it. The lepers had to conceal what they appropriated, lest it should he taken from them. <span class="cmt_word">And came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</span> Plundering thus probably, not two tents only, but several.

The employment of chariots instead of horsemen is remarkable, and seems to indicate that with the Israelites, as with the Egyptians, the chariot force was regarded as superior to the cavalry for practical purposes. <span class="cmt_word">And the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</span> The advice of the king's "servant" was taken; a couple of chariots were sent out to reconnoiter.

Convinced by what they saw that the Syrians had really withdrawn into their own country, they pursued no further, but returned to Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.</span> Cloaks, shawls, shields, and even swords and spears, would be cast away as <span class="accented">impedimenta - hindrances</span> to a rapid flight.

At the same time, no doubt, they feasted on the abundant dainties which they found in the tents. Having satisfied their immediate wants, they proceeded to lay in a store of corn for future use, and crowded tumultuously into the gate, where the corn found in the camp was being sold. <span class="cmt_word">So a measure of fine flour</span>; rather, and a <span class="accented">measure</span>, etc. - <span class="cmt_word">was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord</span> (see ver. 1).

Probably there was no thought of the post being one of danger. <span class="cmt_word">And the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.</span> It has been questioned whether the death was accidental (Bahr), and suggested that the eager and famished people resisted his authority, and violently bore down his attempts to control them. But there is nothing in the text that is incompatible with an accidental death. Such deaths ate not uncommon in dense crowds of anxious and excited people. <span class="cmt_word">As the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</span> The varieties of reading here do not affect the general sense. The writer's intention is to lay special stress on the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy; and to emphasize the punishment that follows on a lack of faith. The concluding passage of the chapter is, as Bahr says, "a finger of warning to unbelievers."
