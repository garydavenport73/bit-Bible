In the whole range of the history contained in the two Books of the Kings, there is no instance of the year, month, and day being all given excepting in the present chapter, where we find this extreme exactness three times (vers. 1, 4, and 8). The date in ver. 1 is confirmed by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem</span>. 'According to the description of the eye-witness, Jeremiah, the army was one of unusual magnitude.

The march of the army was not direct upon Jerusalem; it at first spread itself over Judea, wasting the country and capturing the smaller fortified towns (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect;3)  - among them Lachish, so famous in the war against Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>), and Azekah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>). The capture of these two places was important as intercepting Zedekiah's line of communication with Egypt. Having made himself master of them, Nebuchadnezzar proceeded to invest the capital. <span class="cmt_word">And pitched against it</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, encamped, and commenced a regular siege - <span class="cmt_word">and they built forts against it round about.</span> It has been argued that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> does not mean a "fort" or "tower," but a "line of circumvallation" (Michaelis, Hitzig, Thenius, Bahr). Jerusalem, however, can scarcely be surrounded by lines of circumvallation, which, moreover, were not employed in their sieges by the Orientals. <span class="accented">Dayek</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>) seems to be properly a "watchtower," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">speculari</span>, whence it passed into the meaning of a "tower" generally. The towers used in sieges by the Assyrians and Babylonians were movable ones, made of planks, which were pushed up to the walls, so that the assailants might attack their adversaries, on a level, with greater advantage. Sometimes they contained battering rams (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 19; and setup. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-2.htm">2 Kings 25:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah</span>. The writer omits all the details of the siege, and hastens to the final catastrophe. From Jeremiah and Ezekiel we learn that, after the siege had continued a certain time, the Egyptian monarch, Hophra or Apries, made an effort to carry out the terms of his agreement with Zedekiah, and marched an army into Southern Judaea, with the view of raising the siege (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). Nebuchadnezzar hastened to meet him. With the whole or the greater part of his host he marched southward and offered battle to the Egyptians. Whether an engagement took place or not is uncertain. Josephus affirms it, and says that Apries was "defeated and driven out of Syria" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 3). The silence of Jeremiah is thought to throw doubt on his assertion. At any rate, the Egyptians retired (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>) and took no further part in the struggle. The Babylonians returned, and the siege recommenced. A complete blockade was established, and the defenders of the city soon began to suffer from famine (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12, 20</a>). Ere long, as so often happens in sieges, famine was followed by pestilence (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6, 7</a>; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), and after a time the place was reduced to the last extremity (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-9</a>). Bread was no longer to be had, and mothers devoured their children (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). At length a breach was effected in the defenses; the enemy poured in; and the city fell (see the comment on ver. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a></div><div class="verse">And on the ninth <i>day</i> of the <i>fourth</i> month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And on the ninth day of the fourth month.</span> The text of Kings is here incomplete, and has to be restored from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>. Our translators have supplied the missing words. <span class="cmt_word">The famine prevailed in the city</span> (see the comment on ver. 2). As I have elsewhere observed, "The intensity of the suffering endured may be gathered from Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Josephus. The complexions of the men grew black with famine (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-10.htm">Lamentations 5:10</a>); their skin was shrunk and parched (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>); the rich and noble women searched the dunghills for setups of offal (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>); the children perished for want, or were even devoured by their parents (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3, 4, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>); water was scarce, as well as food, and was sold at a price (<a href="../../par/lamentations/5-4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>); third part of the inhabitants died of the famine, and the plague which grew out of it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>)" (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. p. 147). <span class="cmt_word">And there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> Bread commonly fails comparatively early in a siege. It was some time before the fall of the city that Ebed-Meleeh expressed his fear that Jeremiah would starve, since there was no more bread in the place (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the city was broken up, and all the men of war <i>fled</i> by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which <i>is</i> by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees <i>were</i> against the city round about:) and <i>the king</i> went the way toward the plain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city was broken up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">brown into</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a breach was made in the walls. Probably the breach was on the north side of the city, where the ground is nearly level (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 2), the enemy entered through the breach about midnight. <span class="cmt_word">And all the men of war</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all the soldiers who formed the garrison - <span class="cmt_word">fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls</span>; rather, <span class="accented">between the two walls</span>, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>. As the enemy broke in on the north, the king and garrison quitted the city on the south by a gate which opened into the Tyropoeon valley, between the two walls that guarded the town on either side of it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is by the king's garden.</span> The royal gardens were situated near the Pool of Siloam, at the mouth of the Tyrepoeon, and near the junction of the Hinnom with the Kidron valley (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 7:11). (<span class="cmt_word">Now the Chaldees were against the city round about.</span>) The town, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">was</span> guarded on all sides by Chaldean troops, so that Zedekiah and his soldiers must either have attacked the line of guard, and broken through it, or have slipped between two of the blockading pests under cover of the darkness. As no collision is mentioned, either here or in Jeremiah, the latter seems the more probable supposition. <span class="cmt_word">And the king went the way toward the plain</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and he</span> '<span class="accented">went</span>. The writer supposes that his readers will understand that the king left the city with his troops; and so regards "he went" as sufficiently intelligible. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a> has "they went. By "the plain" (literally, "the Arabsh") the valley of the Jordan is intended, and by "the way" to it the ordinary road from Jerusalem to Jericho. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king.</span> When the escape of Zedekiah and the soldiers of the garrison was discovered, hot pursuit was made, since the honor of the great king required that his enemies should be brought captive to his presence. The commanders at Jerusalem would fuel this the more sensibly, since Nebuchadnezzar had for some time retired from the siege, and left its conduct to them, while he himself exercised a general superintendence over military affairs from Riblah (see ver. 6). They were liable to be held responsible for the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And overtook him in the plains of Jericho.</span> The "plains of Jericho" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>) is the fertile tract on the right bank of the Jordan near its embouchure, which was excellently watered, and cultivated in gardens, orchards, and palm-groves. It is probable, though not certain, that Zedekiah intended to cross the Jordan, and seek a refuge in Moab. <span class="cmt_word">And all his army were scattered from him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>). This seems to be mentioned in order to account for there being no engagement. Perhaps, thinking themselves in security, and imagining that they were not followed, the troops had dispersed themselves among the farmhouses and homesteads, to obtain a much-needed refreshment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they took the king</span> [Zedekiah], <span class="cmt_word">and brought him up to the King of Babylon.</span> The presentation of rebel kings, when captured, to their suzerain, seated on his throne, is one of the most common subjects of Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 292; vol. 3. p. 7; Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pls. 23, 36, etc.). The Egyptian and Persian artists also represent it. To Riblah. (For the situation of Riblah, see the comment on 2 Kings 23:33.) As Nebuchadnezzar was engaged at one and the same time in directing the sieges both of Tyro and of Jerusalem, it was a most convenient position for him to occupy. <span class="cmt_word">And they gave judgment upon him.</span> As a rebel, who had broken his covenant and his oath (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16, 18</a>), Zedekiah was brought to trial before Nebuchadnezzar and his great lords. The facts could not be denied, and sentence was therefore passed upon him, nominally by the court, practically by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). By an unusual act of clemency, his life was spared; but the judgment was still sufficiently severe (see the next verse). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes</span> (comp. Herod., 3:14, and 2 Macc. 7, for similar aggravations of condemned persons' sufferings). As Zedekiah was no more than thirty-two years of age (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), his sons must have been minors, who could not justly be held responsible for their father's doings. It was usual, however, in the East, and even among the Jews, to punish children for the sins of their fathers (see <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And put out the eyes of Zedekiah.</span> This, too, was a common Oriental practice. The Philistines blinded Samson (<a href="../../par/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Sargon, in one of his sculptures, seems to be blinding a prisoner with a spear (Botta, 'Monumens de Ninive,' pl. 18). The ancient Persians often blinded criminals (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:9. &sect; 13; Ammian. Mare., 27:12; Procop., 'De Bell. Pers.,' 1:11. p. 80). In modern Persia, it was, until very lately, usual for a king, on his accession, to blind all his brothers, in order that they might be disqualified from reigning. The operation was commonly performed in Persia by means of a red-hot iron rod (see Herod., 7:18). Zedekiah's loss of eyesight reconciled the two apparently conflicting prophecies - that he would be carried captive to Babylon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, etc.), and that he would never see it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) - in a remarkable manner. <span class="cmt_word">And bound him with fetters of brass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with a pair of brazen fetters</span>. Assyrian fetters consisted of two thick rings of iron, joined together by a single long link (Botta, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>); Babylonian were probably similar. Captives of importance are usually represented as fettered in the sculptures. <span class="cmt_word">And carried him to Babylon.</span> Jeremiah adds (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar "put him in prison till the day of his death:" and so Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 7). The latter writer further tells us that, at his death, the Babylonian monarch gave him a royal funeral (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">And in the fifth month, on the seventh <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>is</i> the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the fifth month, on the seventh clay of the month.</span> Jeremiah says (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>) that it was on the <span class="accented">tenth</span> day of the month; and so Josephus (Bell Jud. Jud. 6:4. &sect; 8). The mistake probably arose from a copyist mistaking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> (ten) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> (seven). According to Josephus, it was on the same day of the same month that the final destruction of the temple by the soldiers of Titus was accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon.</span> Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span>, which was the fourth year of Jehoiakim, who began to reign in  <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>.

He was probably led to destroy the city by the length of the resistance, and the natural strength of the position. The name, Nebuzar-adan, is probably a Hebraized form of the Babylonian Nebu-sar-iddina. "Nebo has given (us) a king." <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the guard</span>; literally <span class="accented">chief of the executioners</span>; but as the King's guard were employed to execute his commissions, and especially his death-sentences, the paraphrase is quite allowable. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of the King of Babylon</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a subject - <span class="cmt_word">unto Jerusalem.</span> He came doubtless with <span class="accented">instructions</span>, which he proceeded to carry out.

Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 5), four hundred and seventy years six months and ten days. This calculation, however, seems to exceed the truth. Neither the Assyrians nor the Babylonians had any regard for the gods of other nations. They everywhere burnt the temples, plundered the shrines, and carried off the images as trophies of victory. In the temple of Jerusalem they would find no images except those of the two cherubim (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>), which they probably took away with them. <span class="cmt_word">And the king's house</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1, 8-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>). The royal palace was, perhaps, almost as magnificent as the temple; and its destruction was almost as great a loss to art. It doubtless contained Solomon's throne of ivory (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>), to which there was an ascent by six steps, with two sculptured lions on each step. <span class="cmt_word">And all the houses of Jerusalem.</span> This statement is qualified by the words of the following clause, which show that only the houses of the princes and great men were purposely set on fire.

Having burnt the temple, the royal palace, and the grand residences of the principal citizens, Nebuzar-adan proceeded to divide the inhabitants of the city and country into two bodies - those whom he would leave in the land, and those whom he would carry off. The line of demarcation was, in a general way, a social one. The rich and well-to-do he would take with him; the poor and insignificant he would leave behind (vers. 11, 12). Among the former were included the high priest, the "second priest," three of the temple Levites, the commandant of the city, a certain number of the royal councilors, the "principal scribe of the host," and sixty of the "princes" (vers. 18, 19). The latter were chiefly persons of the agricultural class, who were left to be "vinedressers and husbandmen."

Having reached Riblah, where Nebuchadnezzar still was, he delivered up to him both the booty and the prisoners. Rather more than seventy of the latter Nebuchadnezzar punished with death (ver. 21).

The Assyrian sculptures show us prisoners of war impaled on crosses, beheaded, beaten on the head with maces, and sometimes extended on the ground and flayed. The inscriptions speak of hundreds as thus executed, and mention others as burnt in furnaces, or thrown to wild beasts, or cruelly mutilated. Herodotus says (3. 159) that Darius Hystaspis crucified three thousand prisoners round about Babylon after one of its revolts. That monarch himself, in the Behistun inscription, speaks of many cases where, after capturing rebel chiefs in the field or behind walls, he executed them and their principal adherents (see <a href="../../par/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>. Par. 13; <a href="../../par/colossians/3.htm">Colossians 3</a>. Par. 8, 11).

Nebuchadnezzar, when he carried off Zedekiah to Babylon, appointed, as governor of Judaea, a certain Gedaliah, a Jew of good position, but not of the royal family. Gedaliah made Mizpah, near Jerusalem, his residence; and here he was shortly joined by a number of Jews of importance, who had escaped from Jerusalem and hidden themselves until the Babylonians were gone. Of these the most eminent were Johanan the son of Karcah, and Ishmael, a member of the royal house of David. Gedaliah urged the refugees to be good subjects of the King of Babylon, and to settle themselves to agricultural pursuits. His advice was accepted and at first followed; but presently a warning was given to Gedaliah by Johanan that Ishmael designed his destruction; and soon afterwards, as Gedaliah took no precautions, the murder was actually carried out. Other atrocities followed; but after a time Johanan and the other leading refugees took up arms, forced Ishmael to fly to the Ammonites, and then, fearing that Nebuchadnezzar would hold them responsible for Ishmael's act, against Jeremiah's remonstrances, fled, with the great mass of the Jews that had been left in the land, from Judaea into Egypt.

Nebuchadnezzar's choice of Gedaliah for governor was probably made from some knowledge of his having sided with Jeremiah, whose persistent endeavors to make the Jews submit to the Babylonian yoke seem to have been well known, not only to the Jews, but to the Babylonians; most likely by reason of the letter he sent to his countrymen already in captivity (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shaphan, ruler.</span> Probably not "Shaphan the scribe" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3, 12</a>), but an unknown person of the same name.

When Ishmael and his ten companions arrived, he still suspected nothing, but received them hospitably (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1</a>), entertained them at a grand banquet, according to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:9. &sect; 4), and being overtaken with drunkenness, was attacked and killed without difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">And the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>, "Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found them, and the men of war"). It is evident from this that Gedaliah had a Chaldean guard.

The leader of the movement was Johanan, the son of Careah. Having first attacked Ishmael, and forced him to fly to the Ammonites (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>), he almost immediately afterwards conceived a fear of Nebuchadnezzar, who would, he thought, resent the murder of Gedaliah, and even avenge it upon these who had done all they could to prevent it. He therefore gathered together the people, and made a preliminary retreat to Chimham, near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), on the road to Egypt, whence he subsequently, against the earnest remonstrances and prophetic warnings of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9-22</a>, carried them on into Egypt itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-7</a>).

There does not appear to have been any real reason for this fear. Nebuchadnezzar might have been trusted to distinguish between the act of an individual and conspiracy on the part of the nation.

He therefore mentions, as his last incident, the fate of Jehoiachin, who, after thirty-six years of a cruel and seemingly hopeless imprisonment, experienced a happy change of circumstances. The king who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar, his son, Evil-Merodach, in the first year of his sovereignty had compassion upon the miserable captive, and releasing him from prison, changed his garments (ver. 29), and gave him a place at his table, among other dethroned monarchs, even exalting him above the rest (ver. 28), and making him an allowance for his support (ver. 30). This alleviation of their king's condition could not but be felt by the captive Jews as a happy omen - a portent of the time when their lot too would be alleviated, and the Almighty Disposer of events, having punished them sufficiently for their sins, would relent at last, and put an end to their banishment, and give them rest and peace in their native country. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin King of Judah.</span> According to Berosus and the Canon of Ptolemy, Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-four years. He carried off Jehoiachin to Babylon in his eighth year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>), and thus the year of his death would exactly coincide with the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of the Jewish prince. <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month.</span> The <span class="accented">five</span> and twentieth day, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, (On the rarity of such exact dates in the historical Scriptures, see the comment on ver. 1.) <span class="cmt_word">That Evil-Merodach King of Babylon.</span> The native name, which is thus expressed, seems to have been "Avil-Marduk." The meaning of <span class="accented">avil</span> is uncertain; but the name probably placed the prince under the protection of Merodach, who was Nebuchadnezzar's favorite god. Avil-Marduk ascended the Babylonian throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and reigned two years only, when he was murdered by Neriglissar, or Nergal-sar-uzur, his brother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">In the year that he began to reign</span> - the year  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span> - <span class="cmt_word">did lift up the head of Jehoiachin King of Judah out of prison.</span> (For the phrase used, see <a href="../../par/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13, 19, 20</a>.) The act was probably part of a larger measure of pardon and amnesty, intended to inaugurate favorably the new reign. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-28.htm">2 Kings 25:28</a></div><div class="verse">And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake kindly to him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he spake good things with him</span>; but the meaning is well expressed by our rendering. Evil-Merodach compassionated the sufferings of the unfortunate monarch, who had grown old in prison, and strove by kind speech to make up to him for them in a certain measure. <span class="cmt_word">And set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</span> Evil-Merodach had at his court other captured kings besides Jehoiachin, whose presence was considered to enhance his dignity and grandeur (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>). An honorable position and probably a seat of honor was assigned to each; but the highest position among them was now conferred on Jehoiachin. Whether he had actually a more elevated seat, is (as Bahr observes) a mattes of no importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a></div><div class="verse">And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And changed his prison garments.</span> The subject to "changed" may be either "Jehoiachin" or" Evil-Merodach." Our translators preferred the latter, our Revisers the former. In either case the general meaning is the same. Evil Merodach supplied suitable garments to the released monarch instead of his "prison garments," and Jehoiachin arrayed himself in the comely apparel before taking his seat among his equals. Dresses of honor are among the most common gifts which an Oriental monarch makes to his subjects (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 5:1. &sect; 1). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin - <span class="cmt_word">did eat bread continually before him.</span> Besides giving occasional great feasts (see <a href="../../par/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-9</a>), Oriental monarchs usually entertain at their table daily a large number of guests, some of whom are specially invited, while others have the privilege of daily attendance (see ' Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 214, 215). It was to this latter class that Jehoiachin was admitted. Comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>, which shows that the custom was one not unknown at the Jewish court. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin's - <span class="cmt_word">life.</span> Jehoisohin enjoyed this privilege till his death. Whether this fell in the lifetime of Evil-Merodach or not, is scarcely in the writer's thoughts. He merely means to tell us that the comparative comfort and dignity which Jehoiachin enjoyed after the accession of Evil-Merodach to the throne was not subsequently clouded over or disturbed. He continued a privileged person at the Baby-Ionian court so long as he lived. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/25-30.htm">2 Kings 25:30</a></div><div class="verse">And his allowance <i>was</i> a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his allowance was a continual allowance.</span> Keil supposes that this "allowance" was a daily "ration of food," intended for the maintenance of a certain number of servants or retainers. But it is quite as likely to have been a money payment. The word translated by "allowance"  - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> - does not point necessarily to food. It is a "portion' of any kind. <span class="cmt_word">Given him of the king</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the privy purse, by the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">a daily rate for every day</span> - or, a c<span class="accented">ertain amount day by</span> day - <span class="cmt_word">all the days of his life</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse). Beth the privileges accorded to Jehoiachin, his sustenance at the king's table, and his allowance, whether in money or in kind, continued to the day of his death. Neither of them was ever revoked or forfeited. Thus this last representative of the Davidic monarchy, after thirty-six years of chastisement, experienced a happy change of circumstances, and died in peace and comfort. Probably, as Keil says, "this event was intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for their sins that they had been driven away from before his face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 24"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
