The fate of Judah was fixed (vers. 26, 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order.</span> Not the "deputy-high priests," of whom there seems to have been only one at this period of the history (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>); nor the "heads of the courses," who were not recognized as a distinct class of priests till much later; but merely the common priests, as distinguished from the high priest. (So Keil, Bahr, and others.) <span class="cmt_word">And the keepers of the door</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the keepers of the threshold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Levites, whose duty it was to keep watch and ward at the outer temple gates (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13-18</a>). Their importance at this time appears again in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal.</span> The reformation naturally began with the purging of the temple. So the reformation under Jehoiada (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>) and that of Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-15.htm">2 Chronicles 33:15</a>). Under "the vessels" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) would be included the entire paraphernalia of worship, even the two altars which had been set up in honor of Baal in the outer and the inner courts (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for the grove</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and for all the host of heaven.</span> The three worships are here united, because there was a close connection between them. Baal was, in one of his aspects, the sun; and Astarte, the goddess of the "grove" wet-ship, was, in one of her aspects, the moon. The cult of "the host of heaven," though, perhaps, derived from a different source, naturally became associated with the cults of the sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron.</span> The Law required that idols should be burnt with fire (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>), and likewise "groves" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). It was enough to "overthrow" altars (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>) and to "break" pillars. But Josiah seems to have thought it best to destroy by fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the completest possible way, all the objects, of whatever kind, which had been connected with the idol-worship (see vers. 6, 12, 15, 16). The burning took place in "the fields of Kidron," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the upper part of the Kidron valley, to the northeast of Jerusalem, in order that not even the smoke should pollute the town (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.</span> This was a very unusual precaution, and shows Josiah's extreme scrupulousness. He would not have even the ashes of the wooden objects, or the calcined powder of the metal ones, remain even in the vicinity of the holy city, but transported them to a distance. In selecting Bethel as the place to convey them to, he was no doubt actuated by the circumstance that that village was in some sense the fount and origin of all the religious impurities which had overflowed the land. That which had proceeded from Bethel might well be taken back thither.

Dollinger says ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. pp. 430, 431) of these wretched persons, "To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement, and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose. Thereupon they ran with the mutilated part through the city, and received from the houses which they threw them into, a woman's gear. Not chastity, but barrenness, was intended by the mutilation. In this the Galli only desired to be like their goddess. The relation of foul lust, which they thenceforward occupied towards women, was regarded as a holy thing, and was tolerated by husbands in their wives." <span class="cmt_word">That were by the house of the Lord.</span> The near vicinity is an indication that the Galli took part in the foreign rites introduced into the temple by Manasseh and Amon.

They employed themselves, among other occupations, in weaving "hangings" (literally, "houses," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "coverings") for the Asherah.

The origin of the name is uncertain; but it is most likely that the Beni-Hinnom were a tribe of Canaanites, settled on this side of Jerusalem in the time of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>). The "valley" is a ravine, deep and narrow, with steep, rocky sides. When the Moloch-worship first began in it we cannot say; but it was probably before the time of Solomon, who built a high place for Moloch (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11</a>), on one of the heights by which the valley is enclosed. (On the horrible profanations of the Moloch-worship, see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.) After the Captivity, the valley of Hinnom - Ge-Hinnom - was reckoned an accursed and abominable place, a sort of earthly counterpart of the place of final punishment, which. thence derived its name of "Geheuna" (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); (see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Moloch</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 16:3).

The sacrifice of the horse to the sun was more general (Herod., 1:216; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3. &sect; 24; 'Anab.,' 4:5. &sect; 35; Rig Veda, vol. 2. pp. 112, <span class="accented">et seqq</span>., etc.), but does not seem to have been adopted by the Hebrews.

Bones of men had also the actual taint of corruption about them. The "uncleanness" of dead bodies arose first out of man's natural shrinking from death, and was then further confirmed by the horrors accompanying decay. The notion was probably coeval with death itself. It received a sanction from the Law, which made it a legal defilement to touch a corpse (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 16</a>), and placed under a sentence of uncleanness all that was in the tent where a man died (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14, 15</a>).

At such a national center as Bethel a temple would, of course, accompany the altar. Whether the temple and altar were in use or not at the time when Josiah destroyed them, is uncertain.

By what right Josiah exercised sovereign authority in the old kingdom of Samaria, which the Assyrians had conquered and attached to their empire, can only be conjectured. Some have supposed that the Assyrians had enlarged his sovereignty, and placed Samaria under his rule; others regard him as having transferred his allegiance to Nabopolassar, and having been made by him viceroy over Palestine. But it is, perhaps, most probable that he merely took advantage of the political commotions of the time to extend his dominion so far as it seemed safe to do so. Asshur-bani-pal, the last energetic King of Assyria, appears to have ceased to reign in Josiah's fourteenth year, when he was succeeded by a weak monarch, Asshur-ebil-ili. Great troubles now broke out. The Scythians ravaged Western Asia far and wide. Assyria was attacked by the Medea and Babylonians in combination. Under these circumstances, Josiah found himself practically independent, and began to entertain ambitious projects. He "extended his dominion from Jerusalem over Samaria" (Ewald). Assyria was too much occupied to take any notice. Baby-Ionia was in the thick of the struggle. Josiah found himself able to reunite under his own headship all the scattered portions of the old Israelite kingdom, except, perhaps, the trans-Jordanic district. He levied taxes in Samaria as freely as in Judaea (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-9.htm">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>). He reformed on the same model the religions of both countries. When finally he had to fight for his throne, he marched his army into the northern portion of Samaria, and there fought the battle which cost him his life. <span class="cmt_word">Which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger.</span> The earlier kings of Israel had simply allowed the "high places" to continue, without actively increasing or multiplying them; but Manasseh had re-established them after their destruction by Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), and Amen had probably done the same after Manasseh's tardy reformation. <span class="cmt_word">Jonah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he done in Bethel</span> (see above, ver. 15).

It is an extraordinary perversity which concludes (as do De Wette and Thenius), from this comparison of the present with former Passovers under the judges and the kings, that there had been no such former Passovers at all!

Ewald has the good sense to express his dissent from this view, and to declare the meaning of the writer to be simply that "since the time of the judges there had never been such a celebration of the Passover, in such strict accordance, that is, with the prescriptions of a sacred book as that which now took place" (see his 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 239, Eng. trans.).

Thirty years of irreligion and idolatry under Manasseh had sapped the national vigor, and made true repentance an impossibility. How weak and half-hearted must have been the return to God towards the close of Manasseh's reign, that it should have had no strength to resist Amon, a youth of twenty-two, but should have disappeared wholly on his accession! And how far from sincere must have been the present conformity to the wishes of Josiah, the professed renewal of the covenant (ver. 3), and revival of disused ceremonies (vers. 21-23)! Jeremiah searched in vain through the streets of Jerusalem to find a man that executed judgment, or sought the truth (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>).

Politically, the time was a stirring one. The great invasion of Western Asia by the Scythic hordes (Herod., 1:103-106), which is alluded to by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38, 39</a>, and perhaps by <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>, probably belongs to it; as also the attack of Psamatik I. upon Philistia (Herod., 2:105), the fall of the Assyrian empire (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 617</span>), and the destruction of Nineveh: the establishment of the independence of Babylon, and her rise to greatness; together with the transfer of power in the central part of Western Asia, from the Assyrians to the Medea. Amid the dangers which beset him, Josiah appears to have conducted himself prudently, gradually extending his power over Samaria and Galilee, without coming into hostile collision with any of the neighboring nations, until about the year  <span class="date">B.C. 609</span> or 608, when his land was invaded by Pharaoh-Nechoh, the Neku of the Egyptian monuments. Josiah felt himself called upon to resist this invasion, and, in doing so, met his death (vers. 29, 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did.</span> Josiah was reckoned a good rather than a great king. No mention is made of his "might." The writer of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>) commemorates his "kindnesses" or "his good deeds." The son of Sirach speaks of his "upright" behavior (Ecclus. 49:2). Josephus ('Ant.

He was one of the most enterprising of the later Egyptian kings, and appears to have made this expedition in his second or third year. The unsettled condition of Western Asia after the Scythic invasion, and the fall of the Assyrian empire, seemed to give an opportunity for Egypt to reclaim her old dominion over Syria and Mesopotamia. The "King of Assyria," against whom Pharaoh-Nechoh "went up," was probably Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar. His proper rifle was "King of Babylon," which is what Nebuchadnezzar always calls him ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 113, line 22; vol. 7. p. 71, line 6; p. 75, line 9); but the Jews not unnaturally regarded him as the inheritor of the Assyrian empire, as indeed they regarded the Persian monarchs also (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>), and therefore gave him the title of "King of Assyria." <span class="cmt_word">To the river Euphrates.</span> The author of Chronicles says that "Necho King of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish" (or "at Carehemish") "by Euphrates," which shows that his design was to penetrate into Northern Syria, where Carchemish (now <span class="accented">Jerabus</span>) was situated, with a view probably of crossing the Euphrates by the ford at Bir, or by that at Balis, into Mesopotamia. <span class="cmt_word">And King Josiah wont against him.</span> It is possible that Josiah had accepted the position of Babylonian tributary after the fall of the Assyrian kingdom, and thought himself bound to resist an attack upon his suzerain. Or he may simply have resented the violation of his territory, without his permission, by a foreign army. Certainly, if he had allowed the free passage of the Egyptian troops, backwards and forwards, through his country, he would in a short time have lost even the shadow of independence. Nechoh's assurance that his expedition was not against him (Josiah), but against the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>), was not a thing to be relied upon, any more than his declaration that God had commanded his expedition. <span class="cmt_word">And he slew him at Megiddo, when he had soon him.</span> Megiddo is, beyond all doubt, the present <span class="accented">El-Ledjun</span> on the northern outskirt of the range of hills which separates the Plain of Esdraelon from that of Sharon. It is certainly surprising to find that Josiah had taken up a position so far to the north, leaving Jerusalem, and, indeed, all Judaea, unprotected. But he may have thought the advantages of the position such as to compensate for any risk to the Judaean cities, in which he would, of course, have left garrisons. Or, possibly, as Keil and Bahr suppose, Nechoh may have conveyed his troops to the Syrian coast by sea, and have landed in the Bay of Acre, close to the Plain of Esdraelon. In this case Josiah would have no choice, but, if he opposed the Egyptian monarch at all, must have met him where he did, in the Esdraelon plain, as he entered it from the Plain of Acre.

We learn from Chronicles that a great lamentation was made for Josiah, the only King of Judah slain in battle, the last good king of David's line, the pious prince whose piety had not sufficed to avert the anger of Jehovah. Jeremiah "lamented for him" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>), perhaps in a set composition (Josephus, ' Ant.

He was further mourned by "all the singing men and the singing women" (2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), who "spake of him in their lamentations, and "made them an ordinance in Israel," and entered these "lamentations," apparently in a book, which was called 'The Book of Lamentations,' or 'of Dirges.' <span class="cmt_word">And the people of the laud took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah.</span> Jehoahaz was otherwise named "Shallum" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>).

Pharaoh-Nechoh, having defeated Josiah, left Jerusalem and Judaea behind him, while he pressed forward on his original enterprise (see ver. 29) into Northern Syria and the district about Carehemish, or the tract north-east of Aleppo. It was three months before he had completed his conquests in these quarters, and, having arranged matters to his satisfaction, set out on his return to Egypt. During these three months Jehoahaz bore rule at Jerusalem (ver. 31), and "did evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 32). Ezekiel compares him to "a young lion," which "learned to catch the prey, and devoured men" (Ezekiel 19:3). It may be suspected that he re-established the idolatries which Josiah had put down; but this is uncertain. Pharaoh-Nechoh, on his return from Carehemish, learning what the Jews had done, sent envoys to Jerusalem, and summoned Jehoahaz to his presence at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath (ver. 33; comp. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). Je-hoahaz obeyed the summons; and Nechoh, having obtained possession of his person, "put him in bands," and carried him off to Egypt, where he died (ver. 34; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>; Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign.</span> He was, therefore, younger than his brother Eliakim, who, three months later, was "twenty-five years old" (ver. 36).

Hamath, to which it was regarded as belonging, is situated more than fifty miles further down the river. Riblah was well placed as a center for communication with the neighboring countries. As Dr. Robinson says ('Researches,' vol. 3. p. 545), "From this point the roads were open by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Nineveh, or by Palmyra (Tadmor) to Babylon, by the end of Lebanon and the coast to Palestine (Philistia) and Egypt, or through the, Buka'a and the Jordan valley to the center of the Holy Land."

Pharaoh-Nechoh, when he deposed Jehoahaz, at once supplied his place by another king.

His choice fell on Josiah's eldest surviving son (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>), Eliakim, who was the natural successor of his father. Eliakim, on ascending the throne, changed his name, as Jehoahaz appears to have done (see the comment on ver. 31), and reigned as Jehoiakim. For three years (B.C. 608-605) he continued a submissive vassal of the Egyptian monarch, and remitted him his tribute regularly (ver. 36). But his rule was in all respects an evil one. He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 37).

Jud.' 10:5. &sect; 2); he "shed innocent blood" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>); he was luxurious (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14, 15</a>), covetous (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), and tyrannical (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-6.htm">Ezekiel 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father.</span> (On the general inclination of Oriental monarchs to support the hereditary principle, and to establish sons in their fathers' governments, even when the father's had been rebels or enemies, see Herod., 3:15.) <span class="cmt_word">And turned his name to Jehoiakim.</span> We may understand that Nechoh required him to take a new name, as a mark of subjection (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>; and also <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), but left the choice of the name to himself. He made the change as slight as possible, merely substituting "Jehovah" for "El" as the initial element. The sense of the name remained the same, "God will set up." The idea that Nechoh was pleased with the new name on account of its apparent connection with the Egyptian moon-god, Aah (Menzel), is very fanciful. <span class="cmt_word">And took Jehoahaz away</span>  <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> carried him captive to Egypt (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-4.htm">Ezekiel 19:4</a>), a very common practice of Egyptian conquerors, and one often accompanied by extreme severities - <span class="cmt_word">and he cams to Egypt, and died there</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>, where this is prophesied).

Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>). Josephus calls him "an unjust man and an evil-doer, neither pious in his relations towards God nor equitable in his dealings with his fellow men" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). His execution of Urijah, the son of Shemalah, for prophesying the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>), was an act at once of cruelty and impiety. It is suspected (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 252) that, besides reintroducing into Judah all the foreign rites extirpated by his father, he added Egyptian rites to their number. The tyranny which he practiced was likewise of an Egyptian cast, including, as it did, the exaction of forced labor from his subjects (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), an old custom of the Pharaohs, and it is quite possible that his "passion for building splendid and costly houses" (Ewald) was awakened by his knowledge of the magnificence which characterized the monarchs of the Saitic dynasty, who revived in Egypt the architectural glories of the Ramessides (see Herod., 2:153, 175, 176). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
