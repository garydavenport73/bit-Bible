The "Moabite Stone," discovered in 1869, throws considerable light on the character and circumstances of this rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">Moab</span> had, we know, been subjected by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), and had been very severely treated. Either in the reign of Solomon, or more probably at his death, and the disruption of his kingdom, the Moabites had revolted, and resumed an independent position, which they had maintained until the reign of Omri. Omri, who was a warlike monarch, the greatest of the Israelite monarchs after Jeroboam, after settling himself firmly upon the throne of Israel, attacked the Moabite territory, and in a short time reduced it, making the native king, Chemosh-gad, his tributary. At the death of Omri, Ahab succeeded to the suzerainty, and maintained it during his lifetime, exacting a tribute that was felt as a severe "oppression" (Moabite Stone, line 6; comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The death of Ahab in battle and the defeat of his army encouraged Mesha, who had succeeded his father, Chemosh-gad, to raise the standard of revolt once more, and to emancipate his country after a period of subjection which he estimates roughly at "forty years."  The "Stone" is chiefly occupied with an account of the steps by which he recovered his territory. <span class="cmt_word">After the death of Ahab.</span> Probably, as soon as he heard of it. In Oriental empires the death of a brave and energetic monarch is constantly the signal for a general revolt of the subject peoples. They entertain a hope that his successor will not inherit his vigor and capacity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that <i>was</i> in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahaziah fell down through a lattice</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through the lattice</span>. It is implied that the <span class="cmt_word">upper chamber</span> had a single window, which was closed by a single <span class="accented">lattice</span>, or shutter of interlaced woodwork. The shutter may have been insufficiently secured; or the woodwork may have been too weak to bear his weight, Compare the fall of Eutychus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), where, however, there is no mention of a "lattice." <span class="cmt_word">Was sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "was so injured that he had to take to his bed." <span class="cmt_word">Inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron.</span> As a worshipper of Baal, bent on walking in the evil way of his father and of his mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>), Ahaziah would naturally inquire of some form of the Baal divinity. Why he chose "Baal-zebub the god of Ekron," it is impossible to say. Perhaps Baal-zebub had at the time a special reputation for giving oracular responses. Perhaps the Ekron temple was, of all the ancient sites of the Baal-worship, the one with which he could most readily communicate. Philistia lay nearer to Samaria than Phoenicia did, and of the Philistine towns Ekron (now <span class="accented">Akir</span>) was the most northern, and so the nearest. "Baal-zebub" has been thought by some to be equivalent to "Beel-samen," "the lord of heaven" - a divine title well known to the Phoenicians; but this view is etymologically unsound, since <span class="accented">zebub</span> cannot possibly mean "heaven." "Baal-zebub" is "the lord of flies " - either the god who sends them as a plague on any nation that offends him (setup. <a href="../../par/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-31</a>), or the god who averts them from his votaries and favorites, an equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or the Roman "Jupiter Myiagrus," flies being in the East not infrequently a terrible plague. The Septuagint translation, <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, though inaccurate, shows an appreciation of the true etymology. <span class="cmt_word">Of this disease</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of this illness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-3.htm">2 Kings 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, <i>Is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> not a God in Israel, <i>that</i> ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord</span>. It would be better to translate, with the LXX., <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). An angel had appeared to Elijah on a previous occasion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Elijah the Tishbite</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-17.htm">1 Kings 21:17, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>; and for the meaning of the expression, <span class="accented">hat-Tishbi</span>, see the comment on 1 Kings 17:1). <span class="cmt_word">Arise, go up.</span> Elijah was, apparently, in the low tract of the Shefelah, or in Sharon, when the messengers started, and was thus commanded to go up and meet them, or intercept them on their journey before they descended into the plain. God would not have the insult to his majesty, carried out. <span class="cmt_word">Is it not because there is not a God in Israel?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is it that there is no God at all in Israel</span>? The double negative is intensitive, and implies that the king's consultation of Baal-zebub, god of Ekron, is a complete and absolute denial of the Divinity of Jehovah. To consult a foreign oracle is equivalent to raying that the voice of God is wholly silent in one's own land. This was going further in apostasy than Ahab had gone (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6-9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-4.htm">2 Kings 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

It is implied that he might have recovered if he had acted otherwise. <span class="cmt_word">And Elijah departed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quitted the messengers, showing that his errand was accomplished - he had said all that he was commissioned to say.

He therefore inquired of them, <span class="cmt_word">Why are ye now turned back?</span> "Why have ye not completed your journey?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-6.htm">2 Kings 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, <i>Is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> not a God in Israel, <i>that</i> thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came a man.</span> It is not likely that the messengers did not know Elijah by sight. He was too prominent a person in the history of the time, and too remarkable in his appearance, not to have been recognized, at any rate by some of them. But they thought it best to keep back the prophet's name, and to call him simply "a man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>) - perhaps actuated by good will towards Elijah, perhaps by a fear for their own safety, such as had been felt by Obadiah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-7.htm">2 Kings 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto them, What manner of man <i>was he</i> which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What manner of man was he?</span> literally, <span class="accented">what was the manner of the man</span>? What was his appearance? Were there any marks about him by which he might be recognized and known? Ahaziah may have already suspected that the man who had denounced woe on him would be the same who had denounced woe on his father (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20-22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And they answered him, <i>He was</i> an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It <i>is</i> Elijah the Tishbite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A hairy man</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">lord</span> <span class="accented">of hair</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). Some take the meaning to be that he was rough and unkempt, with his hair and beard long; and so the LXX., who give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. But the more usual explanation is that he wore a shaggy coat of untanned skin, with the hair outward. Such a garment seems certainly to have been worn by the later prophets (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and to have been regarded as a sign of their profession. But there is no positive evidence that the dress had been adopted by Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span> Generally the Israelites wore girdles of a soft material, as linen or cotton. The "curious girdle" of the high priest's ephod was of "fine twined linen," embroidered with gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). Girdles of leather, rough and uncomfortable, would only be worn by the very poor and by the ascetic. Elijah may have adopted his rough and coarse costume, either to show contempt for things earthly, as Hengstenberg thinks; or as a penitential garb indicating sorrow for the sins of the people, as Keil supposes; or simple to chastise and subdue the flesh, as other ascetics. <span class="cmt_word">It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The description given is enough. The king has no longer any doubt. His suspicion is turned into certainty. There is no living person but Elijah who would at once have the boldness to prophesy the death of the king, and would wear such a costume as described. Elijah is, of course, his enemy, as he had been his father's "enemy" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), and will wish him ill, and prophesy accordingly, the wish being "father to the thought." It is not improbable that Elijah had withdrawn himself into obscurity on the accession of Ahaziah, or at any rate on his exhibition of strong idolatrous proclivities (Ewald), as he had done on more than one occasion from Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-8</a>). Ahaziah may have been long wishing to arrest and imprison him, and now thought he saw his opportunity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king sent unto him a captain of fifty.</span> "Captains of fifties" were first instituted in the wilderness by the advice of Jethro (<a href="../../par/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-25</a>). Though not expressly mentioned in the military organization of David, they probably formed a part of it, and so passed into the institutions of the kingdom of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">With his fifty.</span> Some recognition of Elijah's superhuman power would seem to have led Ahaziah to send so large a body. His doing so was a sort of challenge to the prophet to show whether Ahaziah or the God whom he represented was the stronger. The circumstances recall those of the "band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees" (<a href="../../par/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>), which was sent, "with swords and staves," to arrest another righteous Person. <span class="cmt_word">He sat on the top of a hill</span>; literally, on <span class="accented">the top of the hill</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). The high ground where Elijah had met the messengers (ver. 3) seems to be intended. When they were gone, the prophet took his seat on the highest point, conspicuous on all sides, so avoiding any attempt at concealment, and awaiting the next step that the king would take, calmly and quietly. <span class="cmt_word">He spake unto him; Thou man of God.</span> The captain is thought by some to have spoken ironically; but there is no evidence of this. The address is respectful, submissive. The miraculous powers of Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) were probably known to the officer, who hoped by the tone of his address to escape the prophet's anger. In the same spirit he avoids issuing any command of his own, and prefers simply to deliver the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath said, Come down.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I <i>be</i> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elijah answered... let fire come down.</span> The LXX. render, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> - "fire will come down;" and so some moderns, who are anxious to clear the prophet of the charges of cruelty and bloodthirstiness which have been brought against him. But there is no need of altering the translation, Elijah undoubtedly "commanded fire to come down from heaven" (<a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>), or, in other words, prayed to God that it might come down, and in answer to his prayer the fire fell. The narrative may be set aside as an embellishment of later times, having no historical foundation, by those who (like Ewald) deny that miracles are possible; but, if it be accepted, it must be accepted as it stands, and Elijah must be regarded, not as having merely prophesied a result, but as having been instrumental in producing it. We must judge Elijah, not by the ideas of our own day, but by those of the age wherein he lived. He was raised up to vindicate God's honor, to check and punish idolatry, to keep alive a faithful remnant in Israel, when all the powers of the earth were leagued together to destroy and smother true religion. He was an embodiment of the Law - of absolute, strict, severe justice. The fair face of mercy was not revealed to him. Already, at Carmel, he had executed the Divine vengeance on idolaters after an exemplary fashion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). Now, Ahaziah, the son of the wicked Jezebel, had challenged Jehovah to a trial of strength by first ignoring him, and then sending a troop of soldiers to arrest his prophet. Was Elijah to succumb without an effort, or was he to vindicate the majesty and honor of Jehovah? He had no power of himself to do either good or harm. He could but pray to Jehovah, and Jehovah, in his wisdom and perfect goodness, would either grant or refuse his prayer. If he granted it, the punishment inflicted would not be Elijah's work, but his. To tax Elijah with cruelty is to involve God in the charge. God regarded it as a fitting time for making a signal example, and, so regarding it, he inspired a spirit of indignation in the breast of his prophet, who thereupon made the prayer which he saw fit to answer. The judgment was in accordance with the general tone and tenor of the Law, which assigns "tribulation and anguish to every soul of man that doeth evil" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>), and visits with death every act of rebellion against God. <span class="cmt_word">There came down fire.</span> Josephus says that the "fire" was a flash of lightning (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), and so the commentators generally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.

The fate of the two former captains had become known to him by some means or other, and this induced him to assume an attitude, not of command, but of submission. He acknowledged that the prophet held his life and the lives of his fifty men at his free disposal, and begged that they might <span class="cmt_word">be precious in his sight,</span> or, in other words, that he would spare them.

Thus saith the Lord, <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word! Therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span> God's determinations are unalterable.

The apparent discrepancy is reconciled by supposing that Jehoshaphat associated his son Jehoram in the kingdom in his seventeenth year, when he was about to enter upon the Syrian war, so that the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat was also the second year of Jehoram. It is certain that association was largely practiced in Egypt at a date long anterior to Jehoshaphat, and David's proclamation of Solomon as king was an association, so that the explanation is not untenable. On the other hand, the difficulties of the chronology of 2 Kings are so numerous and so great as to defy complete reconciliation, and to lead to a suspicion that the numbers have either suffered extensive corruption, or have been manipulated by an unskillful reviser (see Introduction, p. 3.). <span class="cmt_word">Because he had no son</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. because</span> he, Ahaziah, had no son, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Jehoram.

Mesha's war of independence consisted of a succession of sieges, whereby he recovered one by one the various strongholds in his territory, which were occupied by the Israelites - Medeba, Ataroth, Nebo, Jahaz, Horonaim, and others  - expelling the foreign garrisons, rebuilding or strengthening the fortifications, and occupying the cities by garrisons of his own. On one occasion, at the siege of Nebo, he declares that he killed seven thousand men. He found in the town a place of worship containing vessels, which he regarded as "vessels of Jehovah" (Moabite Stone, line 18); these he took? and dedicated them to Chemosh, the special god of Moab. How much of the war fell into the reign of Ahaziah, and how much into that of Jehoram his brother, is uncertain. Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the tines of Israel? Mesha's stone is a striking testimony to the <span class="accented">contemporary</span> record of historical events by the Palestinian monarchs of the time, which has sometimes been doubted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_kings/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Kings 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
