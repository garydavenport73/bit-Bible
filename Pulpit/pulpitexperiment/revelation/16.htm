<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <i>upon</i> them which worshipped his image.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;</span> <span class="accented">his bowl into</span>, etc. (Revised Version). (On "vial," see on Revelation 5:8.) The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "into," distinguishes the first three vials from the last four, which have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," and some writers make this the basis for classifying the vials into groups of three and four; but it seems better to divide into groups of four and three (see on ver. 1, and preliminary remarks on the trumpet visions). And there fell; <span class="accented">and it became</span> (Revised Version). Compare the phraseology of <a href="../../par/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>. A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. The counterpart of the sixth plague of Egypt. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "sore," used here, is the same used in LXX., <a href="../../par/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>. It is impossible to say with certainty what (if any) particular judgment upon the ungodly is intended to be signified by St. John in this plague. From amongst the numerous interpretations which have been given to illustrate this passage, we may mention that of Andreas, who sees in it a reference to the "ulcer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of conscience. Or it may be that the writer has in contemplation that bodily disease which is the inevitable outcome of sin, and which often afflicts men in this world as the direct result of their misdoings; though, of course, it cannot always be asserted to be a consequence of a man's own personal misdoings. (On the latter part of the verse, see on Revelation 13.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <i>man</i>: and every living soul died in the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea.</span> Omit "angel," which is not found in the best manuscripts, though it is understood.

The <span class="accented">sea</span> is also the object of the second trumpet plague (see on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And it became as the blood of a dead man;</span> <span class="accented">became blood as of a dead man.</span> Almost an exact reproduction of the second trumpet, and of the first of the Egyptian plagues. The last clause intensifies the horrible nature of the judgment, and thus in some degree increases the severity of this plague over that of the trumpets. <span class="cmt_word">And every living soul died in the sea;</span> <span class="accented">and every soul of life died</span>, [<span class="accented">even</span>] <span class="accented">the things in the sea</span>, though <span class="accented">living soul</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, some cursives, versions, and Fathers. Not merely human lives. The <span class="accented">things</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, and others. In <a href="../../par/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a> we have, "Even the creatures that were in the sea." The interpretations are as numerous as in the case of the second trumpet (see on Revelation 8:9). It is most probable that the sea is here mentioned as part of creation (another part of which is mentioned in the following verse), the whole of which suffers for the sin of man, and the whole of which, intended for his benefit, becomes a source of affliction and woe to him through sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-4.htm">Revelation 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood</span>. Omit "angel" (see on ver. 3). "Into the rivers," etc., as in the previous cases. The singular <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, probably on account of the neuter <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fde;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being understood. The idea of the second vial is carried on here (cf. on ver. 3). Note the corresponding judgment of the third trumpet. In addition to the interpretation of the second vial given above, it is probable that the blood signifies the slaughter and death which is part of God's vengeance on the wicked (cf. ver. 6). The divisions adopted in the first four vials correspond to those in <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, which designate the whole of God's created world, "heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the angel of the waters say.</span> The angels, throughout this book, are represented as having individual offices to fulfil. Here we have a reference to the angel whose duty it is to control the rivers, just as, in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, another angel is represented as having authority over fire. This verse and the following one are anticipations of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, which is a commentary on <a href="../../par/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which latter is an elaboration of the judgments here described. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus;</span> <span class="accented">righteous art thou, which art and which wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge</span> (Revised Version). There is scarcely any authority for inserting "O Lord," or "and shalt be" (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). The angel, as having authority over the waters, and, as it were, a commission to see that they do their duty for men, acknowledges the justice of the sentence which makes them into an instrument for, and type of, man's destruction. Though there is no authority for inserting "and shalt be," the idea is, no doubt, to express the eternal nature of God. The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a> (Revised Version) in almost exactly parallel connection; so also in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17, 18</a>. <span class="accented">Thou hast judged thus</span> refers to the judgment of the third vial, possibly to all the first three, Note the marginal reading of the Revised Version (supported by Alford), which disconnects this verse from the succeeding one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</span> This supplies the key to the interpretation of the previous visions. The ungodly have shed the blood of saints, therefore God deals out death to them. This is the meaning signified by the "blood" of the previous verses (cf. the doom of Babylon, described in <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, especially ver. 6; and <a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6, 24</a>. Cf. the words, "they are worthy," with <a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). It is correct to consider that this prophecy received its first fulfilment in the violent deaths of so many of those who were the earliest Christian persecutors. On this subject see Lactantius, 'De Morte Persecutorum.' 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-7.htm">Revelation 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i>are</i> thy judgments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And! heard another out of the altar say.</span> Omit "another out of." The <span class="accented">altar</span> is connected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with the martyred saints (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the judgments that fall on the earth in vengeance for the blood of the saints (<a href="../../par/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>); hence the appropriateness of this voice from the altar, which acquiesces in the judgments inflicted. The altar is here personified, and speaks concurring in the justice of those judgments sent on account of the saints who are represented by it. Some writers, however, understand "the angel of the altar," which is similar to the reading of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments;</span> <span class="accented">Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty</span> (Revised Version). Reaffirming what has been declared by the angel of the waters (ver. 5), and expressing concurrence therein. (On "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>), see on Revelation 3:17.) Compare the expression in ver. 5. There God is declared <span class="accented">righteous</span> because he has thus judged; here the judgments are <span class="accented">righteous</span> because they. are his. Both phrases are equally true, giving the same truth from different standpoints. The same verdict is endorsed by the heavenly multitude in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, when they celebrate the downfall of Babylon; another proof of the identity of the world which is here the object of the vial judgments and the Babylon, which is afterwards described, and whose doom is pronounced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "angel," is omitted in nearly all manuscripts, though, of course, it is understood. For the first time we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. "into" (see on ver. 2). Another part of creation is visited, thus completing the visitation of the fourfold division of the universe - the earth, the sea, the rivers, the heavens - as foretold in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto him to scorch men with fire</span>. "And it was given to it" is more probable than "to him;" the angels do not directly punish, but indirectly by pouring out the vials. This form of words expresses the permissory nature of the evil which is wrought; nothing can be done but by the will of God (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5, 7, 14</a>). Bengel, Hengstenberg, and others consider that the permission to scorch men is given to the angel. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">men</span> (with the article); perhaps referring to those mentioned in ver. 2. who had the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image, and who are the object of all the vial plagues. Though differing in form from the fourth trumpet, where the sun was darkened, yet the judgment is similar, though here of a more intense nature. In both cases, those objects which are given to men for their good are converted into instruments of punishment. We may, perhaps, see here an allusion to the heat of men's passions and vices, by which physically as well as morally they are destroyed; and which are also an emblem of the pains of hell as pictured in <a href="../../par/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>. It has been noticed as a coincidence that the objects of creation which are the subjects of the judgments of the fourth trumpet and fourth vial, were created on the fourth day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the Name of God.</span> <span class="accented">The men</span> (see on ver. 8). (On the meaning of the first clause, see on ver. 8.) This is the first mention in the vials of men blaspheming. As with Pharaoh and the Egyptians, the judgments of God, instead of awakening them to repentance, only serve to harden their hearts. This again occurs under the fifth and seventh vials. So also in the sixth trumpet, we are told, men repented not - a statement also made in the subsequent part of this verse. As before pointed out (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), the two things are identical; non repentance, continuance in the service of the dragon, is blasphemy against God; though we generally reserve the name "blasphemy" for the open avowal of infidelity to God. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath power over these plagues.</span> This is what is implied in the words of ver. 8, "it was given to it?' In this visitation men distinctly recognize the hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">And they repented not to give him glory.</span> <span class="accented">Vide supra</span>, on the "blasphemy;" and contrast with <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>  - another example of the sense in which these vials are the "last plagues" (<a href="../../par/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast.</span> Omit "angel" as before (see on ver. 8). <span class="accented">The throne of the beast.</span> That throne which had been given to him by the dragon (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>), and which here typifies the centre and source of his power. While this <span class="accented">throne</span> may aptly refer to the Roman empire in St. John's time, its position varies at different times; wherever the world power is worshipped, there the beast has his throne. <span class="cmt_word">And his kingdom was full of darkness;</span> <span class="accented">was darkened.</span> Another allusion to the plagues of Egypt. The darkness is a type of the spiritual darkness which prevails among the subjects of the beast, and which they themselves frequently realize in the course of their career. The fear of the future sometimes arouses their misgivings, and then there is no light or hope in their hearts. And they gnawed their tongues for rain. The pain arising from the darkness of their minds; the misgivings as to their future (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); or perhaps also on account of their sufferings under the former plagues, to which this is an addition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores.</span> The expression, "God of heaven," seems to enhance the exaltation of God, and to place in more terrible contrast the sin of those who ventured to blaspheme One so high, so far above them. This title is only mentioned here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>, where, however, some repented. (On the word "blaspheme," see on ver. 9.) In spite, therefore, of their plagues, and perhaps as a consequence of their spiritual darkness, they still own the supremacy of the beast and deny God; just as Pharaoh hardened his heart. Compare the previous verses for an account of their <span class="accented">pains and their sores</span>; the allusion to which shows plainly that these plagues are not necessarily consecutive in time. <span class="cmt_word">And repented not of their deeds</span> (see on ver. 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river:Euphrates.</span> Omit "angel" (see on previous verses). (On the <span class="accented">Euphrates</span>, see on Revelation 9:14.) This river also figures in the sixth trumpet vision, and possesses the same signification in both places. It is the natural direction from which enemies arise; and it derives this signification from the fact that the enemies of the Jews often came from that direction. The next sentence leaves no doubt that this is the meaning, and supports the view taken of <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>. It is to be noticed that, though the vial is poured out upon the Euphrates, it is not with the purpose of inflicting injury on the river, but upon the men who are thus laid open to the attacks of their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">And the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</span> The Revised Version gives the sense more plainly, <span class="accented">That the way might be made ready for the kings that</span> [<span class="accented">come</span>] <span class="accented">from the sunrising.</span> The meaning is that a barrier that wards off hostile hosts is removed. The "kings of the cast" represent God's judgments; those who are laid open to attack are the adherents of the beast. The imagery may be derived: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> From the fact (as explained in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>, which see) that the enemies of the Jews generally came from beyond the Euphrates. This accounts for the employment of this figure in <a href="../../par/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a>, and may reasonably be considered to contain the same allusion here. In this case the minor details do not agree; the idea is merely to convey the central fact of an advance of enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> From the historical fact of the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, by means of a diversion of the waters of the Euphrates - a circumstance referred to in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31, 32</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27, 28</a>. In this case the details are more in accordance with the general symbolism of the Apocalypse. Babylon would signify the kingdom of the beast (as in ver. 19). The <span class="accented">kings of the east</span> would still represent God's judgments, which now assail the kingdom of Satan. Satan attempts to meet this assault by the three spirits, which gather kings from the whole world (ver. 14) to battle against the Almighty. The "kings of the east" are certainly the forces ranged on the side of God. Many writers see an allusion to Christ and the saints. The sun is a frequent figure of Christ in Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/malachi/4-4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and Zechariah 6:12, LXX.; <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; also <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>). "The kings of the east" may thus be identified with the armies of <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i>come</i> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw;</span> introduces a new phase of the vision (see on Revelation 4:1). The mention of the punishment of the ungodly by the kings of the east causes the seer to look forward to the conflict, the end of which is described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>. He therefore now digresses somewhat, in order to describe the means by which the dragon endeavours to enlist the hosts of the world on his side. <span class="cmt_word">Three unclean spirits like frogs.</span> These <span class="accented">three spirits</span> represent the influences of the dragon, the first beast and the second beast, which we have interpreted as the devil, the love of the world and worldly power, and self deceit; in other words, the devil, the world, the flesh. These influences axe spiritually <span class="accented">unclean</span>, and suggest the loathsome Egyptian plague of the <span class="accented">frogs</span>; that is to say, their likeness to frogs consists in their common quality of uncleanness. Perhaps also there is a reference to their devilish origin, in which they resembled the <span class="accented">unclean</span> spirits so frequently east out by our Lord while on earth. Burger very aptly refers to the contrast afforded by the dove-like form of the Holy Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</span> Omit "come." The seer does not behold the three spirits proceeding from the mouths of the evil trinity, but he sees those that are out of their mouths; he sees them in their works exhibited in the world. The second beast is here called the "false prophet," since he deludes men, and persuades them against their better judgment to worship the first beast (see on Revelation 13:11).

In the plague of the frogs, the Egyptian magicians imitated the plague of Moses; the second beast (the false prophet) is represented as leading men astray by his miracles (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>). After the sixth trumpet came the digression, in which an account was given of the two witnesses of God, who worked miracles (<a href="../../par/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.); here, after the sixth vial, we have a short digression, in which an account is given of the three witnesses of Satan, who endeavour rework on his behalf, by exhibiting miracles. (For the meaning of this working of miracles, see on Revelation 13:13.) <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world;</span> <span class="accented">the kings of the whole world -</span> omitting "of the earth" (Revised Version). <span class="accented">The kings of the world</span> are those whose aim and delight is the possession of the pleasures of this world; those who have their treasure in this world, and whose hearts are therefore also there; those who exercise their influence and power in regard only to the things of this world; in short, the worldly. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty;</span> <span class="accented">God, the Almighty.</span> This battle is described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, which see. <span class="accented">The great day</span> is the last great judgment day. The battle referred to here, and described in <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, and again in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-10</a>, is apparently the battle which is being waged against God by the forces of evil all through the history of the world, from the fall of Adam until the last judgment day. This seems certain from the description given in <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. and 20. How, then, can it be described as the "battle of the great day"? Probably because on that day will occur the crisis, as it were, of the conflict; on that day will the issue be plainly determined, and the struggle terminated. Though the battle is proceeding daily, there is little to remind us of it; the very existence of, and necessity for, such warfare is sometimes forgotten in the daily round of life: at the last day will be plainly exhibited the nature of the incessant hostility between God and the devil, and the power of the latter will be manifested only to be visibly shattered and finally destroyed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is</i> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I come as a thief.</span> The very words addressed to the Church at Sardis (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>), and similar to those connected by our blessed Lord with the great day (see ver. 14). The mention of that day, and perhaps the knowledge that the battle is a daily one (see on ver. 14), naturally leads to the solemn warning given here. It is worth notice how St. John adopts this idea; and this of itself should suffice to demonstrate the incorrectness of endeavoring to compute the times and seasons, as has been done by so many Apocalyptic writers (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</span> The same figure again as in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>. Isaac Williams correctly points out that these words seem to indicate that the battle of ver. 14 is a daily one, in which Christians are themselves engaged (see on ver. 14). The garment is the garment of righteousness, the fervent love of God (see on Revelation 3:17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they gathered</span>; that is, the "spirits" of ver. 14, of which this is a continuation, the same verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> being repeated. By the employment of the Hebrew term, attention is called to the symbolical nature of the name. Similar cases occur in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a> and elsewhere in St. John's writings (see on Revelation 9:11). The correct reading, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Har-Magedon</span>, signifies "Mountain of Megiddo;" the Authorized Version, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Armageddon</span>, "City of Megiddo." <span class="accented">Mount Megiddo</span> possibly refers to Carmel, at the foot of which lay the Plain of Megiddo, which was well known to every Jew as a gathering place for hostile hosts and as the scene of many battles. It is referred to in <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a> as a type of woe, on account of the overthrow and death of Josiah having taken place there (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). Ahaziah also died there (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>); and there also the Canaanitish kings were overthrown (<a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). The name is, therefore, indicative of battle and slaughter, and intimates the complete overthrow in store for the dragon and the kings of the earth, which is described later on (<a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air.</span> Omit "angel" as before. <span class="accented">Upon the air</span>; perhaps as the typical abode of the spirits of evil (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, "the prince of the power of the air"); the seat also, so to speak, of the thunders and lightnings which follow. <span class="cmt_word">And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</span> There are slight variations in the text here. The best authorities omit "of heaven." One manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, instead of "throne" inserts <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "of God." (On the characteristic <span class="accented">great voice</span>, see on Revelation 6:1, etc.) The same voice as in ver. 1, probably that of God himself, as the words, "from the throne," seem also to show. It is noticeable that here, as in the seal visions and trumpet visions, we are not explicitly informed of the nature of the last vision. We have the accompanying circumstances described in ver. 18, which are always attendant on the last great manifestation, but the end itself is left unrecorded. In the seals, the last vision is described by the silence in heaven; in the trumpets, the nature of the last judgment is only vaguely alluded to in the triumphant heavenly song. So here, only a brief summary is given (vers. 18, 19) of what actually falls as the last extremity of God's wrath; a fuller account is reserved for <a href="../../par/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a></div><div class="verse">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and</i> so great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great</span>. The usual accompaniments of any special manifestation of God's power or presence (see on Revelation 4:5 and Revelation 6:12-17). A similar description is given of the close of the seal and the trumpet visions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great city.</span> The words which follow, as well as <a href="../../par/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10, 16</a>, etc., leave scarcely any doubt that the "great city" here is Babylon. These are the only passages in the Apocalypse where this title is found; for in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, "great" is not the true reading. <span class="cmt_word">Was divided into three parts.</span> The signification of this clause is somewhat uncertain. The idea is probably that of total destruction, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, where a similar description is applied to Jerusalem. Possibly there is a reference to the trinity of evil mentioned in ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">And the cities of the nations fell.</span> <span class="accented">The nations</span> signifies the ungodly, who stand in the same relation to the godly as the Gentiles to God's chosen people (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>, etc.). This sentence declares the fall of every lesser form of evil, together with the greater typical form symbolized by" the great city." <span class="cmt_word">And great Babylon came in remembrance before God;</span> <span class="accented">and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God</span> (Revised Ver-tion). Cf. the title of "great city" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Cf. also the similar expression in <a href="../../par/acts/10-31.htm">Acts 10:31</a>. This clause, together with the following one, taken in conjunction with the preceding and succeeding verses, must be referred to the great judgment day. <span class="cmt_word">To give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</span> This is the beginning of the fulfilment of the doom predicted by the angel in <a href="../../par/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>.

Such convulsions of nature generally, in biblical descriptions, accompany the near approach of the last judgment. Some writers interpret the islands and mountains of kingdoms (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9, 10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i>every stone</i> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent</span>; <span class="accented">cometh down upon</span>, the present tense, rendering the description more graphic. Commentators usually quote 'Diodorus Siculus' (19:45), who mentions. as something marvellous, hailstones of a mina in weight; the mina being one-sixtieth of a talent; and also the account of Josephus, who speaks of stones a talent in weight being thrown by machines at the siege of Jerusalem (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>). "The men," though not pointing to any particular group of men who have been definitely mentioned, nevertheless necessarily refers to the wicked, were are the object of this punishment. "Hail" is frequently mentioned as a judgment of God and is added here to heighten the general effect of the description (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>; also <a href="../../par/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great;</span> <span class="accented">is exceeding great</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>).
