The king felt that his best hope, so far as man was concerned, lay in the prophetical order. Isaiah, Hosed, Joel, Micah, and perhaps Obadiah, were the prophets of the time; but it is not clear that any of them were accessible except Isaiah. He had been Ahaz's counselor (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>), and was now certainly among the regular counselors of Hezekiah. Moreover, he was in Jerusalem, and could readily be consulted. Hezekiah, therefore, sends to him in his distress, and sends a most honorable and dignified embassy. It is his intention to treat the prophet with the utmost respect and courtesy. No doubt, at this period the prophetical order stood higher than the priestly one in general estimation; and not unworthily. If any living man could give the king sound advice under the circumstances, it was the son of Amoz. <span class="cmt_word">Covered with sackcloth.</span> Probably by the king's command. Hezekiah wished to emphasize his own horror and grief in the eyes of the prophet, and could only do so by making his messengers assume the garb which he had judged suitable for himself on the occasion. <span class="cmt_word">To Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</span> Nothing morels known of Amoz beyond his being Isaiah's father.

It is also a day of "rebuke," or rather of "chastisement" - a day on which God's hand lies heavy upon us and chastises us for our sins. And it is a day, not of "blasphemy," but of "abhorrence" or of "contumely" - a day on which God contumeliously rejects his people, and allows them to be insulted by their enemies (see the comments of Keil and Bahr). <span class="cmt_word">For the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</span> A proverbial expression, probably meaning that a dangerous crisis approaches, and that the nation has no strength to carry it through the peril.

He had also curtailed Hezekiah's dominions, detaching from them various cities with their territories, and attaching them to Ashdod, Gaza, and Ekron (ibid., p. 135). Thus it was only a "remnant" of the Jewish people that was left in the land (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7-9</a>).

The news of the words spoken by Rabshakeh had probably flown through the city, and reached him, and he had already laid the matter before God, and received God's instructions concerning it. He was therefore able to return an answer at once. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants</span>  - rather, <span class="accented">lackeys</span>; the term used is not the common one for "servants," viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, but a contemptuous one, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "foot-boys," or "lackeys" - <span class="cmt_word">of the King of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span>

Most modern critics translate, with the LXX., "I will put a spirit within him," and understand "a spirit of cowardice," or "a despondent mood" (Thenius), or "an extraordinary impulse of Divine inspiration, which is to hurry him blindly on" (Drechsler). But the idea of our translators, that the blast (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is external, and sent <span class="accented">upon</span> him, not put in him - that, in fact, the destruction of his army is referred to, seems defensible by such passages as <a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>. The prophecy was, no doubt, intentionally vague - enough for its immediate purpose, which was to comfort and strengthen Hezekiah - but not intended to gratify man's curiosity by revealing the exact mode in which God would work. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall hear a rumor</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">shall hear a hearsay</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be told something, which shall determine him on a hasty retreat. It is best, I think, to understand, not news of Tirhakah's advance (Knobel, Keil, Bahr), much less news of an insurrection in some other part of the empire (Cheyne), but information of the disaster to his army. It is no objection to this that Sennacherib was "with his army." No doubt he was. But he would learn the catastrophe from the mouth of some one who came into his tent and told him - he would "hear a hearsay" <span class="cmt_word">And shall return to his own land</span> (see ver. 36), <span class="cmt_word">and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> (On Sennacherib's murder, see the comment upon ver. 37.)

No further communication was held with him. He had outraged all propriety by his appeal to the "men upon the wall" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27-35</a>); and it seems to have been thought most dignified to give him no answer at all. He had offered no terms - he had simply delivered a summons to surrender, and the closed gates and guarded walls were a sufficient reply. So he felt, and returned to his master, <span class="accented">re</span> <span class="accented">infecta</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And found the King of Assyria warring against Libnah.</span> The position of Libnah relatively to Lachish is uncertain.

It has been placed at <span class="accented">Tel</span>-<span class="accented">es-Safieh</span>, twelve miles northeast of <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; at <span class="accented">Arak-el-Menshiyeh</span>, about five miles nearly due east of the same; and near <span class="accented">Umm-el-Bikar</span>, four miles south-east of <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>. A removal from Um-Lakis to Tel-el-Safieh would mean a retreat. A march from Um-Lakis to either of the other sites would he quite compatible with an intention to push on to Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">For he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span> Whether Lachish had been taken or not cannot be determined from these words. But we can scarcely suppose that a place of such slight strength can have defied the Assyrian arms successfully. It is beat therefore to suppose, with Keil and Thenius, that Lachish had been taken.

Sennacherib seems to have been induced to write to Hezekiah by the fact that he could not march against him at once. A forward movement on the part of Tirhakah was reported to him (ver. 9), and he thought it necessary to meet, or at least watch it. But he must vent his anger on the rebel Judaean monarch in some way. He sends a letter, therefore, as more weighty and impressive than a mere message. He warns Hezekiah against being himself deceived by Jehovah (ver. 10); and he expands his inductive argument in proof of the irresistible might of Assyria, by an enumeration of four more recent conquests (ver. 12). Otherwise, he does little but repeat what Rabshakeh had already urged. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard say of Tirhakah King of Ethiopia.</span> Tirhakah was one of the most distinguished of the later Egyptian monarchs. An Ethiopian by birth, and originally ruling from Napata over the Upper Nile valley from the First Cataract to (perhaps) Khartoum, he extended his dominion over Egypt probably about  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, maintaining, however, Shabatok, as a sort of puppet-king, upon the throne. About  <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> he succeeded Shabatok, and held the throne till  <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>, being engaged in many wars with the Assyrians. The native form of his name is "Tahrak" or "Tahark," the Assyrian "Tarku" or "Tarqu," the Greek "Taracos" or "Tearchon." He has left numerous memorials in Egypt and Ethiopia, and was regarded by the Greeks as a great conqueror. At the time of Sennacherib's second attack on Hezekiah (about  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>) he was, as appears in the text, not yet King of Egypt, but only of Ethiopia. Still, he regarded Egypt as practically under his suzerainty, and when it was threatened by Sennacherib's approach, he marched to the rescue. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he is come out to fight against thee.</span> He may have regarded himself as bound in honor to come to the relief of Hezekiah, or he may have been simply bent on defending his own territory.

Probably he spoke his convictions. He did not think it possible that Jerusalem could resist or escape him (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8-11</a> and 13, 14).

As the covenant God, who was enthroned above the cherubim, the Lord was bound to help his people, if they turned to him with faith in the time of their distress and entreated his assistance." <span class="cmt_word">Thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.</span> Thou art not, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> Sennacherib supposes, a mere local god, presiding over Judaea, and protecting it; but thou art the God of all the earth and of all its kingdoms, including his own, equally. Moreover, thou <span class="accented">alone</span> art the God of the kingdoms.

"Destroyed" is too strong a word. Hezekiah fully admits the boast of the Assyrian monarch, that he and his predecessors have had a wonderful career of success (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>); but he refuses to regard this past success as ensuring success in the future. All is in the hand of God, and will be determined as God pleases. It is not an iron necessity that rules the world, but a personal will, and this well may be affected by prayer, to which (ver. 19) he therefore has recourse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a></div><div class="verse">And have cast their gods into the fire: for they <i>were</i> no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And have east their gods into the fire.</span> The images worshipped by the various nations are regarded as "their <span class="accented">gods</span>," which they were, at any rate in the minds of the common people. The ordinary practice of the Assyrians was to carry off the images taken from a conquered people, and to set them up in their own country as trophies of victory (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>, where a similar practice is ascribed by anticipation to the Persians). But there are places in the inscriptions where the gods are said to have been "destroyed" or "burnt." It is reasonable to suppose that the images destroyed were those of wood, stone, and bronze, which had little or no intrinsic value, while the gold and silver idols were carried off to the land of the conqueror. No doubt idols of the former far outnumbered those of the latter kind, and, at each sack of a city the "gods" which it contained were mostly burnt. <span class="cmt_word">For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6, 7</a>). Wooden images (the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) were probably the earliest that were made, and, on account of their antiquity, were often especially reverenced. They were "carved, but rude, with undivided feet, and eyes indicated by a line, the face colored red, or white, or gilt. It was only later that ivory and gold plates were commonly laid over the wood, vested and decked out with ornaments" (Dollinger, 'Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 240). Stone idols were at first shapeless masses, then pillars or cones, finally imitations of the human form, varying from the rudest representations to the priceless statues of Phidias. In Assyrian times, neither the wooden nor the stone idols were possessed of any artistic beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they have destroyed them.</span> "Gods" of this kind could not help themselves, much less save their devotees or the cities supposed to be under their protection. It was not to be wondered at that the Assyrians had triumphed ever such gods.

Hezekiah insists that the idols are "no gods," are "nothing" - at any rate are mere blocks of wood and stone, shaped by human hands. But Jehovah is "the God of all the kingdoms of the earth" (ver. 15), the Maker of heaven and earth (ver. 15), the one and only God (ver. 19) - answering to his name, self-existing, all-sufficient, the groundwork of all other existence. And he is "our <span class="accented">God"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> the special God of Israel, bound by covenant to protect <span class="accented">there</span> against all enemies. <span class="cmt_word">I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "do that which this proud blasphemer thinks that thou canst not do" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-35.htm">2 Kings 18:35</a>); show him that thou art far mightier than he supposes, wholly unlike those "no-gods," over whom he has hitherto triumphed - a "very present Help in trouble" - potent to save. <span class="cmt_word">That all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God.</span> The glory of God is the end of creation; and God's true saints always bear the fact in mind, and desire nothing so much as that his glory should be shown forth everywhere and always. Moses, in his prayers for rebellious Israel in the wilderness, constantly urges upon God that it will not be for his glory to destroy or desert them (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26-29</a>). David, in his great strait, asks the destruction of his enemies, "that <span class="accented">men may know</span> that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>); and again (<a href="../../par/psalms/59-13.htm">Psalm 59:13</a>), "Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be; and let <span class="accented">them know</span> that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth." Hezekiah prays for a signal vengeance on Sennacherib, not for his own sake, not even for his people's sake, so much as for the vindication of God's honor among the nations of the earth - that it may be known far and wide that Jehovah is a God who can help, the real Ruler of the world, against whom earthly kings and earthly might avail nothing. Even thou only. It would not satisfy Hezekiah that Jehovah should be acknowledged as a mighty god, one of many. He asks for such a demonstration as shall convince men that he is unique, that he stands alone, that he is the <span class="accented">only</span> mighty God in all the earth.

God has "bowed down his ear" to it (ver. 16) - has taken it into his consideration, and has sent a reply. Then the reply follows, in fourteen verses arranged in four strophes or stanzas. The first (vers. 21-24) and second (vers. 25-28) are addressed to Sennacherib, and breathe a tone of scorn and contempt. The third (vers. 29-31), is addressed to Hezekiah, and is encouraging and consolatory. The fourth (vers. 32-34) is an assurance to all whom it may concern, that Jerusalem is safe, that Sennacherib will not take it, that he will not even commence its siege.

It adds great liveliness and force to the opening portion of the oracle, that it should be addressed directly by Jehovah to Sennacherib, as an answer to his bold challenge. The only address at all similar in Scripture is that to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31, 32</a>), spoken by "a voice from heaven" But the present passage is one of far greater force and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">The virgin the daughter of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the virgin daughter of Zion</span>, or <span class="accented">the virgin daughter</span>, <span class="accented">Zion</span>.

"Virgin daughter" here may perhaps represent "the consciousness of impregnability" (Drechsler); but the phrase seems to have been used rhetorically or poetically, to heighten the beauty or pathos of the picture (<a href="../../par/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>), without any reference to the question whether the particular city had or had not been previously taken. Jerusalem certainly had been taken by Shishak (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>), and by   Joash (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>); but Zion, if it be taken as the name of the eastern city (Bishop Patrick, <span class="accented">ad</span> lee.), may have been still a "virgin fortress." <span class="cmt_word">Hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn</span>; or, <span class="accented">despises thee and laughs thee to scorn</span>.

The chariot-force was the main arm of the Assyrian military service - that on which most dependence was placed, and to which victory was commonly attributed. The number of chariots that could be brought into the field by the Assyrians is nowhere stated; but we find nearly four thousand hostile chariots collected to oppose an ordinary Assyrian invasion, and defeated (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 362, note 8). The estimates of Cterias - eleven thousand for Ninas, and a hundred thousand for Semiramis (Died. Sic., 2:5. &sect; 4) - are, of course, unhistorical. <span class="cmt_word">I am come up to the height of the mountains.</span> "The height of the mountains" is here the high ground which an army would have to traverse in passing from the Coele-Syrian valley into Palestine. It is not exactly Lebanon, which runs parallel with the coast, and certainly does not "guard Palestine to the north," as Keil supposes; But it may be viewed as a "side" or "flank" of Lebanon. In point of fact, Lebanon and Hermon unite their roots to form a barrier between the Coele-Syrian plain (<span class="accented">El Buka'a</span>) and the valley of the Jordan, and an invader from the north must cross this barrier. It is not so difficult or rugged but that the Assyrians could bring their chariots ever it. They were accustomed to traverse far more difficult regions in Zagros and Niphatos and Taurus, and to carry their chariots with them, dismounting when necessary, and having the vehicles lifted over obstacles by human hands (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74). <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon.</span> An army which invades Palestine by the Coele-Syrian valley - quite the easiest and most usual line of invasion - necessarily passes along the entire eastern "side," or "flank," of Lebanon, which is the proper meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and not "loftiest height" (Keil), or "innermost recess" (Revised Version). The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, is natural when a mountain range, like Lebanon, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof.</span> The felling of timber in the Syrian mountain-chains was a common practice of the Assyrian invaders, and had two quite distinct objects. Sometimes it was mere cruel devastation, done to injure and impoverish the inhabitants; but more often it was done for the sake of the timber which the conqueror carried off into his own country. "The mountains of Amanus I ascended," says Asshur-nazir-pal; "wood for bridges, pines, box, cypress, I cut down... cedar-wood from Amanus I destined for Bit-Hira and my pleasure-house called Azmaku, and for the temple of the moon and sun, the exalted gods. I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges, and carried them to Nineveh" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 74). The cedar (<span class="accented">erez</span>) and the pine, or juniper (<span class="accented">berosh</span>), were in special request. <span class="cmt_word">And I will enter into the lodgings of his borders -</span> rather, the <span class="accented">lodge of its</span> border - perhaps a palace or hunting-lodge on the outskirt of the Lebanon forest region (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the forest of his Carmel</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">forest of its orchard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the choicest part of the Lebanon forest region - the part which is rather park or orchard than mere forest.

Sennacherib means that this is what he is wont to do. As mountains do not stop him (ver. 23), so deserts do not stop him - he digs wells in them, and drinks water "strange" to the soil - never before seen there. <span class="cmt_word">And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">will</span> 1 <span class="accented">dry up all the rivers of Egypt</span> (compare the Revised Version.

It is the old singular from which was formed the dual Mizraim. Whether it meant "land of strength" (Pusey), or "land of distress" (Ewald), may be doubted, since we have no right to assume a Hebrew derivation. There was probably a native word, from which the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mazor</span>, the Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span> were taken. Sennacherib's beast is that, as he makes deserts traversable by digging wells, so, if rivers try to stop him, he will find a way of drying them up. Compare the boasts of Alaric in Claudian ('Bell. Get.,' pp. 525-532), who had probably this passage of Kings in his thoughts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"To patior suadente fugam, cum cesserit omnis<br />Obsequiis natura meis?<br />Subsidere nostris Sub pedibus montes, arescere vidimus amnes<br />Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."</span>

Years before, when Assyria first became threatening, Isaiah, speaking in the person of Jehovah, had exclaimed, "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5, 6</a>). But the heathen kings whom God made his instruments to chasten sinful nations imagined that they conquered and destroyed and laid waste by their own strength (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7-14</a>).

They are like fascinated birds before the stealthy advance of the serpent. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed and confounded.</span> Historically, the prophet declares, this was the cause of the general collapse of the nations whom the Assyrians attacked.

In the hot sun of an Eastern sky nothing faded more quickly. But this weakness was intensified in the "grass of the house-tops." It "withered before it grew up" (<a href="../../par/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). The depth of earth was so slight, the exposure so great, the heat so scorching, that it sank in death almost as soon as it had sprung to life.

Jehovah claims an absolute knowledge of all that Sennacherib does or thinks, both when he is in action and when he is at rest. Nothing is hid from him (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-16</a>). Human pride should stand abashed before such absolute knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">And thy rage against me.</span> Opposition to their will fills violent men with fury and rage. Sennacherib's anger was primarily against Hezekiah, but when once he was convinced that Hezekiah really trusted in Jehovah (ver. 10), his fury would turn against God himself (see <a href="../../par/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>, where the Lord's anointed is primarily David). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a></div><div class="verse">Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult</span> - rather, <span class="accented">thy arrogancy</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span> is rather the quiet security of extreme pride and self-confidence than "tumult" - <span class="cmt_word">is come up into mine ears</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has attracted my notice - <span class="cmt_word">therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips.</span> The imagery is most striking. Captive kings were actually so treated by the Assyrians themselves. A hook or split-ring was thrust through the cartilage of the nose, or the fleshy part of the under lip, with a rope or thong attached to it, and in this guise they were led into the monarch's presence, to receive their final sentence at his hands. In the sculptures of Sargon at Khorsabad we see three prisoners brought before him in this fashion, one of whom he seems to be about to kill with a spear ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 367). In another sculpture set up by a Babylonian king, his vizier brings before him two captives similarly treated, but with the ring, apparently, passed through the cartilage of their noses (ibid., vol. 3. p. 436) Manasseh seems to have received the same treatment at the hands of the "captains" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) who brought him a prisoner to Esarhaddon at Babylon. Other allusions to the practice in Scripture will be found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>. The threat in the present passage was, of course, not intended to be understood life-rally, but only as a declaration that God would bring down the pride of Sennacherib, humiliate him, and reduce him to a state of abject weakness and abasement. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest</span> (comp. ver. 33). The meaning is clear. Sennacherib would not be allowed to come near Jerusalem. He would hurry back by the low coast route (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>), by which he had made his invasion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be a sign unto thee.</span> Another sudden change in the address. The prophet turns from Sennacherib to Hezekiah, and proceeds to give him a sign, and otherwise speak to him encouragingly. Signs were at the time freely offered and given by God both to the faithful and the unfaithful (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11, 14</a>). They generally consisted in the prediction of some near event, whose occurrence was to serve as a pledge, or evidence, of the probable fulfillment of another prediction of an event more distant. Such signs are not necessarily miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves.</span> The Assyrian invasion, coming early in the spring, as was usual, had prevented the Israelites from sowing their lands. But they would soon be gone, and then the Israelites could gather in such self-sown corn as they might find in the corn-lands. The next year, probably a sabbatical year, they were authorized to do the same, notwithstanding the general prohibition (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>); the third year they would return to their normal condition. The sign was not given with reference to Sennacherib's departure, which belonged to the first year, and must take place before the ingathering of the self-sown corn could begin, but with reference to the promise that Jerusalem should be free from any further attack on his part. Sennacherib reigned seventeen years longer, but led no further expedition into Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">And in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span>

The open country had been wasted, great numbers killed, and many probably carried off by famine and pestilence. Thus both Hezekiah (ver. 4) and Isaiah regard the population still in the land as a mere "remnant." <span class="cmt_word">Shall yet again take root downward</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, be firmly fixed and established in the land, like a vigorous tree that strikes its roots into the soil deeply - <span class="cmt_word">and bear fruit upward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> exhibit all the outward signs of prosperity.

The sequel is told in a few words. That night destruction came down on the host of Sennacherib, as it lay en-camped at some distance from Jerusalem, silently and swiftly. Without noise, without disturbance, the sleeping men slept the sleep of death, and in the morning, when the survivors awoke, it was found that a hundred and eighty-five thousand were slain. Upon this, with the remnant of his army, Sennacherib hastily returned to Nineveh. There, some time after - about seventeen years according to our reckoning  - a conspiracy was formed against him by two of his sons, who murdered him as he was worshipping in a temple, and fled into Armenia. Another son, Esarhaddon, succeeded. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass that night.</span> The important expression, "that night," is omitted from the narrative of <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, but is undoubtedly an original portion of the present history. It can have no other meaning - as Keil and Bahr have seen - than "the night following the day on which Isaiah had foretold to Hezekiah the deliverance of Jerusalem." God's word "runneth very swiftly." No sooner was the premise given than the destroying angel received his orders, and "that night" the terrible stroke fell. <span class="cmt_word">That the angel of the Lord went out</span>; or, <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). We cannot say, with Bahr, that it was "the same one who smote the firstborn in Egypt, and inflicted the pestilence after the census under David." Revelation does not tell us that there is definitely one destroying angel. "The angel of death" is a rabbinical invention. It accords rather with the analogy of God's dealings that he should use at one time the services of one minister, at another time those of another. <span class="cmt_word">And smote.</span> Imagination has been over-busy in conjecturing the exact manner of the smiting. Some critics have suggested pestilence, or more definitely "the plague" (Gesenius, Dathe, Maurer, Ewald, Winer, Thenins, Keil, etc.); others a terrible storm (Vitringa, Stanley); others the simoom (Prideaux, Milman); others a nocturnal attack by Tirhakah (Ussher, Preiss, Michaelis). Some of these the text altogether precludes, as the attack of Tirhakah, which must have aroused the whole host, and not left the disaster to be discovered by those who "awoke early in the morning." Others are improbable, as the simoom, or a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, which have never been known to accomplish such a destruction. Pestilence is no doubt possible, but a pestilence of a strange and miraculous character, to which men succumbed without awaking or disturbing others. But the narrative rather points to sudden and silent death during sleep, such as often happens to men in the course of nature singly, and here on this occasion was made to happen in one night to a hundred and eighty-five thousand men by the Divine omnipotence acting abnormally. <span class="cmt_word">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span> The destruction was not only at one time, but in one place. "The camp of the Assyrians" cannot mean half a dozen camps situated in half a dozen different places, as Keil supposes. Sennacherib was somewhere with his main army, encamped for the night, and there, wherever it was, the blow fell. But the exact locality is uncertain. All that the narrative makes clear is that it was not in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Herodotus places the catastrophe at Pelusium (2. 141). Bahr thinks it was probably before Libnah. I should incline to place it between Libnah and the Egyptian frontier, Sennacherib, when he heard that Tirhakah was coming against him (ver. 9), having naturally marched forward to meet and engage his army. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred four score and five thousand.</span> These figures do not pretend to exactness, and can scarcely have been more than a rough estimate. They are probably the Assyrians' own estimate of their loss, which the Jews would learn from such of the fugitives as fell into their hands. <span class="cmt_word">And when they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the survivors - <span class="cmt_word">arose early in the morning, they</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hundred and eighty-five thousand  - <span class="cmt_word">were all dead corpses</span> - absolutely dead, that is; not merely sick or dying. The fact makes against the theory of a pestilence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/19-36.htm">2 Kings 19:36</a></div><div class="verse">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Sennacherib King of Assyria departed, and went and returned.</span> The, original is more lively, and more expressive of haste. Sennacherib, it is said, "decamped, and departed, and returned" - the heaping up of the verbs expressing the hurry of the march home (Keil); comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt at Nineveh.</span> Nineveh was Sennacherib's favorite residence. He had built himself a palace, there, marked by the modern mound of Koyunjik. Sargon, his father, had dwelt mainly at Dur-Sargina or Khorsabad, Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaueser at Calah or Nimrod. Sennacherib's palace and his ether buildings at Nineveh are described in his annals at some length (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 50-52). The expression, "dwelt at Nineveh," does not mean that he never quitted it, but merely implies that he dwelt there for some considerable time after his return, as he appears to have done by his annals. The Eponym Canon makes his last year  <span class="date">B.C. 682</span>.

It has been connected with <span class="accented">nesher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), "eagle," and explained as a reference to the eagle-headed genius sometimes seen in the Assyrian sculptures ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 265). But there is no evidence that the genii were ever worshipped in Assyria, much less that they had temples of their own, nor is any name resembling "Nisroch" attached to any of them. The word itself is somewhat doubtful, and different manuscripts of the Septuagint, here and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, have the variants of <span class="accented">Nasaraeh</span>, <span class="accented">Esorach</span>, <span class="accented">Meserach</span>, and <span class="accented">Asarach</span>, while Josephus has <span class="accented">Araskas</span>. Asarach might conceivably be a strengthened form of Asshur; but the substitution of <span class="accented">samech</span> for <span class="accented">shin</span> is against this explanation. Still, Asshur was certainly Sennacherib's favorite god, the deity whom he principally worshipped. Josephus regards the name as belonging, not to the god, but to the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which is perhaps the true solution of the difficulty.

Neither form resembles any known Assyrian name, but <span class="accented">Adrammelech has a good</span> Semitic derivation (see the comment on 2 Kings 18:31). "Sharezer" is probably a shortened form of Nergal-shar-ozer (comp. "Shalman," <a href="../../par/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), which was a name in use at the time ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68).
