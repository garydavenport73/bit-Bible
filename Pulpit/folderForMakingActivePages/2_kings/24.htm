It was borne by three distinct kings of Babylon, the most important of whom was Nebuchadnezzar III., the son of Nabopolassar, the monarch of the present passage. According to Berosus, he was not at the time of this expedition the actual sovereign of Babylonia, but only the crown prince, placed by the actual king, Nabopolassar, at the head of his army. It is possible that his father may have associated him in the kingdom, for association was not unknown at Babylon; or the Jews may have mistaken his position; or the historian may call him king by <span class="accented">prolepsis</span>, as a modern might say, "The Emperor Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the Austrians at Marengo" (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 400). His father had grown too old and infirm to conduct a military expedition, and consequently sent his son in his place, with the object of chastising Nechoh, and recovering the territory whereof Nechoh had made himself master three years before (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-33</a>, and compare below, ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim became his servant</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> submitted to him, and became a tributary king - <span class="cmt_word">three years</span> (from  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 602</span>): <span class="cmt_word">then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> How Jehoiakim came to venture on this step we are not told, and can only conjecture. It is, perhaps, most probable that (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:6, &sect; 2) he was incited to take this course by the Egyptians, who were still under the rule of the brave and enterprising Nechoh, and who may have hoped to wipe out by fresh victories the disaster experienced at Carehemish. There is, perhaps, an allusion to Jehoiakim's expectation of Egyptian succors in the statement of ver. 7, that "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his land."

As W. G. Sumner well observes, "The sins of Manasseh had become a designation for a certain class of offences, and a particular form of public and social depravity, which was introduced by Manassseh, but of which generation after generation continued to be guilty." The special sins were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> idolatry, accompanied by licentious rites; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> child-murder, or sacrifice to Moloch; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sodomy (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the use of enchantments and the practice of magical arts (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>).

Like the other "sins of Manasseh," the shedding of innocent blood continued, both in the Moloch offerings (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>) and in the persecution of the righteous (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6, 9</a>, etc.).

How Nebuchadnezzar treated him is uncertain. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) that he put him to death, and east him out unburied beyond the walls of the city. But from the biblical notices we can only gather that he died prematurely after a reign of no more than eleven years ( <span class="date">B.C. 608</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 597</span>), and was u-lamented, "buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). Conjecture has filled up the blanks of this history in several ways, the most purely imaginative being, perhaps, that of Ewald, who says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 262), "When the Chaldean armies presented themselves at the gates of the capital, Jehoiakim seems to have been betrayed into the same error as his brother (Jehoahaz), eleven years before. He gave ear to a crafty invitation of the enemy to repair for negotiations to their camp, where, in sight of his own city, he was made prisoner. He offered a frantic resistance, and was dragged away in a scuffle, and miserably cut down; while even an honorable burial for his corpse, which his family certainly solicited, was refused."

Jehoiachin has in Scripture the two other names of Jeconiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>) and Coniah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>). Jehoiachin and Jeconiah differ only, as Jehoahaz and Ahaziah, by a reversal of the order of the two elements. Both mean "Jehovah will establish (him)." "Conlah" cuts off from "Jeconiah" the sign of futurity, and means "Jehovah establishes." It is used only by Jeremiah, and seems used by him to signify that though "Jehovah establishes," Jeconiah he would <span class="accented">not</span> establish.

The short reign of Jehoisshin is now described. It lasted but three months. For some reason which is unrecorded, Nebuchadnezzar, who had placed him on the throne, took offence at his conduct, and sent an army against him to effect his deposition. Jehoiachin offered scarcely any resistance. He "went out" of the city (ver. 12), with the queen-mother, the officers of the court, and the princes, and submitted himself to the will of the great king. But he gained nothing by his pusillanimity. The Babylonians entered Jerusalem, plundered the temple and the royal palace, made prisoners of the king, his mother, the princes and nobles, the armed garrison, and all the more skilled artisans, to the number altogether of ten thousand souls (Josephus says 10,832, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 1), and carried them captive to Babylon. Zedekiah, the king's uncle, was made monarch in his room. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign.</span> In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> he is said to have been only eight years old, but this is probably an accidental corruption, the <span class="accented">yod</span>, which is the Hebrew sign for ten, easily slipping out.

His daughter, Nehushta - the Noste of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) - was probably the ruling spirit of the time during her son's short reign. We find mention of her in Jeremiah 26:26; 29:2; and in Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3, and Jeremiah 10:7. &sect; 1. Ewald suggests that she "energetically supported" her son in the policy whereby he offended Nebuchadnezzar.

The present passage probably does not mean more than that he made no attempt at a religious reformation, but allowed the idolatries and superstitions which had prevailed under Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim to continue. It is in his favor that he did not actively persecute Jeremiah.

Nebuchadnezzar found a son of Josiah, named Mattaniah, still surviving at Jerusalem. At his father's death he must have been a boy of ten, but he was now, eleven years later, of the age of twenty-one. This youth, only three years older than his nephew Jehoiachin, he appointed king, at the same time requiring him to change his name, which he did from "Mattaniah" to "Zedekiah" (ver. 17). Zedekiah pursued nearly the same course of action as the other recent kings. He showed no religious zeal, instituted no reform, but allowed the idolatrous practices, to which the people were so addicted, to continue (ver. 19). Though less irreligious and less inclined to persecute than Jehoiakim, he could not bring himself to turn to God. He was weak and vacillating, inclined to follow the counsels of Jeremiah, but afraid of the "princes," and ultimately took their advice, which was to ally himself with Egypt, and openly rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. This course of conduct brought about the destruction of the nation (ver. 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead.</span> Josiah had four sons (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>) - Johanan, the eldest, who probably died before his father; Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, the second, who was twenty-five years old at his father's death (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>); Jehoahaz, the third, otherwise called Shallum (1 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>), who, when his father died, was aged twenty-three (2 Kings 32:31); and Mattaniah, the youngest, who must have been then aged ten or nine. It was this fourth son, now grown to manhood, whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed king in Jehoiachin's room. <span class="cmt_word">And changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> (On the practice of changing a king's name on his accession, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34</a>.) Mat-lab means "Gift of Jehovah;" Zedekiah, "Righteousness of Jehovah." Josiah had called his son the first of these names in humble acknowledgment of God's mercy in granting him a fourth son. So other pious Jews called their sons "Nathaniel," and Greeks "Theodotus" or "Theodorus," and Romans "Deodatua." Mattaniah, in taking the second of the names, may have had in his mind the prophecy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a>, where blessings are promised to the reign of a king whose name should be "<span class="accented">Jehovah-Tsidkenu</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The Lord our Righteousness." Or he may simply have intended to declare that "the righteousness of Jehovah" was what he aimed at establishing. In this case it can only be said that it would have been happy for his country, had his professions been corroborated by his acts.

To be "cast out of God's presence" is to lose his protecting care, to be separated off from him, to be left defenseless against our enemies.

Zedekiah, when he received his investiture at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (ver. 17), took a solemn oath of allegiance and fidelity (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>) to him and to his successors; but almost immediately afterwards he began to intrigue with Egypt, sent a contingent of troops to help Psamatik II. in his wars (Wiediemann, 'Geschichte AEgyptens,' p. 159), and thus sought to pave the way for an Egyptian alliance, on the strength of which he might venture upon a revolt. It was probably owing to the suspicions which these acts aroused that, in the fourth year of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 594</span>, he had to visit Babylon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), where, no doubt, he renewed his engagements and assured the Babylonian monarch of his fidelity. But these proceedings were nothing but a blind. On the accession of Hophra (Apries) to the throne of Egypt in  <span class="date">B.C. 591</span>, Zedekiah renewed his application to the Egyptian court, openly sending ambassadors (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>), with a request for infantry and cavalry. Thus was his rebellion complete, his "oath despised," and his "covenant broken" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15, 16</a>). The war with Babylon, and the siege of Jerusalem, were the natural consequences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
