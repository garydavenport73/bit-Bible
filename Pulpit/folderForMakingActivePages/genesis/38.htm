The present chapter appears to interrupt the continuity of the narrative of Joseph's history. Partly on this account, and partly because the name Jehovah occurs in it (vers. 7, 10), it has been pronounced a later Jehovistic interpolation (Tuch, Bleek, Davidson, Coleuso). Its design has been explained as an attempt to glorify the line of David by representing it as sprung from Judah (Bohlen), or to disclose the origin of the Levitate law of marriage among the Jews (Knobel); but the incidents here recorded of Judah and his family are fitted to reflect dishonor instead of glory on the ancestry of David (Havernick); and the custom here mentioned of raising up seed to a dead brother by marrying his widow, though the idea may have originated with Judah (Lange), is more likely to have descended from earlier times (Delitzsch, Keil). Rightly understood, the object of the present portion of the record appears to have been not simply to prepare the way for the subsequent (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-27</a>) genealogical register (Gerlach), or to contrast the wickedness of Judah and his sons with the piety and chastity of Joseph in Egypt (Wordsworth), or to recite the private history of one of Christ's ancestors (Bush, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or to show that the pre-eminence of Judah in the patriarchal family was due exclusively to grace (Candlish), but also and chiefly to justify the Divine procedure in the subsequent deportation of Jacob and his sons to Egypt (Keil). The special danger to which the theocratic family was exposed was that of intermarrying with the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-6.htm">Genesis 28:6</a>). Accordingly, having carried forward his narrative to the point where, in consequence of Joseph's sale, a way begins to open up for the transference of the patriarchal house to the lend of the Pharaohs, the historian makes a pause to introduce a passage from the life of Judah, with the view of proving the necessity of such removal, by showing, as in the case of Judah, the almost certainty that, if left in Canaan, the descendants of Jacob would fall before the temptation of marrying with the daughters of the land, with the result, in the first instance, of a great and rapid moral deterioration in the holy seed, and with the ultimate effect of completely obliterating the line of demarcation between them and the surrounding heathen world. How the purity of the patriarchal family was guarded till it developed into a powerful nation, first by its providential withdrawment in infancy from the sphere of temptation (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-5.htm">Genesis 46:5</a>), then by its separate establishment in Goshen beside a people who regarded them with aversion (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>), and latterly by its cruel enslavement under Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>), is a subject which in due course engages the attention of the writer. <span class="cmt_word">At that time.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the date of Judah's marriage, as is most probable, was shortly after the sale of Joseph (Keil, Kurtz, Lange, Alford, Wordsworth, Quarry), since at the time of that atrocity Judah was still living with his brethren, the only difficulty calling for solution is to account for the birth of Judah's grandchildren, Hezron and Hamul (the sons of Pharez, the twin child of Judah by Tamar), in the short interval of twenty-two years which preceded Jacob's descent into Egypt without making Er and Onan marry in comparative boyhood. The case becomes a little less perplexing if Hezron and Hamul, though said to have come into Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>), may be regarded as having been born there (Hengstenberg), since twenty-two years afford sufficient space for the birth of Judah's three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah, which may have taken place during the first three years after their father's marriage, and for the birth of Pharez and Zarah, even if Er married as late as eighteen. Of course if the narrative requires the birth of Hezron and Hamul to have taken place in Canaan (Kalisch), it is simply impossible to hold that all this occurred within little more than a score of years. Hence <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the date of Judah's marriage has been placed before the sale of Joseph (Augustine, Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Drechsler, Baumgarten, Gerlach, Ainsworth, Candlish, Murphy, Inglis); but even on this assumption the task is arduous to make the birth of Hezron and Hamul occur before the emigration of their great-grandfather to Egypt. For as Judah was not more than four years older than Joseph (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a> with Genesis 30:25), his age at the time of Joseph's sale could not have been more than twenty-one. But placing Judah's marriage at the earliest possible date, viz., in his fifteenth year, only substitutes an interval of twenty-eight years instead of one of twenty-two, in which Judah's son Er must be born, grow up to manhood, (say at fifteen) marry, die, and leave his widow Tamar, who, after marrying with Onan and waiting for Shelah (which would consume at least another year), must become the mother of twin sons by her father-in-law (for which another year would be required), and must see the elder of the two married at ten years of age, if his sons are to be born upon the soft of Canaan. On either hypothesis, therefore, it seems indispensable to hold that Judah's grandsons were born in Egypt; and in this case there is little gained by putting Judah's marriage earlier than Joseph s sale, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Judah's twenty-first year. <span class="cmt_word">That Judah went down</span> - from Hebron (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>), or the mountains (Keil), towards the south (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller) <span class="cmt_word">from his brethren</span>, - setting up a separate and independent establishment apart from them; "not only immediately after Joseph was sold, but also on account of it," "in a fit of impenitent anger" (Kurtz), in a spirit of remorse (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">and turned in to a certain Adullamite</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">and pitched</span> (sc. his tent, <a href="../../par/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>) <span class="accented">up to, as</span> far as, or close by, a man, <span class="accented">an Adullamite, i.e.</span> belonging to Adullam, a town in the Hebron valley (Joshua 15:85); in the time of the conquest the seat of a Canaanitish king (<a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), afterwards celebrated for its connection with the history of David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>), subsequently mentioned in Scripture (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>), but never successfully identified (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607; Robinson, 2:175) - <span class="cmt_word">whose name was Hirah</span> - "Nobility" (Gesenius).

Though willing to commit adultery or fornication, Judah would have shrank from the sin of incest. <span class="cmt_word">And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</span> The conduct of Tamer, though in every way reprehensible, is not to be attributed to mere lust, or inordinate desire for offspring, if not from the son Shelah, then from the father Judah, but was probably traceable to a secret wish on the one hand to be avenged on Judah, and on the other hand to assert her right to a place amongst the ancestresses of the patriarchal family. Yet Tamar was really guilty of both adultery and incest, though Lange thinks the wickedness of Er and Onan renders this open to question.

The seals and signets that have been brought to light by the excavations in Assyria and Babylon (Layard, 'Nin. and Bab.,' 152-159, 602-608) are of various forms and materials. They show the art of engraving to have been of great antiquity; but whether Judah's signet was marked with alphabetical characters cannot be determined, though it may have been, since alphabetical writing was as old at least as the time of Abraham (vide Keil, 'Introd.,' Part I. sect. 1. <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. &sect; 4) - <span class="cmt_word">and thy bracelets</span> (rather, thy chain, <span class="accented">pithil</span>, ut supra), <span class="cmt_word">and thy staff</span> (the <span class="accented">mateh</span>, or rod, was so called from the idea of stretching out, the root being <span class="accented">natah</span>, to stretch out or extend) <span class="cmt_word">that is in thine hand</span>.
