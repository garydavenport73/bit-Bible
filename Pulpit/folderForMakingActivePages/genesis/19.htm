Corresponding to the ancient forum of the Romans, or agora of the Greeks, the city gate among the Hebrews was the customary place of resort for the settlement of disputes, the transaction of business, or the enjoyment of ordinary social intercourse (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). It was probably an arch with deep recesses, in which were placed chairs for the judges or city magistrates, and seats or benches for the citizens who had business to transact. So Homer describes the Trojan elders as sitting at the Scaean gate (3. 148). In what capacity Lot was sitting in the gate is not narrated. That he was on the outlook for travelers on whom to practice the hospitality he had learned from his uncle (Peele, Calvin, Willet, Lange) is perhaps to form too high an ideal of his piety (Kalisch); while the explanation that he had been pro-meted to the dignity of one of the city judges, though not perhaps justified as an inference from Ver. 9, is not at all unlikely, considering his relationship to Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">And Lot seeing them</span> (and recognizing them to be strangers by their dress and looks) <span class="cmt_word">rose up to meet them</span>; - having not yet abandoned the practice of hospitality, or forgotten, through mingling with the Sodomites, the respectful courtesy which was due to strangers, since the writer adds - <span class="cmt_word">and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>).

Though an act of kindness on the part of Lot, his invitation was not accepted by the angels obviously with a view to try his character (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/24-28.htm">Luke 24:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</span> Literally, for in the <span class="accented">broad open spaces</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the streets of the <span class="accented">town</span>) <span class="accented">we will pass the night</span>; no great hardship in that climax.

Their proposal was revolting and unnatural in the extreme. By subsequent Mosaic legislation a transgression of such enormity was rendered punishable by death. Even in the present instance the perpetrators were not wholly unconscious of the wickedness of their conduct. The fact that they required a stratagem for the attainment of their purpose shows that at least they could not calculate on their father's approbation. The entire story has been regarded as the invention of later Jewish hatred to the Moabites and Ammonites (De Wette), a conjecture believed by some to be " not improbable (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but if so, how should the same writer exhibit Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) as filled with compassionate tenderness towards the cities of the plain?

The reading, "when <span class="accented">he</span> lay down and when he arose (LXX.) is incorrect, and the explanations that Lot was a mere unconscious instrument in this disgraceful transaction (Kalisch), that he was-entirely ignorant of all that had taken place (Chrysostom, Cajetan), that he was struck on account of his intemperance with a spirit of stupor (Calvin), are not warranted by the text.

The facility with which Lot allowed himself to be inebriated by his daughters Clericus regards as a sign that before this the old man had been accustomed to over-indulgence in wine. The inference, however, of Kalisch, that because "Lot's excess in the enjoyment of wine is no more blamed than it was in Noah," "the narrative exempts him from all serious reproach," can scarcely be admitted. <span class="cmt_word">And the younger arose, and lay with him</span> (following the bad example of her sister); <span class="cmt_word">and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>, Ver. 33).
