They had been confederate in their wickedness, they should in future, when returning to occupy their God. assigned inheritance, be disjoined. That this prediction was exactly fulfilled Scripture testifies. At the second census in the wilderness, shortly before the conquest, the tribe of Simeon had become so reduced in its numbers (reckoning only 22,000 as against 76,500 in Judah) as to be the smallest of the twelve (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>); to be passed over entirely in the last blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>.); to be accorded no independent allotment of territory in Canaan on the completion of the conquest, having only a few cities granted to it within the borders of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>); and to be ultimately absorbed in the more powerful and distinguished tribe under whose protection and tutelage, so to speak, it had been placed (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The tribe of Levi also was deprived of a separate inheritance, receiving only a number of cities scattered here and there among the possessions of their brethren (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1, 40</a>); and, though by its election to the priesthood the curse may be said to have been turned into a blessing, yet of this signal honor which was waiting Levi Jacob was completely silent, showing both that no prophecy was of any private interpretation (the seer seeing no further than the Holy Spirit helped him), and that Jacob spoke before the days of Moses. It is almost incredible that a late writer would have omitted to forecast the latter-day glory of the tribe of Levi; and this opinion is confirmed by observing the very different strain in which, after Levi s calling had been revealed, the benediction of Moses himself proceeds (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>).

Not only would Judah s soil be so fertile that its vines should be employed for trying asses and colts to their branches, but the grapes of those vines should be so plentiful and luscious as to make wine run like the water in which he washed his clothes, while the wine and milk should be so exhilarating and invigorating as to imp-art a sparkling brilliance to the eyes and a charming whiteness to the teeth. The aged prophet, it has been appropriately remarked, has here no thought of debauchery, but only paints before the mind's eye a picture of the richest and most ornate enjoyment (Lange). <span class="accented">Minime consentaneum esse videtur profusam intemperiem et projectionem in benedictione censeri</span> (Calvin).

Under the image of a fruit tree, probably a vine, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, planted by a well, whence it draws forth necessary moisture, and, sending forth its young twigs or offshoots over the supporting walls, he pictures the fruitfulness and prosperity which should afterwards attend the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, as the twofold representative of Joseph, with perhaps a backward glance at the service which Joseph had performed in Egypt by gathering up and dispensing the produce of the land for the salvation of his family and people. <span class="cmt_word">The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him</span> - literally, they <span class="accented">provoked him, and shot at, and laid snares for him, masters of arrows</span>, though Kalisch translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and they assembled in multitudes, which yields a sense sufficiently clear. It is sometimes alleged (Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary') that the words contain no allusion to the personal history of Joseph, but solely to the later fortunes of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh; but even if they do point to the subsequent hostilities which Joseph's descendants should incur (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4-6</a>), it is almost morally certain that the image of the shooting archers which he selects to depict their adversaries was suggested to his mind by the early lot of his beloved son (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Gerlach, Murphy, and others). <span class="cmt_word">But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</span> Notwithstanding the multitudinous and fierce assaults which had been made on Joseph, he had risen superior to his adversaries; his bow had continued firm and unbroken (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>), and his arms had been rendered active and flexible - neither <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX.), <span class="accented">dissoluta sunt vincula brachiorum et manuum</span> (Vulgate), as if Joseph s enemies were the subjects referred to; nor, "Therefore gold was placed upon his arms (Onkelos, Raehi, and others), referring to the gift of Pharaoh's ring - by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, i.e. God, who had proved himself to be Jacob's Mighty One by the powerful protection vouchsafed to his servant The title here ascribed to God occurs afterwards in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.</span> If the clause is parenthetical, it may signify either that from the time of Joseph's exaltation he became the shepherd (who sustained) and the stone of (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rock which supported) Israel (Oleaster); or that from God, the Mighty One of Jacob, Joseph received strength to become the shepherd and stone of Israel (Pererius, Ainsworth, Lawson, Patrick, and others), in which capacity he served as a prefiguration of the Good Shepherd who was also to become the Rock or Foundation of his Church (Calvin, Pererius, Candiish, &c.); but if the clause is rather co-ordinate with that which precedes and that which follows, as the introductory particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> appears to suggest, then the words "shepherd and stone of Israel" will apply to <span class="accented">God</span>, and the sentiment will be that the hands of Joseph were made strong from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, from there (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from there where is, or from him who is) the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Gerlach, Lange, <span class="accented">et alii</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from the</span> (<span class="accented">led of thy father, and he shall help thee</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who shall help thee); <span class="cmt_word">and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">with</span> (sc. the aid <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">the Almighty, and he shall bless</span> thee. It is unnecessary to change <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (LXX., Vulgate, Samaritan, Syriac, Ewald), or to insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, as thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (Knobel, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch), since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> may be understood here, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, in the sense of helpful communion (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb</span>. "From the God of Jacob, and by the help of the Almighty, should the rain and dew of heaven (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>), and fountains and brooks which spring from the great deep or the abyss of the earth, pour their fertilizing waters over Joseph's land, so that everything that had womb and breast should become pregnant, bring forth and suckle" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.</span> The meaning is, according to this rendering, which some adopt (the Targums, Vulgate, Syriac, Saadias, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), that the blessings which Jacob pronounced upon Joseph surpassed those which he himself had received from Abraham and Isaac, either as far as the primary mountains towered above the earth (Keil, Murphy), or, while exceeding the benedictions of his ancestors, those now delivered by himself would last while the hills endured (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'). But the words may be otherwise rendered: "The blessings of thy father prevail over, are mightier than the blessings of the mountains of eternity, the delight, or glory, or loveliness of the hills of eternity (LXX., Dathe, Michaelis, Gesenius, Bohlen, Kalisch, Gerlach, and others); and in favor of this may be adduced the beautiful parallelism between the last two clauses, which the received translation overlooks. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren</span> - literally, of <span class="accented">him, the separated</span> (from <span class="accented">nazar, to separate</span>) <span class="accented">from his brethren</span> (Onkelos, Rashi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, and others), though by some different renderings are preferred, as, e.g., the crowned among his brethren (LXX. Syriac, Targum of Jerusalem, Kimchi, Kalisch, Gerlach), taking <span class="accented">nazir</span> to signify he who wears the <span class="accented">nezer</span>, or royal diadem.
