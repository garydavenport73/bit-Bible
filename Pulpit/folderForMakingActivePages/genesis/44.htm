"Small pieces of gold or silver, together with precious stones, marked with strange figures and signs, were thrown into the vessel; after which certain incantations were pronounced, and the evil demon was invoked; the latter was then supposed to give the answer either by intelligible words, or by pointing to some of the characters on the precious stones, or in some other more mysterious manner. Sometimes the goblet was filled with pure water, upon which the sun was allowed to play; and the figures which were thus formed, or which a lively imagination fancied it saw, were interpreted as the desired omen" (Kalisch). Traces of this ancient practice of soothsaying have been detected by some writers in the magnificent vase of turquoise belonging to Jam-shoed, the Solomon of Persia. Like Merlin's cup, described by Spenser ('Faery Queens,' 3:2, 19) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"It vertue had to show in perfect sight<br />Whatever thing was in the world contained<br />Betwixt the lowest earth and heven's hight,<br />So that it to the looker appertaynd."</span> A similar account is given by Homer of the cup of Nestor; and Alexander the Great is reported to have possessed a mystic goblet of a like kind. It is said that in the storming of Seringapatam the unfortunate Tippeo Saib retired to gaze on his divining cup, and that after standing awhile absorbed in it he returned to the fight and fell (vide Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' art. Divination). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have done evil in so doing.</span>

For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever</span> (vide <a href="../../par/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, and now), <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman</span> (or servant) <span class="cmt_word">to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> "There was no duty that imperiously prohibited Judah from taking the place of his unfortunate brother. His children, and even his wife, if he had been in the married state, might have been sent to Egypt. He was so far master of his own liberty that he could warrantably put himself in Benjamin's room, if the governor gave his consent" (Lawson). <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall find</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my father</span>. The sublime heroism of this noble act of self-sacrifice on the part of Judah it is impossible to over-estimate. In behalf of one whom he knew was preferred to a higher place in his father's affection than himself, he was willing to renounce his liberty rather than see his aged parent die of a broken heart. The self-forgetful magnanimity of such an action has never been eclipsed, and seldom rivaled. After words so exquisitely beautiful and profoundly pathetic it was impossible for Joseph to doubt that a complete change had passed upon his brethren, and in particular upon Judah, since the day when he had eloquently urged, and they had wickedly consented, to sell their brother Joseph into Egypt. Everything was now ready for the denouement in this domestic drama. The story of Joseph's discovery of himself to his astonished brethren is related in the ensuing chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
