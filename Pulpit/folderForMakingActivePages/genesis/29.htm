"Who that has traveled much in this country has not often arrived at a well in the heat of the day which was surrounded with numerous flocks of sheep waiting to be watered? I once saw such a scene in the burning plains of Northern Syria. Half-naked, fierce-looking men were drawing up water in leather buckets; flock after flock was brought up, watered, and sent away; and after all the men had ended their work, then several women and girls brought up their flocks, and drew water for them. Thus it was with Jethro's daughters; and thus, no doubt, it would have been with Rachel if Jacob had not rolled away the stone and watered her sheep" ('Land and Book,' p. 589). <span class="cmt_word">For out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.</span> "Most of the cisterns are covered with a large thick, flat stone, in the center of which a hole is cut, which forms the mouth of the cistern. This hole, in many instances, we found covered with a heavy stone, to the removal of which two or three men were requisite" (Robinson, 2. p. 180).

From the middle of ver. 2 the words are parenthetical, the watering of the flocks not having taken place till Rachel had arrived (ver. 9) and Jacob had uncovered the well (ver. 10).

This could scarcely fail to remind Jacob of God's premise to guide him in his journey.

The language of the shepherds being Chaldaean (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/31-47.htm">Genesis 31:47</a>), Jacob, who spoke Hebrew, was able to converse with them either because he had learnt Chaldee from his mother (Clericus), or, as is more probable, because the dialects were not then greatly dissimilar (Gosman in Lange).

If Jacob had not yet discovered who he was to the fair shepherdess, his behavior must have filled her with surprise, even allowing for the unaffected simplicity of the times; but the fact that she does not resent his conduct as an undue liberty perhaps suggests that he had first informed her of his relationship to the inmates of Laban s house (Calvin).

She must herself have been attached to Jacob; and it is probable that Laban had explained to her his plan for bringing about a double wedding. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/29-24.htm">Genesis 29:24</a></div><div class="verse">And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid <i>for</i> an handmaid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah</span> - "the Dropping"?

This was in accordance with Oriental custom (<span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 14:61). That Leah obtained only one damsel need not be ascribed to Laban's parsimonious character, but to his already-formed intention to bestow a second on Rachel.

So the Lord oftentimes rewards evil-doers <span class="accented">according</span> to their wickedness (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he said to Laban</span> (who, Calvin conjectures, had given Jacob a splendid entertainment the night before to make him say nothing about the fraud), <span class="cmt_word">What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</span> It says much for Jacob that he did not seek to repudiate the marriage. Perhaps he saw the hand of God in what had happened, and probably considered that though he had chosen Rachel, God had selected Leah as his wife. If so, it must be set to Jacob's credit that at the call of God, thus providentially addressed to him, he was prepared to sacrifice his best affections to the claims of religion and duty. It is not Jacob, but Laban, who proposes that he should also marry Rachel.

The polygamy of Jacob, though contrary to the law of nature (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21-25</a>), admits of some palliation, since Rachel was the choice of his affections The marriage of sisters was afterwards declared incestuous (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-18.htm">Leviticus 18:18</a>).

The present section (vers. 31-35) is by Davidson, Kalisch, and others assigned to the Jehovist, by Tuch left undetermined, and by Colenso in several parts ascribed to the Elohist.

The fruitfulness of Leah and the sterility of Rachel were designed not so much to equalize the conditions of the sisters, the one having beauty and the other children (Lange), or to punish Jacob for his partiality (Keil), or to discourage the admiration of mere beauty (Kalisch), but to prove that "the origin of Israel was to be a work not of nature, but of grace" (Keil).
