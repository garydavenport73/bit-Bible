This phrase occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). It means the revelation which Jesus Christ makes, not that which reveals him. John is the <span class="accented">writer</span>, Jesus Christ the <span class="accented">Author</span>, of the book. Revelation (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word reserved for the gospel; no Old Testament prophecy is called a revelation (contrast <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-30.htm">1 Samuel 20:30</a>). It means the <span class="accented">unveiling</span> of Divine mysteries (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>), and from this it easily slips into meaning the mystery unveiled. Christ is both the Mystery and the Revealer of it. He comes to reveal himself, and in himself the Father, whose Image he is. Thus in its opening words the book takes us beyond itself. What is revealed is not secrets about the future, but a Person. And the Revealer is not man, but God; not John, but the Divine Son, commissioned by the Father. For even the unincarnate Word receives from the Father that which he reveals. <span class="cmt_word">Which God gave unto him</span>. This is remarkably in harmony with the Christology of the Fourth Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/5-20.htm">John 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-7.htm">John 17:7, 8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The simple infinitive to express a purpose after "give" is common to Gospel and Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-52.htm">John 6:52</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His servants.</span> All Christians, not exclusively seers like St. John. "<span class="accented">Even</span> the things which" (Revised Version) makes "things which" in apposition with "the Revelation," which is probably right. <span class="cmt_word">Must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); because God has so decreed. This Divine "must" is frequent in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shortly</span>. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is much disputed. But, like "firstborn" in the question about the brethren of the Lord, "shortly" ought not to be pressed in determining the scope of the Apocalypse. Calling Jesus the <span class="accented">firstborn</span> Son of Mary tells us nothing as to her having other children. Saying that the Apocalypse shows things which must <span class="accented">shortly</span> come to pass tells us nothing as to its referring to events near St. John's own day. Probably it refers to them <span class="accented">and</span> to much else in the Christian dispensation. In the language of the seer, past, present, and future are interwoven together as seen by God, and more truth is contained than the seer himself knows. "The whole book ought to be received as a single word uttered in a single moment" (Bengel). It does not follow, because St. John had events near to his own day in his mind, that his words are limited to those events for us (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>:<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; see Westcott, 'Historic Faith,' pp. 74, 75, and note on 1 John 2:18 in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools'). <span class="cmt_word">Signified</span>. Jesus Christ signified, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made known by symbol and figure, the things which must come to pass. "Signify" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is characteristic of St. John, to whom wonders are "signs" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of Divine truths. "This he said, <span class="accented">signifying</span> [by means of an allegory] by what manner of death he should die" (<a href="../../par/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>; comp. 18:32; 21:19). <span class="cmt_word">By his angel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by means of his angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). "Angel" here probably has its, common meaning of a spiritual messenger from the unseen world; but it is the fact of his being Christ's messenger, rather than his heavenly character, that is specially indicated. Whether one and the same angel is employed throughout the Revelation is not clear. He does not come into the foreground of the narrative until <a href="../../par/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 7, 15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 6, 9</a>). The Revelation is begun (vers. 17-20) and ended (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>) by Christ himself; but the main portion is conducted "by means of his angel." Thus St. Paul says of the Law that it was "administered by means of angels in the hand of a mediator," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Moses (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). In this case the mediator is John, a "servant" specially selected for this work (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Thus we have four gradations - the primary Agent, the Father; the secondary Agent, Jesus Christ; the instrument, his angel; the recipient, John. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Who bare record. "To bear witness" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) and "witness," or "testimony" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), are characteristic of St. John's writings, and serve to connect together his Gospel, the First Epistle, and the Apocalypse. Such words should be carefully noted, and, so far as possible, uniformly translated, in order to mark their frequency in the English Version. The Authorized Version rings the changes on "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," and "testify," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; and on "witness," "record," and "testimony," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The Revised Version has here made great improvements. To bear witness to the truth and the Word of God was St. John's special function throughout his long life, and to this fact he calls attention in all his chief writings (see Haupt on <a href="../../par/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The testimony of Jesus Christ</span>, like "the Revelation of Jesus Christ" (ver. 1), means that which he gave, not that which tells about him. <span class="cmt_word">And of all things that he saw</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">even of all things that he saw</span>, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in apposition with what precedes. The seer is here speaking of the visions of the Apocalypse, not of the events in Christ's life. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, are rightly compared to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of Thucydides (1:1; 6:7, 93). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>is</i> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time <i>is</i> at hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that readeth</span> this book publicly in the church, and <span class="cmt_word">they that hear</span> the book read, are equally blessed. There is grace promised to both minister and congregation who live up to the spirit of the Scriptures. St. John here suggests that a usage common in the Jewish Church (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>) may be adopted in the Christian Church. Probably this verse is the earliest authority for the public reading of the New Testament Scripture. It is very precarious to argue that "the Apocalypse, which points to this custom, cannot have been composed in the year 68," because this Christian custom is of later origin than 68. The official communications of apostles were sure to be read publicly in the churches (see Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). Until the new lectionary came into use, the blessing here promised to the liturgical use of the Apocalypse was sadly neglected in the English Church. One might almost have supposed that a blessing had been pronounced on those who do <span class="accented">not</span> read and do <span class="accented">not</span> hear the prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this prophecy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of the prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the prophecy of this book" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7, 18</a>). That which is a revelation in reference to Christ is a prophecy in reference to John. "Prophecy" must not be narrowed down to the vulgar meaning of <span class="accented">fore</span>telling future events; it is the <span class="accented">forth</span>telling of the mind of God. Prophecy, in the narrow sense of prediction, cannot well be <span class="accented">kept.</span> It is God's call to repentance, obedience, steadfastness, and prayer that must be kept by both reader and hearers in order to bring a blessing. And if the words are to be kept, they can be understood. We have no right to set aside the Revelation as an insoluble puzzle (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>, where, however, we have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The time is at hand</span>. The appointed time, the season foreordained of God (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is near. We may ask, with F.D. Maurice, "Did not the original writer use words in their simple, natural sense? If he told the hearers and readers of his day that <span class="accented">the time</span> was <span class="accented">at hand</span>, did he not mean them to understand that it <span class="accented">was</span> at hand?" No doubt. But that does not preclude us from interpreting the inspired words as referring, not only to events near St. John's time, but also to other events of which they were the foretastes and figures. To us the meaning is that the type of the end has been foretold and has come, and the end itself, which has been equally foretold, must be watched for in all seriousness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">address and greeting.</span> Of this section only vers. 4-6 are, strictly speaking, the salutation; vers. 7, 8 constitute a kind of summary, or prelude - ver. 7 being more closely connected with what precedes, ver. 8 with what follows. The salutation proper (vers. 4-6) should be compared with the salutations in St. Paul's Epistles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John</span>. Evidently some well-known John, otherwise some designation would be necessary. Would any but the apostle have thus written to the Churches of Asia? St. Paul had some need to insist upon his being an apostle; St. John lind none. <span class="cmt_word">To the seven Churches</span>. From the earliest times it has been pointed out that the number seven here is not exact, but symbolical; it does exclude other Churches, but symbolizes all. Thus the Muratorian Fragment: "John in the Apocalypse, though he wrote to the seven Churches, yet speaks to all." Augustine: "By the seven is signified the perfection of the universal Church, and by writing to seven he shows the fulness of the one." So also Bede: "Through these seven Churches he writes to every Church; for by the number seven is denoted universality, as the whole period of the world revolves on seven days;" and he points out that St. Paul also wrote to seven Churches. Compare the seven pillars of the house of wisdom (<a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>), the seven deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>), the seven gifts of the Spirit. The number seven appears repeatedly in the Apocalypse; and that it is arbitrary and symbolical is shown by the fact that there were other Churches besides these seven - Colossae, Hierapolis, Tralles, Magnesia, Miletus. The repeated formula, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches," proves that the praise and blame distributed among the seven are of universal application. <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span> means the Roman proconsular province of Asia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the western part of Asia Minor (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace</span> be unto you, and peace. This combination occurs in the salutations of St. Peter and St. Paul. It unites Greek and Hebrew elements, and gives both a Christian fulness of meaning. <span class="cmt_word">From him which is</span>. Why should not we be as bold as St. John, and disregard grammar for the sake of keeping the Divine Name intact? St. John writes, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> "If in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> the words may run, 'I AM hath sent me unto you,' may we not also be allowed to read here, 'from HE THAT IS, AND THAT WAS, AND THAT IS TO COME'?" (Lightfoot, 'On Revision,' p. 133). Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> to represent the nominative of the past participle of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not exist, and with the whole expression compare "The same yesterday, and today, and forever" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Here every clause applies to the Father, not one to each Person; the three Persons are marked by the three prepositions, "from ... and from ... and from." It is a mistake to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> either of the mission of the Comforter or of the second advent. <span class="cmt_word">The seven Spirits</span>. The Holy Spirit, sevenfold in his operations (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>). They are <span class="cmt_word">before his throne</span>, ever ready for a mission from him (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). The number seven once more symbolizes universality, plenitude, and perfection; that unity amidst variety which marks the work of the Spirit and the sphere of it, the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And from Jesus Christ, <i>who is</i> the faithful witness, <i>and</i> the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

This was his function - "to bear witness unto the truth" (<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). The rainbow is called "the faithful witness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Firstborn of the dead</span>. Christ was the first who was born to eternal life after the death which ends this life (see Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>). "The ruler of this world" offered Jesus the glory of the kingdoms of the world, if he would worship him. He won a higher glory by dying to conquer him, and thus the crucified Peasant became the Lord of Roman emperors, "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." The grammar of this verse is irregular; "the faithful Witness," etc., in the nominative being in apposition with "Jesus Christ" in the genitive (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto him that loved us</span>. The true reading gives "that <span class="accented">loveth</span> us" unceasingly. The supreme act of dying for us did not exhaust his love. In what follows it is difficult to decide between "washed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) and "loosed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), both readings being very well supported; but we should certainly omit "own" before "blood." The blood of Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin is a frequent thought with the apostle who witnessed the piercing of the side (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6-8</a>).

"Kingdom," not "kings," is the right reading. Christians are nowhere said to be kings. Collectively they are a kingdom - "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), or, as St. Peter, following the LXX., gives it, "a royal priesthood" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

In the simple majesty of its solemn language it reminds us of the opening of St. John's Gospel and of his First Epistle. "I am <span class="accented">the</span> Alpha and <span class="accented">the</span> Omega" is here not followed by "the Beginning and the End," which the Vulgate and some other authorities insert from <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a> and Revelation 22:13. Who is "the Lord," that utters these words? Surely the Christ, as seems clear from ver. 17; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>. To attribute them to the Father robs the words of their special appropriateness in this context, where they form a prelude to "the Revelation <span class="accented">of Jesus Christ"</span> as God and as the Almighty "Ruler of the kings of the earth." Yet the fact that similar language is also used of the Father (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) shows how clearly St. John teaches that Jesus Christ is "equal to the Father as touching his Godhead." These sublime attributes are applicable to each. Like the doxology (see on ver. 6), the statement of these Divine attributes increases in fulness as the writing proceeds. Here "the Alpha and the Omega;" ver. 17 and <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>, "the First and the Last;" in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End;" in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." Of these four, the second and fourth certainly apply to the Son, and the third certainly to the Father, the first probably to the Son. <span class="cmt_word">The Almighty</span>. With the exception of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>, where it occurs in a quotation, this expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) is in the New Testament peculiar to the Apocalypse, where it occurs nine times.

Bengel notes that it is in tribulation that believers specially love this book. The Church of Asia, particularly after the prosperous time of Constantine, had a low opinion of the Apocalypse; while the African Church, which was more subject to persecution, highly esteemed it. "Everything tends to show that the Apocalypse was acknowledged in Africa from the earliest times as canonical Scripture" (Westcott, 'On the Canon of the New Testament,' p. 238). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the isle</span>.

St. John does not assume that his readers know so insignificant a place. He does not say simply "in Patmos," as St. Luke says "to Rhodes" or "to Cyprus," but "in <span class="accented">the isle</span> that is <span class="accented">called</span> Patmos." Now <span class="accented">Patmo</span> or <span class="accented">Patino</span>, but in the Middle Ages <span class="accented">Palmosa.</span> Its small size and rugged character made it a suitable place for penal transportation. Banishment to a small island (<span class="accented">deportatio in insulam</span> or <span class="accented">insulae vinculum</span>) was common. "Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum" (Juv., 1:73). Compare the cases of Agrippa Postumus (Tac., 'Ann.,' 1:3) and of Julia (4:71). For a full account of the island, see Gudrin's 'Description de File de Patmos,' Paris: 1856. For the circumstances of St. John's banishment, see Introduction. It was in exile that Jacob saw God at Bethel; in exile that Moses saw God at the burning bush; in exile that Elijah heard the "still small voice;" in exile that Ezekiel saw "the likeness of the glory of the Lord" by the river Chebar; in exile that Daniel saw "the Ancient of days." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus</span>.

This is, therefore, the earliest use of the phrase in this sense. That it means Easter Day or Pentecost is baseless conjecture. The phrase had not yet become common in A.D. , as is shown from St. Paul writing, "on the first of the week" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>), the usual expression in the Gospels and Acts (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>).

"No longer observing sabbaths, but fashioning their lives after the Lord's day" (Ign., 'Magn.,' 9.). Melito, Bishop of Sardis (A.D. 170), wrote a treatise <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (Eusebius, 'Hist.

Comp. also Clem.

The voice is evidently Christ's; but throughout the Apocalypse the speaker is frequently not named. By a construction common in Hebrew, "saying" agrees with "trumpet," the nearest substantive, instead of with "voice" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).

Over and over again, twelve times in all, St. John reminds us that he writes this book by Divine command (ver. 19; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1, 7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The seven Churches</span>. The order is not haphazard. It is precisely that which would be natural to a person writing in Patmos or travelling from Ephesus. Ephesus comes first as metropolis; then the city on the coast, Smyrna; then the inland cities in order, working round towards Ephesus again. In short, it is just the order in which St. John would visit the Churches in making an apostolic circuit as metropolitan. With the exception of what is told us in these chapters, the history of the Churches of Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis in the apostolic or sub-apostolic age is quite unknown. It was an ancient objection to the Apocalypse that in Thyatira there was no Church (see on Revelation 2:18).

As in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>, "the voice" is put for the speaker. This is the right method in studying the Revelation; we must, like St. John, "turn to see the voice." We must look, not to the events about which it seems to us to speak, but to him who utters it. The book is "the Revelation," not of the secrets of history, but "of Jesus Christ." Seven golden candlesticks. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>; and seven times in this book.

It is by no means certain that a similar figure is not meant here; the seven-branched candlestick familiar to all who know the Arch of Titus. If the Christ stood "in the midst of the candlesticks," his form would appear as that which united the seven branches. But it is perhaps more natural to understand seven separate lamp stands, each with its own lamp; and these, in contrast with the seven-branched stand of the temple, may represent the elastic multiplicity of the Christian Churches throughout the world in contrast with the rigid unity of the Jewish Church of Jerusalem.

It is not certain that the absence of the articles forbids us to render the phrase, "the Son of man;" but it is safer to render, "a son of man." The glorified Messiah still wears that human form by which the beloved disciple had known him before the Ascension (<a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). With the exception of <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>, the full form, "the Son of man," is used only by the Christ of himself. <span class="cmt_word">A garment down to the feet.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">vestis talaris</span>), though frequent in the LXX.

The Rhemish renders it "a <span class="accented">priestly</span> garment down to the foote." Compare Joseph's "coat of many colours," which literally means a "coat reaching to the extremities." In <a href="../../par/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a> "the robe of the ephod" of the high priest is <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The angel in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5, 6</a> is described in similar language: "whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a>, "I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand"). "Enough is said to indicate that the Son of man claims and fulfils the office which was assigned to the children of Aaron; that he blesses the people in God's Name; that he stands as their Representative before his Father" (F.D. Maurice). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">His head and <i>his</i> hairs <i>were</i> white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <i>were</i> as a flame of fire;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His head</span>. From the garments of the great High Priest, St. John passes on to himself. What he had seen as a momentary foretaste of glory at the Transfiguration, he sees now as the abiding condition of the Christ. In <a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a> "the Ancient of days" has "the hair of his head like pure wool." This snowy whiteness is partly the brightness of heavenly glory, partly the majesty of the hoary head. The Christ appears to St. John as a son of man, but also as a "Divine Person invested with the attributes of eternity." <span class="cmt_word">As a flame of fire</span>. "The Lord thy God is a consuming fire" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). "I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). The flame purifies the conscience and kindles the affections. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fine brass</span>. This may stand as a translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a word which occurs here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a> only, and the second half of which has never been satisfactorily explained. It may have been a local technical term in use among the metalworkers of Ephesus (<a href="../../par/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-14.htm">2 Timothy 4:14</a>). The Rhemish Version renders it "latten." In what follows, the Revised Version is to be preferred: "as if <span class="accented">it had been refined</span> in a furnace; and his voice as the <span class="accented">voice</span> of many waters." It is tempting to think that "the roar of the sea is in the ears of the lonely man in Patmos;" but the image seems rather to be that of the sound of many cataracts (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>). There is singularly little of the scenery of Patmos in the Apocalypse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <i>was</i> as the sun shineth in his strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - He holds the Churches in his hand as a precious possession, which he sustains as a glory to himself. These Churches are as planets, which shine, not with their own light, but that of the sun; which shine most brightly in the night of "tribulation," which (like him who holds them in his right hand) are a guide to the wanderer, and are ever moving, yet ever at rest. <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword</span>. This metaphor runs through both Old and New Testaments. It is frequent in this book (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15, 21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, etc.). The sharp words of men and the searching words of God are both spoken of under this figure of the sword. Tertullian and Richard of St. Victor explain the two edges as the Law and the Gospel. Other still more fanciful explanations have been given. "Two-edged" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is literally "two-mouthed," and perhaps expresses no more than the thorough efficiency of the sword. It occurs in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; also in classical Greek as equivalent to the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. If a double meaning be insisted on, it may be found in the double character of God's Word, which not only smites the wicked, but searches the good; which cuts sometimes to punish, sometimes to heal. Thus in these very epistles to the Churches, penetrating words both of blessing and condemnation are uttered. The word for "sword" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs six times in Revelation; elsewhere in the New Testament only <a href="../../par/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>. In classical Greek it is the heavy Thracian broadsword. In the LXX. it is used of the "flaming sword" of the cherubim which kept the way of the tree of life (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); also of the sword of Goliath (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>:25). <span class="cmt_word">His countenance was as the sun shineth</span>. It is the "Sun of Righteousness" and "the Light of the world." The exceptional glory of the Transfiguration has become constant now. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I fell at his feet as dead</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as one dead - as a dead man.</span> St. Peter had fallen at Jesus' feet when he became conscious of the ineffable difference between sinlessness and sinfulness (<a href="../../par/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>). How much more, therefore, would consciousness of the glorified Christ overwhelm St. John! Long years of contemplation of the incarnate Son would not prevent that. In like manner, Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17, 27</a>), and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>) are affected by the Divine presence. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not</span>. Thus Christ encouraged the terrified apostles on the lake (<a href="../../par/john/6-20.htm">John 6:20</a>) and at the Transfiguration. So also the angel cheered Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>), Zacharias (<a href="../../par/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), Mary (<a href="../../par/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), the shepherds (<a href="../../par/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>), and the women at the sepulchre (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>I am</i> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am he that liveth</span>. This should be joined with what precedes. "I am the First and the Last, and <span class="accented">the Living One</span>; and I <span class="accented">became</span> dead, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of <span class="accented">death and of Hades."</span> "Became" or "came to be" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), as in vers. 9 and 10, indicates an exceptional condition. The "Amen" has been improperly inserted after "forevermore" (see on "forever and ever," in ver. 6) from liturgical usage. Most English versions omit it. The keys, as so often, are the sign of authority (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>). Christ, as the absolutely Living One, who "has life in himself" and is the Source of life in others, has control, not merely over the passage from this world to the other, but over the other world itself. He can recall departed souls from their resting place. The error of rendering <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "hell" has often been pointed out; it is not a place of punishment, but the temporary home of the departed, who are awaiting the day of judgment. "Death," in all the best manuscripts and versions precedes "Hades;" and this is the logical order. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write the things</span>. The true reading and most English Versions give, "write <span class="accented">therefore</span> the things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because thou hast seen me and received thy commission from me. The omission of "therefore" comes from the Genevan Version. The threefold division of things probably refers to past, present, and future <span class="accented">visions</span>, not to the past, present, and future in history. But it is possible that "the things which thou sawest" refers to the visions, and "the things which are," etc., to the realities symbolized in the visions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mystery</span>. In construction this is the accusative after "write." A mystery is the opposite of a revealed truth; it is a sacred truth kept secret, the inner meaning of something which is perceived, but not generally understood. <span class="cmt_word">The angels of the seven Churches</span>. The meaning of these "angels" has been very much disputed. The common explanation that they are the bishops of the Churches is attractive on account of its simplicity. But it has very grave difficulties, especially for those who assign the Apocalypse to the earlier date of A.D. . It is highly improbable that at that very early time the seven Churches were already so fully organized as each to possess its own bishop. And granting that they were, and that the bishops might fitly be called "angels" or "messengers," would they not be called messengers of God or of Christ, rather than messengers of the Churches"? And would not the primitive Church have preserved this title as a synonym for "bishop"? "St. John's own language gives the true key to the symbolism. 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven Churches.' This contrast between the heavenly and the earthly fires - the star shining steadily by its own inherent eternal light, and the lamp flickering and uncertain, requiring to be fed with fuel and tended with care - cannot be devoid of meaning. The star is the suprasensual counterpart, the heavenly representative; the lamp, the earthly realization, the outward embodiment. Whether the angel is here conceived as an actual person, the celestial guardian, or only as a personification, the idea or spirit of the Church, it is unnecessary for my present purpose to consider. But whatever may be the exact conception, he is identified with and made responsible for the Church to a degree wholly unsuited to any human officer. Nothing is predicated of him which may not be predicated of it. To him are imputed all its hopes, its fears, its graces, its shortcomings, he is punished with it, and he is rewarded with it ... Nor is this mode of representation new. The 'princes' in Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20, 21</a>) present a very near if not an exact parallel to the angels of the Revelation" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Philippians,' p. 198). The identification of the angel of each Church with the Church itself is shown in a marked way by the fact that, although each epistle is addressed to the angel, yet the constantly recurring refrain is, "Hear what the Spirit saith <span class="accented">to the Churches,"</span> not "to the <span class="accented">angels</span> of the Churches." The angel and the Church are the same under different aspects: the one is its spiritual character personified; the other is the congregation of believers who collectively possess this character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jude/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jude 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jude 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
