There is no good ground for supposing, as some do, that, after the events narrated in <a href="../../par/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>, an interval occurred in the visions, during which St. John possibly wrote down the matter contained in the first three chapters. Nor is there any justification for assigning what follows to a time after this world. It would be pressing <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> very far to make it apply to these present things of the world; and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> certainly need not mean "the things after this world." The expression is used here in its ordinary, natural sense: "After having seen this, I saw," etc.; introducing some new phase or variety of spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">I looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">I saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). No fresh act of <span class="accented">looking</span> is signified. <span class="accented">I saw in</span> the Spirit, as formerly (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a door;</span> or, <span class="accented">and, behold, a door, and the first voice.</span> Such is the construction of the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Was opened in heaven</span>; or, <span class="accented">an open door, in heaven.</span> St. John did not see the action of opening the door, but he saw a door which had been set open, through which he might gaze, and observe what passed within. Alford contrasts <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>, where "the heaven was opened;" and supposes that the seer is transported through the open door into heaven, from which position he sees heaven, and views all that happens on the earth. Victorinus aptly compares the <span class="accented">open door</span> to the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me</span>. Omit the "was" which follows, as well as the colon which precedes, and repeat "a voice," as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">And, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which 1 heard, the voice which was, as it were, of a trumpet.</span> The voice signified is not the <span class="accented">first</span>, but the <span class="accented">former</span> voice; viz. that already heard and described in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. The possessor of the voice is not indicated. Stier ('Reden Jesu') attributes the voice to Christ; but it seems rather that of an angel, or at any rate not that of Christ, whose voice in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> is described as "of many waters, "not as" of a trumpet." <span class="cmt_word">Which said</span>. The voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) becomes masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Though <span class="accented">whose</span> voice is not stated, yet the vividness and reality of the vision causes the writer to speak of the <span class="accented">voice</span> as the personal being whom it signifies. Come up hither. That is in the Spirit - for the apostle "immediately was in the Spirit" (ver. 2). He was to receive a yet higher insight into spiritual things (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, where St. Paul was "caught up into the third heaven"). <span class="cmt_word">And I will show thee</span>. It is not necessary, with Stier (see above on ver. 1), to infer that these words are Christ's. Though from him all the revelation comes, he may well use the ministry of angels through whom to signify his will. <span class="cmt_word">Things which must be hereafter</span>; or, <span class="accented">the things which must happen hereafter.</span> The things which it is right should happen, and which, therefore, must needs happen (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). "Hereafter" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as before in ver. 1, but in a somewhat more general and less definite sense - at <span class="accented">some time after this</span>; but when precisely is not stated. The full stop may possibly be better placed before "hereafter;" in which case "hereafter" would introduce the following phrase, exactly as before in this verse. There is no "and;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, though in the Textus Receptus, is omitted in the best manuscripts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <i>one</i> sat on the throne.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And immediately I was in the Spirit</span>. Omit "and" (see above), so that the passage may be rendered, <span class="accented">After these things, immediately, I was in the Spirit</span>; a new scene was opened out, as before (in ver. 1). St. John was already <span class="accented">in the Spirit</span>; but now receives a fresh outpouring of grace, enabling him to see yet more deeply into the mysteries of the kingdom of God. And, behold, a throne was set in heaven; or, <span class="accented">a throne was situated</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). There is no action of placing or setting up. Compare the vision of Ezekiel, "In the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>), where the throne appears above the cherubim, in the position of the cloud of glory (cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a>, where the seraphim are above). <span class="cmt_word">And one sat on the throne.</span> Probably the Triune God, to whom the Trisagien in ver. 8 is addressed. Some have thought that the Father is indicated, in contradistinction to the other Persons of the Holy Trinity, and that it is from him that the Son takes the book in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>. But as Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "The Son as Man may well be said, especially in a sublime vision like this, to come to God." The Person is not named, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Name of God is incommunicable; it is the "new Name" (see on Revelation 3:12); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the seer describes only what is seen; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is suppressed from a sense of reverence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and <i>there was</i> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat was to look upon like</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">he that sat like in appearance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is found in this verse and in two other places only in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> (where it is part of a quotation from Joel) and in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>. In the latter place the expression is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the presence of the preposition, together with the article, seems to justify the rendering "in the vision." In the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is frequently used to signify either "vision" or "appearance" (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a> and Daniel 8:1; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>; and many others, where it is "vision." Also <a href="../../par/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>; and many others, where it is "appearance"). In the classics, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> signifies a "vision;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "sight," the power of seeing. <span class="cmt_word">A jasper and a sardine stone</span>. The <span class="accented">jasper</span> was the last, and the <span class="accented">sardius</span> the first stone of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>). The jasper was the first, and the sardius the sixth of the foundations of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19, 20</a>). Much doubt is attached to the whole subject of the precious stones of the Bible. The modern jasper is opaque, while it is evident that the jasper of the Revelation is remarkable for its translucent character (see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, "jasper stone. clear as crystal;" 21:18, "The building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass"). It is evident that the stone was characterized by purity and brilliancy - features which seem to point it out as the modern diamond. The varying colour, which, according to some authorities, the jasper possessed, is not inconsistent with this view. It is curious, too, that in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered "diamond," is represented in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; while in ver. 20, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> the English "jasper," is <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">sardius</span> was the carnelian, always red, though somewhat varying in shade. The name has been variously derived from <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Persian <span class="accented">sered</span>, yellowish red; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Sardis, as the first place of its discovery; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while carnelian is connected with <span class="accented">carneus</span>, as being of the colour of raw flesh. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Skeat derives the word from <span class="accented">cornu</span>, a horn; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the term being thus an allusion to the semitransparent nature of the stone. The pure jasper, together with the red sardius, may fitly typify God's purity and mercy together with his justice and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a rainbow round about the throne.</span> The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ca;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is used here, is not found in the LXX.? where <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is invariably found, probably to avoid reference to a term which was so pre-eminently heathen. The rainbow is here, as always (see <a href="../../par/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12, 13</a>), a token of God's faithfulness in keeping his promises. It is, therefore, a fit sign of comfort to those persecuted Christians to whom, and for whose edification, this message was sent. In sight like unto an emerald. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is our modern green emerald. It was highly valued in Roman times. It was one of the stones of the high priest's breastplate, and the fourth foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>). The description in this verse recalls <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a>, "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain. so was the appearance of the brightness round about." Some have found a difficulty in the association of a rainbow with its varied colours, and the single green hue of the emerald. But of course it is the form only of the rainbow which is alluded to, not every quality which a rainbow may possess. A circular green appearance was seen round the throne, which perhaps may be described as a green halo. If the purity of the jasper (see above) be allowed to symbolize God's purity and spirituality, and the sardine, man clothed with flesh, the green emerald may fitly represent God's goodness displayed in nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">And round about the throne <i>were</i> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats</span>. Throughout the vision no past tense is used. The vision represents the worship of heaven (so far as it can be presented to human understanding) as it continues eternally. <span class="accented">Thrones.. seats.</span> Render both by the same English word, as in the Revised Version. Some doubt is attached to the case of the first <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is found in B, P; and this makes the construction nominative after <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> (cf. ver. 2); but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 34, 35, read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, which causes <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to be understood. The point is immaterial, as the meaning is the same. <span class="cmt_word">And upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting</span>. Omit "I saw" (see above). The number twenty-four, the double of twelve, represents the Churches of both the old and the new covenants. The elders are the heads or representatives of the body to which they belong (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, and many others; see also the list of <span class="accented">elders</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.). In the Christian Church the same distinction exists (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, "ordained them <span class="accented">elders</span>;" <a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>, St. Paul sent for <span class="accented">the elders</span> of Ephesus; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>, "The elders were present"). So here the <span class="accented">elders</span> represent the saints of both the Old and New Testaments. Thus they offer "the prayers of the saints" (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). Christ, moreover, promised twelve thrones to his disciples (<a href="../../par/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>) though not to the exclusion of the saints of old, for both are conjoined in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14</a>. In <a href="../../par/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2, 3</a>, the victorious ones sing "the song of <span class="accented">Moses</span> and of the <span class="accented">Lamb."</span> Other interpretations which have been advanced are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the twenty-four elders represent the great and minor prophets (St. Hippolytus); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> higher angels - the celestial priesthood, as denoted by their white garments and the number twenty-four, the number of courses of the Levitical priesthood (Reuss); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply angels (Hoffmann); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the elders of the Church at Jerusalem (Grotius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the doubled twelve signifies the accession of the Gentiles (Bleek, De Wette); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the books of the Old Testament. then the Jewish Church, while the four living creatures denote the Gospels, that is, the Christian Church (Wordsworth). (For this last view, for which there is much to be said, see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) Clothed in white raiment; the natural garb of heaven, symbolical of purify. And they had on their heads crowns of gold (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). The crown of victory, not necessarily the kingly crown. Possibly a reference to the priestly crown (see on Revelation 2:10). Trench and Vaughan, however, are of opinion that the crowns here denote the kingly condition of the saints. But Christians are nowhere in the New Testament described as "kings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <i>there were</i> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thundering and voices. The <span class="accented">present</span> tense (see on ver. 4). The whole symbolical of the power and majesty of God, as of old he manifested his presence on Sinai. "There were thunders and lightnings and...  the voice of the trumpet" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. The Holy Spirit, represented in his sevenfold operation, by lamps, which illumine. The same idea is expressed under another figure in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>, where the searching, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit is typified by <span class="accented">seven eyes.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And before the throne <i>there was</i> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <i>were</i> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. <span class="accented">Sea of glass</span>, or <span class="accented">a glassy sea.</span> The quality of "glassiness" may refer to the pure <span class="accented">appearance</span> of the sea; or it may mean that the sea was in consistency like unto glass; that is, solid and unyielding, so that there was nothing strange in the fact that it supported weights. In either case, the notion is repeated by parallelism in the next clause, "like unto crystal." But the glassy sea may mean "a glass laver," and bear no reference to what is usually called a sea. The brazen laver is described (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>) as a "molten sea." St. John may therefore mean that before the throne of God was a laver of the purest material, just as the brazen laver was before the temple. One difficulty here presents itself, viz. that there would be no use for a laver in heaven, where all is pure, and the figure therefore appears a little incongruous. But as it stood <span class="accented">before</span> the throne, where all who came would have to pass by, it may fitly typify the waters of Baptism, passed by all Christians; and the figure would be aptly suggested to St. John by the furniture of the temple to which he has such constant allusions. <span class="cmt_word">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne</span>. This may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, the throne being rectangular, the four living beings were in the middle of each side of the parallelogram; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> while one was in front of the throne, the other three formed a semicircle round it, one being directly behind, and two towards the ends. <span class="cmt_word">Were four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">or, four living creatures</span> (Revised Version); or, better still, <span class="accented">four living beings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>). The "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-7.htm">Revelation 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc., must not be confounded with the "living ones" of this passage. The one quality connoted by the term here used is the possession of life. The question of the precise meaning and interpretation of the vision of "the living beings" is a difficult one, and much has been written concerning it. The vision is evidently connected with the appearances described in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10, and which are called in Isaiah "seraphim," in Ezekiel "cherubim." We are led, therefore, to inquire what mental ideas were pictured to the Jews under the symbolical forms of cherubim and seraphim. Cheyne shows ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 272) that the name <span class="accented">cherub</span> is probably connected with <span class="accented">kirubu</span>, the winged ox god of the Assyrians, and with <span class="accented">kurubu</span>, the vulture or eagle (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the guardians of the treasures of the gods); and he infers that among heathen nations the mythic cherubim denote the cloud-masses which appear to guard the portals of the sky, and on which the sun-god issues at break of day. With regard to the seraphim, he compares the name of the fiery serpents(<span class="accented">s'rafim</span>) of <a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, and concludes that the term was symbolical of the lightning, the weapon of the gods. Now, in Old Testament passages the cherubim and seraphim are always pictured as the attendants of God, and the workers of his purposes and judgments - an idea which may readily have been assimilated by the Jews from the conceptions of their heathen neighbours. Thus cherubim with the flaming sword are placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); Jehovah rode upon a cherub, and did fly (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>); he communes with his people from between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); he is the Shepherd of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>); the temple in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> is adorned with cherubim, as being the dwelling-place of God; they are the attendants of the glory of God in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22-28</a>; and the seraphim fill an analogous position (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). We may therefore infer that the appearance of the "living beings" implied the presence of some order of beings in attendance upon God, the workers of his will, and the manifestation of his glory. Again, the term used (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>) and the characteristics of the appearance naturally and almost irresistibly lead us to interpret the form as one symbolical of <span class="accented">life.</span> The human face, the ox as the representative of domestic, and the lion of wild animals, and the eagle among birds, appear to be typical of the four most conspicuous orders of animal life. The ceaseless movements described in ver. 8 portray the same idea. The four living beings draw attention to the woes heaped upon created life (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote never-resting activity. We may therefore believe that the living beings are symbolical of all creation fulfilling its proper office - waiting upon God, fulfilling his will, and setting forth his glory. It is noteworthy that the human face, as distinct from the Church, which is represented by the four and twenty elders, appears to indicate the power of God to use, for his purposes and his glory, that part of mankind which has not been received into the Church - the part which constitutes the "other sheep, not of this fold" (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). These representatives of created life worship God, and give (ver. 11), as a reason for ascribing glory and honour to him, the circumstance that "thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created." The following are other interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The living beings represent the four Gospels. This view is held by many ancient writers, though there are many variations in assigning to each Gospel its own representative. Victorinus considers the <span class="accented">man</span> to be a type of St. Matthew, who sets forth prominently the human nature of our Lord; the kingly <span class="accented">lion</span> is referred to St. Mark; the sacrificial ox to St. Luke; the aspiring <span class="accented">eagle</span> to St. John. Amongst the supporters of this interpretation (though varying in the precise applicability) are St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Athanasius, St. Irenaeus, St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, Andreas, Primasius, Bede, I. Williams, Wordsworth (for a lull exposition of this view, see <span class="accented">Wordsworth, in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The four great apostles: St. Peter, the lion; James the brother of the Lord, the ox; St. Matthew, the man; St. Paul, the eagle (Grotius). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Church of the New Testament; as the Church of the Old Testament was represented by the standards or four tribes (see <a href="../../par/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), on which these devices were emblazoned according to tradition (Mede). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The four patriarchal Churches: the <span class="accented">man</span>, Alexandria, famed for learning; <span class="accented">the lion</span>, Jerusalem, <span class="accented">"propter</span> constantiam" (<a href="../../par/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>); the <span class="accented">ox</span>, Antioch, as "parata obedire mandatis apostolorum;" the <span class="accented">eagle</span>, Constantinople, remarkable for men "per contemplationem elevati, ut Grog. Naz." (De Lyra and a Lapide). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The four cardinal virtues (Arethas). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The four elements (the 'Catena,' p. 246) - a view not materially differing from that first set forth above, bearing in mind the idea of the ancients that all creation was formed from the four elements. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The four motive powers of the human soul: reason, anger, desire, conscience (a Lapide, quoting Grog. Naz.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The doctors of the Church (Vitringa). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(9)</span> Four attributes of our Lord: his humanity, sacrificial life, his kingly nature, his perfect and spiritual nature soaring beyond all other men (Arethas-Cramer, p. 245). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(10)</span> The four orders: pastoral, diaconal, doctoral, contemplative, (Joachim). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(11)</span> The four principal angels (a Lapide). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(12)</span> Four apostolic virtues (Alcasar). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(13)</span> The attributes of divinity: wisdom, power, omniscience, creation (Renan). <span class="cmt_word">Full of eyes before and behind.</span> From <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 3</a> the idea of six wings is borrowed, and also the "Holy, holy, holy" from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 6</a>; the <span class="accented">four figures and four faces</span> (which are united in Ezekiel, but made separate in the Revelation); and from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a> the body <span class="accented">full of eyes.</span> The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote unceasing activity. If the four living beings all faced towards the throne while standing on each side of it, St. John would see them in various positions, and observe the back as well as the front. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the first beast <i>was</i> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast <i>was</i> like a flying eagle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</span> (Upon "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), see on ver. 6. For the signification, see also above on ver. 6.) Whether there was any difference in the forms as a whole, or whether the difference consisted chiefly or solely in the thee, cannot be certainly known. Each being is symbolical of some class or some quality of which it is representative. (For the application, see on ver. 6.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <i>him</i>; and <i>they were</i> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within.</span> The stop should probably be after wings: <span class="accented">are full of eyes about and within.</span> In <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> we have "six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." These actions appear to indicate reverence, humility, obedience. The eyes denote ceaseless activity. And they rest not day and night, saying. In the Authorized Version "day and night" is attached to "rest not." but probably should be taken with "saying," for, if connected with the negative phrase, "nor" would be more likely to occur than "and." But the point is practically immaterial, since the sense of the passage is the same in both readings. These representatives of <span class="accented">life</span> display the characteristics of life in its fullest energy. They have no part in anything which savours of death - no stillness, rest, or sleep. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy.</span> The thrice-repeated "holy" has very generally been held to indicate the Trinity of the Godhead. Such is evidently the intention of the English Church in ordering this passage to be read in the Epistle for Trinity Sunday. This ascription of praise is often, though wrongly, spoken of as the "Trisagion." <span class="cmt_word">Lord God Almighty</span>. "Almighty" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, the "All-Ruler," not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "All-Powerful." The former, as Bishop Pearson says, embraces the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which was, and is, and is to come.</span> This phrase is no doubt intended to attribute to God the quality of eternal existence. But it may also symbolize three aspects or departments of God's dealings with mankind: the <span class="accented">creation</span>, which has been effected by the Father; the <span class="accented">redemption</span>, which is now occurring by the intercession of the Son; and the final perfect <span class="accented">sanctification</span> by the Holy Ghost.

The Eucharistic hymn recognizes the glory and honour which are the inseparable attributes of God, and renders the thanks due to him from his creation. To him that sat on the throne, who liveth forever and ever; or, <span class="accented">to him sitting on the throne.</span> The Triune God (see on ver. 2). "Who liveth forever and ever" declares that attribute which was ascribed to God, in the song of the living beings, by the words, "which was, and is, and is to come" (see on ver. 8). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth forever and ever</span>. <span class="accented">Shall fall</span>, etc. The tenses are all future except the present "sitteth" and "liveth." The four and twenty elders are the representatives of the universal Church (see on ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">And cast their crowns before the throne, saying.</span> Their <span class="accented">crowns</span> of victory, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (see on Revelation 2:10 and Revelation 4:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art worthy, O Lord</span>; or, <span class="accented">thou art worthy, our Lord and our God.</span> In 13, the Syriac, Andreas, Arethas, Theodore-Stud., Arm., and many others, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the holy one," is added. <span class="cmt_word">To receive glory and honour and power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.). The presence of the article either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> denotes universality, and the expression is thus equivalent to "all glory," "all honour," "all power; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> refers to the glory and honour mentioned in ver. 9. The former view seems more probable (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>). The Church is represented as ascribing to God all power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); that power which he exercises in its fulness in heaven, and which, though partially abrogated on earth, he will nevertheless again take up, as foretold in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>. For thou hast created all things; or, <span class="accented">for thou didst create all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">- the universe.</span> The representatives of creation thank God for their existence; the Church sees in his creation reason to ascribe power to him. Thus the reason for the doxology is given - "because thou didst create." And for thy pleasure; much better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and because of thy will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). When God willed it, the universe had no existence; again, when he willed it, the universe came into being. <span class="cmt_word">They are, and were created</span>; or, <span class="accented">they were, and were created</span> (Revised Version). There are three variations in the reading of this passage: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> al40 fere Vulgate, Coptic, Syriac, Arethas, Primasius (in another version), anon-Augustine, Haymo; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> is read in S, P, 1, 7, 35, 49, 79, 87, 91, <span class="accented">et al.</span> et Andreas; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in B, 14, 38, 51. "They were" signifies "they existed," whereas before they were not in existence; "and were created" points to the manner of coming into existence and the Person to whom this existence was due. If <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> be read, the meaning is the same. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> would simplify the sentence very much. It would then run: <span class="accented">For thy pleasure</span>, or, <span class="accented">At thy will they were not existent, and again, at thy will they were created.</span> But the weight of authority is against this reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
