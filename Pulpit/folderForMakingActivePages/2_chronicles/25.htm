This affix to the mother's name may perhaps carry credit to the memory of Jehoiada, for having been careful to select a woman of the honoured city rather than of any provincial or even less worthy city. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not with a perfect heart</span>. This is illustrated by his coming "to set up the gods of Edom" (vers. 14-16, 20); also by what the parallel supplies, that he resembled Joash rather than David, and did not suppress "the high places, sacrifices, and in-cense-burning" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3, 4</a>). In almost all cases, the <span class="accented">not perfect</span> heart speaks of that which <span class="accented">began</span> well, but did not "endure unto the end." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-3.htm">2 Chronicles 25:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was established to him</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered "repair." The kal force of the word is simply to "be strong" (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>). The hiph., to "make strong," or "confirm," as it is rendered here, is found in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, "in his hand," follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. <span class="cmt_word">His servants</span>. It may be held surprising that they should have been found "in the <span class="accented">place</span>," or should now be <span class="accented">his servants</span> at all. The explanation may be either that their guilt had not yet been known, or, if <span class="accented">known</span>, had not been fixed upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-4.htm">2 Chronicles 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">But he slew not their children, but <i>did</i> as <i>it is</i> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slew not their children</span>. Emphasis (the emphasis of <span class="accented">mention</span>, at any rate) is laid upon this, perhaps partly to show that Amaziah did in some measure walk by "the Law of the Lord," and partly because of numerous cases that had grown up to the opposite (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>, <span class="accented">where, however, very possibly all were more or less aiders and abettors of the wickedness</span>). For Moses' clearly written rehearsal of "the commandment of the Lord," on this subject, see the marginal references, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4, 19, 20</a>.

Compare Asa's "five hundred and eighty thousand" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>), and Jehoshaphat's "eleven hundred and sixty thousand" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-19</a>; see <span class="accented">note, however, on these verses, and the improbability of numbers so high</span>). The Hebrew text of the second clause of this verse simply says, "he set them" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>), or placed them <span class="cmt_word">according to...  fathers' houses</span>, under captains, etc., glancing most naturally at <a href="../../par/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-2:34</a>.

The next verse tells us that "all the children of Ephraim" (which was strictly the northern Israel's chief tribe) are hereby designated. It is not quite clear that this Israel is exactly conterminous with the Israel of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>, the identity of which, however, with Joab's Israel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) is very probable. The boundaries of the strict tribe of Ephraim, whose ancestor was Joseph's younger son, are described in <a href="../../par/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>. The tribe were located as nearly as possible in the centre of the land. Ephraim, however, is here, as in many other places, as the name of the royal tribe, so named upon the whole of the northern kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-3.htm">Isaiah 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>; <span class="accented">several times in almost every chapter of Hosea, and for a typical instance</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/14-8.htm">Hosea 14:8</a>).

The drift of the <span class="accented">next</span> verse, which shows Amaziah a convert to the strong exhortation of the man of God, makes either alternative allowable under the present text very untimely. and not very much in accord with what we should look for at the lips of the man of God. The very conceivable way out of the difficulty is to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, hyphened to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span> (all the rather that no <span class="accented">vau</span> is present in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, as the present text is), and proceed to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span> again before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, crediting some copyist with confusion of eye through these having come close together in his manuscript. The rendering will then be straightforward, and prepare the way for Amaziah's yielding conformably with the tenor of the next verse. "But if not" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> if thou wilt not be guided by my remonstrance as to Ephraim), "go thou, be on the alert, exert all the strength possible for the battle, and yet nevertheless God will cause thee to stumble." And the remaining sentence may bear this significance, "For God hath power to help thee though alone, or to cast thee down though supported by an extra hundred thousand." If such alteration or conjectural restoration of the text be not accepted, we may harmonize the facts of the case with the most utter faithfulness of lip on the part of the prophet, by translating, "For in very truth, if thou go at all, and though thou make the best preparations, God shall make it go ill with thee." And Amaziah is persuaded to <span class="accented">this</span> point, that he will neither risk the lives of them of Ephraim vainly, nor risk the likelier displeasure of God on himself. He yields only partly, and therefore is nothing benefited. The difficulty is left untouched, that the prophet did not simply <span class="accented">in toto</span> forbid Amaziah to go, and that, saving them of Ephraim, he saves them to be a second scourge for the back of Amaziah, though he took his prophet's advice so far, and <span class="accented">lost his</span> own money. A careful and devout observer of human life and perverseness, when once these commit themselves to the vain struggle with God, and equally vain attempt to haggle with his providence as to how much to yield and how much to resist and with. hold, cannot but be struck with the photograph here thrown off, and that it is a faithful one, of hard facts that have met together disastrously times without number in men's lives. The sum, then, of the matter of our vers. 7, 8 may amount to this: "Under no circumstances take Israel, and if thou go thyself with all best preparations, yet know that God shall destroy thee." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-9.htm">2 Chronicles 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?

It may well be that they asked why they were discharged; and whether the right answer were given them, that the Lord dwelt not among them, or some wrong answer, it evidently did not improve matters, but rankled in their hearts till it found relief (vers. 13, 22), as they concluded that either their ability or fidelity, or both, were called in question. The 'Speaker's Commentary' very aptly cites the keen resentment and mortification that the Athenians are recorded to have felt in similar circumstances as told in Plutarch's 'Lives:' "Cimon," &sect;17. <span class="cmt_word">Separated them.</span> This is the verb occurring several times in the first verses of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>); there it is always followed by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, when speaking of the separating of two things <span class="accented">from</span> one another. Though this be meant here, it is not what is exactly said, and the prefix preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>before the substantive (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>) may, as Keil says, be regarded as designating the appositional accusative to that affixed in the shape of the pronoun "them" to the verb.

The hithp, conjugation of our already familiar verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; it was not a healthy strengthening, and this may be considered denoted in the fact that the work was all his own, and that he wrought himself up. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of</span> <span class="cmt_word">salt.</span> Commonly supposed to be the <span class="accented">plain</span> south of the Salt Sea, but according to Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' Appendix. &sect; 2. 5, pp. 482, 483), more probably a "ravine near Petra" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>).

There is little doubt that this is <span class="accented">Petra</span> (Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' 305; Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 87-92). The parallel tells us the interesting fact that Amaziah, perhaps under the influence of a spasmodic touch of devout-hess or gratitude, changed the name of Selah, or rather endeavoured to change it, to Joktheel, which Gesenius translates "subjugated of God." This name had already occurred in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>. The new name, however, did not last, as the Edomites recovered soon the country of (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1, 2</a>) Arabia Petraea, of which Selah or Petra was the capital.

The mention of Samaria before Beth-horon (see map) indicates it, and the words "sent back" may be held to imply, at least, that they first <span class="accented">went</span> back - that the disappointment of spoil was the chief part of their aggravations, so that now the rather they got their much spoil, and note made thereof, and that - since not so much the instructive and so far forth more excusable revenge on the part of the disappointed soldiers, but the deliberate plan and order of their king had brought about this devastation of Amaziah's domains, in <span class="accented">this</span> fact we have the key of what we read in our vers. 17, 18, etc., and of the very cool manner in which Amaziah challenged Joash.

The word occurs, beside the four times here and in the parallel, eight other times: <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>; <a href="../../par/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/2-2.htm">Song of Solomon 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>. Although, then, the word we have here is not the "bramble" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>) of <a href="../../par/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>, which also is brought before us in its contrast with Lebanon's cedar, yet the bramble bush, chiefly in virtue of its characteristic <span class="accented">thorn</span>, best answers to the average suggestions of all the twelve instances of the use of our word. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-19.htm">2 Chronicles 25:19</a></div><div class="verse">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to <i>thine</i> hurt, that thou shouldest fall, <i>even</i> thou, and Judah with thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - If the contents of this verse do not fail to impress with a persuasion of the keen mental gift of Joash, they do not fall far short of warranting some persuasion of a certain moral sense and goodness about him also. He knows human nature well, and Amaziah's particular variety therein perfectly well. And many would have snapped at the opportunity of humbling such a man. But not so Joash; he enjoys, indeed, the opportunity of satisfying his own sarcasm and patronizingness, but would still spare Amaziah's people and save him from himself. This does not resemble, at any rote, the commonest, poorest, hungriest style of soul. <span class="cmt_word">To boast</span>. Our text gives us here hiph. infinitive construct, where the parallel has niph. imperative. This lends the more effective shaft to the invective of Joash, though without material difference to the sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-20.htm">2 Chronicles 25:20</a></div><div class="verse">But Amaziah would not hear; for it <i>came</i> of God, that he might deliver them into the hand <i>of their enemies</i>, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The whole of the religious reflection, with its special post-Captivity significance of this verse, is wanting in the parallel, and finds no suggestion either thence or from common authorities. The parallel shows the statement, <span class="cmt_word">But Amaziah would not hear</span>, followed up immediately by "Therefore Jehoash...  went up." Our own verse, in the use of the plural pronoun them, and again <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, takes some slight amount of the weight of guilt in the matter of the idolatry from the shoulders of the king, that it may be shared by the people, and no doubt chiefly again by the "princes" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a></div><div class="verse">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, <i>both</i> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh</span>. The Beth-shomesh of Judah, on the borders of Judah, Dan, and the Philistines, is to be distinguished from that on the boundary of Issachar (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a>), and "the fenced city of Naphtali" (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-38.htm">Joshua 19:38</a>).

It led out on the north or north-west side of the city. There is very little to identify it with the high gate of Benjamin (see ditto, p. 346). The corner gate. This is not the translation of our Hebrew text (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, which, see margin, means "that looketh"), but of the Hebrew text of the parallel (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>); see pp. 343-346 of Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' and map facing p. 334, 2nd edit. Four hundred cubits. Probably about a hundred and eighty yards.

The present verse is an interesting one for pointing out the exact differences, even to the minutest of them, in what the two writers (of Kings and Chronicles) respectively took from a common original; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the writer of Kings has "he took;" leaves out "<span class="accented">Obed-Edom</span>;" has not the preposition "<span class="accented">in"</span> before "the house;" has "Jehovah" instead of "God;" has the preposition "<span class="accented">in"</span> before "<span class="accented">treasures</span>;" and has "Samaria<span class="accented">-ward"</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Samaria) instead of only "Samaria;" the writer of Chronicles differing in each of these respects. <span class="cmt_word">All the gold...  in the house of God.</span> See <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17, 18</a>, from which we must conclude that Hazael had already had the pick both for quantity and for quality. The hostages also; the phrase runs in the Hebrew text, "and sons [or, 'the sons'] of the hostages" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>); the literal rendering of which is "children or <span class="accented">sons</span> of <span class="accented">pledges</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">hostages.</span> The word (and indeed the practice <span class="accented">so</span> prevalent elsewhere) is found only here and in the parallel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-25.htm">2 Chronicles 25:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amaziah...   lived after the death of Joash</span>. The composition of the previous two verses dismisses delicately the fact that Joash, ignominiously bringing "Amaziah to Jerusalem" (ver. 23), contemptuously left him there, with a present of his life, though less his honour and much wealth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-26.htm">2 Chronicles 25:26</a></div><div class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The book of the kings of Judah and Israel</span>. The parallel has "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah." Considering the amount and the character of the resemblance that we have noticed between the narratives in Kings and in our own text, and assuming that the work to which each compiler calls attention for the fuller elucidation of his subject of biography is the work which he has himself most largely laid under 'contribution, then we should justly feel in this instance that we had no feeble argument for the identity of the two works, called by rather different titles - by the writer of the pre-Captivity, "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah," and by him of the post-Captivity, "the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."

It is, of course, in its matter intrinsically true, but none the less misleading in its <span class="accented">form.</span> The object of the writer cannot be doubted, as so many a cross-light is thrown upon it, in other places, viz. to connect the rise and the operativeness of the conspiracy with the <span class="accented">.fact</span> that (though not the exact date at which) the king had turned aside from Jehovah to idols. <span class="cmt_word">They made a conspiracy.</span> When every deduction is made, it may be that the conspiracy was one that was long hatching, and one which began in embryo from the date of Amaziah's ignominious return to Jerusalem. Very certain it is that this would be historic certainty with the Paris of the past century or more. The French would have required a deadly explanation of such an affront, if brought upon them by any ruler of theirs. <span class="cmt_word">He fled to Lachish</span>. In the Shefelah of Judah, and a strongly fortified place (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>).
