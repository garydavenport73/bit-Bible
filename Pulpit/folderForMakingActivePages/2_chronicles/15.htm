In our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>, we have again "God," with the verb "clothed" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). The grand original of the expression is, of course, found in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the name is "God." Compare Pharaoh's question in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> (the verb "clothed" is used in this last); five other times in Judges we have the Spirit of the Lord; in Samuel six times, and "the Spirit of God" another six times; in Kings, three times "the Spirit of the Lord." These passages exhibit incontestably the function, and the manifold function, of the Spirit! <span class="cmt_word">Azariah the son of Oded.</span> The Vulgate and Alexandrian Septuagint read here simply <span class="accented">Oded</span>; and Movers (p. 261) has suggested that "Oded the son of Azariah" is the correct reading for what now stands in the text; these are contrivances to meet the difficulty which the eighth verse occasions, and they are not so simple certainly as the proposal of Keil and Bertheau (following the Arabic Version) to omit altogether from ver. 8 the repetition of the name of the prophet, under the plea that the words, "of Oded the prophet," may so conceivably be owing to a copyist's meddlesome marginal reminiscence of ver. 1. It would have been, perhaps, a yet simpler method of overcoming the difficulty to account that the words, "Azariah the son of," had through a copy error slipped out of the text, except that the previous word, "the prophecy," is <span class="accented">not in</span> the construct state, and this favours Keil and Bertheau's suggestion (see our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), or rather the suggestion of the Arabic Version, which before them omits the words, "of Oded the prophet." The Vatican Septuagint has the readings in beth verses as Englished in the Authorized Version. Some think Oded may be one with Iddo of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>; pointing out that the Hebrew characters would permit it, if we suppose a <span class="accented">vau</span> added to the name Oded. This conjectural attempt to give this Prophet Azariah for son to Iddo seems to gain no great point. Of this Azariah nothing else is known; he is described as "son of Oded" probably to distinguish him from Azariah the high priest, son of Johanan (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142, second column, 3). (For the rest on this subject, see note on ver. 8.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD <i>is</i> with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went out to meet him;</span> literally, <span class="accented">into his presence</span>; but the Authorized Version rendering is very correct, as well as happy in expression (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a>; also see the remarkable and interesting verse, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-9.htm">2 Chronicles 28:9</a>). The prophet was the leader, the teacher, the suggester of the right and opportune thing to the people, but to the prophet the Lord himself was Leader, Teacher, Prompter, and it was exactly so now. To the very moment, the quickened moment of new thought and for new deed, divinest instruction and suggestion are ministered. The Lord is with you...  will forsake you. The original occasion of the beautiful language and word of covenant in the heart of this second part of the verse is enshrined in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>). It is just conceivable that these words by themselves are what are designated "the prophecy" (<span class="accented">and</span> "the prophecy") in ver. 8. They may be in the first place regarded as ancient quotations. They are also characterized by a certain self-containedness and weightiness of matter as compared with the historic illustrations of the following four verses. No corroborative <span class="accented">external</span> evidence of this conjecture, however, is forthcoming. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now for a long season Israel <i>hath been</i> without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now for a long season</span>. This translation is wrong; translate rather first, <span class="accented">And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law</span>. So far no tense is limited, however naturally through the very drift of the passage it may seem that <span class="accented">experience</span> is being challenged, and so necessarily the past tense desiderated, not, however, in <span class="accented">aorist</span> shape, but in what some French grammarians call present perfect. For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity "of Israel," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> (say) it <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the true God</span>; <span class="accented">happened to</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to not have teaching priest</span>; <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the Law</span> (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things <span class="accented">happen</span> altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and "present perfect." But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah <span class="accented">passim</span> to a degree beyond all "that is written" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, "many days" (which some translate "many a day," "many a time "), even the word "years" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely <span class="accented">picking out</span> the very colours to match (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29, 31</a>, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (<a href="../../par/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15, 18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31</a>: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30 -35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliverance

This is not very likely; still, the conjunction "and" would thereby better account for itself. Nevertheless, it would still remain that the word "prophecy" is not in <span class="accented">construct</span> but absolute state, and we cannot count the difficulty removed, comparatively unimportant as it may be<span class="cmt_word">. He took courage, and put away</span>, etc. These words may express either Asa's accomplishing of the reforms spoken of in the former chapter (vers. 3-5), or quite as probably his perseverance and renewed diligence and vigour in the same; the language, "he took courage," favours this latter view. <span class="cmt_word">The cities which he had taken from</span>, etc. Some say that the reference here and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> also must be understood to be to <span class="accented">Abijah's</span> victory and spoils (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), and that these two places must accordingly be in slight error. If this passage had stood alone, this view might have been more easy to accept, but the words in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> explicitly state that Asa had taken such cities, and the mere fact that the history does not record <span class="accented">when</span>, nor even show any very convenient gap into which Asa's taking of such cities after conflict with Israel might well fit in, can scarcely be allowed to override the direct assertion of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a>). At the same time, the work that would devolve on Asa in <span class="accented">holding</span> the cities his father Abijah had first taken, may easily account for all, and have been accounted Asa's taking, in the sense of <span class="accented">taking</span> to them, or retaking them. <span class="cmt_word">Renewed the altar</span>. The altar, the place of which was <span class="cmt_word">before the porch</span>, was the altar of burnt offering. The Hebrew for "renewed" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Vulgate translates insufficiently <span class="accented">dedicavit.</span> Bertheau thinks the renewal designs simply the purification of it from idolatrous defilements, although he admits that this is to assume that it had been defiled by idolatrous priests. Keil says the altar might well need genuine repair after the lapse of sixty years from the building of the temple. Of the nine occurrences of the word. five are metaphorical(as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>), but of the remaining four distinctly literal uses, including the present, three must mean just strictly "repair" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), and the probability may therefore be that such is the meaning now. Many, however, prefer the other view. The work of Ass, as described in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3-5</a>, was one of taking away, breaking down, and cutting down; but this item shows it now, in his fifteenth year, become also one of renewing. and repairing.

Another significant comment on the sameness of human nature in all time; the weak and the multitude will see, learn, do duty, less under pure conviction of right, than under the strong commanding influence of observation of where and with whom success goes, even if that success necessitate the owning of the Divine blessing as its cause (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19</a>). It should be noted, not for the sake of satire of human nature, but for the inculcation of the infinite importance of godly influence and example. <span class="cmt_word">Out of Simeon</span> (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). The "lines" of the Simeonites fell to them originally (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>) within Judah. The difficulty suggested by their being called, apparently, "strangers," and being certainly classed with the comers from "Ephraim and Manasseh," may be variously overcome, either by supposing that they had become more estranged from Judah in religious position than it was possible to them to have become in merely geographical; or that they had in some degree outgrown their own proper habitat, and had to some extent colonized a more northerly region (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>); or that, though, indeed, our compiler's composition undoubtedly places the Simeonites summoned, among <span class="accented">the strangers</span>, through mentioning them after Ephraim and Manasseh, yet this location of their name be held accidental, rather than due to special design.

This, probably, literally translated, says, <span class="accented">an hideous fright for, i.e.</span> <span class="accented">in place of Asherah, i.e.</span> Ashtoreth, or Astarte; but some translate to Asherah. The word we translate "an hideous fright" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) occurs only here and in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and its derivation root guides to this rendering; but some give it the idea of an object of reverent fear among idols<span class="cmt_word">.

The word used in the parallel is "cut off;" or "cut down; of course also preparatory to burning. <span class="cmt_word">At the brook Kidron</span>. The Kidron was a torrent rather than a <span class="accented">brook</span>. It flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and finally emptied itself into the Dead Sea. The references to Kidron in the Old Testament are interesting, but all reinvested with heightened interest from those in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>, compared with what the parallels infer; <a href="../../par/mark/14-26.htm">Mark 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>). The first two references in the Old Testament are <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>. Passing these, the present place, with its parallel, brings the Kidren valley next under notice as, the place of destruction for Maachah's obscene phallic abomination, and then (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>) as the place where Athalish was destroyed. Its associations are similar when spoken of in <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4, 6, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>, becoming the "regular receptacle for the impurities and abominations of the idol-worship, when removed from the temple and destroyed by the adherents of Jehovah." In the time of Josiah, this valley was the common burying-place of the city (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a></div><div class="verse">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high places were not taken away out of Israel</span>. It is possible, but scarcely tenable, that, by Israel, the northern kingdom may be here intended. But for the apparent discrepancy with those places which say that Asa <span class="accented">did</span> take away "the high places" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3, 5</a>), see notes under them, and &sect;7. 1, pp. 16, 17, of 'Introduction to 1 Chronicles.' "The high places" were hills on which sacrifices were illegitimately offered instead of at the chosen place - at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of Asa was perfect all his days</span>. The words, "with Jehovah," following after the word "perfect" in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>), makes the already plain plainer. The exact meaning is that Asa was consistently free from idolatry to the end.

From what sources and after what victories the father of Asa and Asa himself had drawn these supplies is not given either here or in the parallel, but it is natural to suppose that Abijah's victory over Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-16.htm">2 Chronicles 13:16</a>) and Asa's over Zerah would have been the chief occasions to finnish them.

The Hebrew text should be adhered to, which simply says, <span class="accented">there was not war unto</span>, etc The <span class="cmt_word">five and thirtieth year.</span> There can be little doubt that the text originally said "twentieth," not "thirtieth" (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16.htm">2 Chronicles 16</a>-1). The parallel, after the identical words Of the previous verse already noted, goes on emphatically to speak of the fact that "there was war between Asa and Baasha all their days;" and the same statement is repeated in the thirty-second verse of the sa<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16, 32</a>). The following verse (33) says that Baasha's twenty-four-year reign began in Asa's third year. Putting the various and apparently somewhat varying statements together, they must be held to say, <span class="accented">first</span>, that a state of war was, indeed, chronic between Asa and Baasha (which way of putting need not disturb the correctness of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5, 6</a>, and of the fifteenth verse of our chapter), but that in the six and twentieth year of Asa, which would be the last or last but one of Baasha's life, latent war gave place to active hostilities, and Baasha (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) came up to Judah to invade it, and to build Ramah - a course of conduct which was the beginning of the end for him (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a>; our ver. 10; and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1, 9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
