It is probable that Azariah was the first-used name, that the latter name was not a corruption of the former, but that, for whatever reason, the king was called by both names. Nevertheless, the apt analogy that has been pointed out of Uzziel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>) and Azareel (18) is noteworthy. (See Keil and Bertheau on <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>; and Keil on our present passage.) <span class="cmt_word">Sixteen years old</span>. Therefore Uzziah must have been born just before the fatal outside mistake of his father's life in the challenge he sent to Joash of Israel, and after the deadly inner mistake of his soul in turning aside to "the gods of the children of Seir." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a></div><div class="verse">He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>; the parallel reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. This place was at the head of the Gulf Akaba (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>); Judah had lost hold of it at a past revolt of Edom, and Uzziah, after his father's crippling of Edom, seizes the opportunity of making it Judah's again and rebuilding it, thus finishing very probably a work that he knew had been in his father's heart to do. This consideration may explain alike the following clause in our verse. and the placing of this <span class="accented">here.</span> Uzziah charged himself to do it the first thing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a></div><div class="verse">Sixteen years old <i>was</i> Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem.

This name is spelt <span class="accented">Jecholiah</span> in the parallel. The character, however, is <span class="accented">kappa</span> in both texts. The meaning of the name is, "Made strong of Jehovah." Another unreliable form of the name is <span class="accented">Jekiliah</span>, the result probably of a mere clerical error.

His father's comparatively long reign, sullied by two frightful stains, which were fearfully visited with a long punishment and a fatal end, is graciously recognized here for the good that was in it, and apparently credited even with a "balance to the good." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Zechariah</span>. Twice in the foregoing chapter we have read of "a man of God" and "a prophet" whose names are not given. The chariness of the narrative in this exact respect is not very explicable, for if the simple reason be assumed to be that they were not of much repute, now when the name of <span class="accented">Zechariah</span> is given, all that we can say is that nothing else is known of him. <span class="cmt_word">Had understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>.

Some slight discrepancy in the usual fuller writing of the word in some manuscripts lends a little ground of preference for the reading, which a few manuscripts evidently had (see Septuagint Version, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span>,), of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in the fear of God" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3</a>); either reading in either of these sub-clauses leaves an undisturbed good meaning to the description of Zechariah.

It has been seen how the Philistines, humbled to tribute under Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10-13</a>), had lifted up their heads repeatedly since, as on one occasion in alliance with Arabians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16, 17</a>) against Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">Brake down the wall</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-23.htm">2 Chronicles 25:23</a>, the first occasion of this exact expression). <span class="cmt_word">Gath</span> (see the parallel to our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23, 24</a> in <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jabneh</span>.

Also on the coast, about eight miles south of Jabneh (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>).

Built cities about <span class="cmt_word">Ashdod</span>; Revised Version supplies in italic type" <span class="accented">in the country</span> of Ashdod." However, the force of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> before "Ashdod" in this case speaks for itself; on account of the great importance of the place, in respect of its situation, on the road to Egypt, the strength of its position and perhaps the memory of the fact that, allotted to Judah, it had never really been appropriated by her, and incorporated with her, Uzziah saw it expedient to surround it with other fortified cities, or strong forts, which should be a watch upon it.

For the corner gate, see our note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-23.htm">2 Chronicles 25:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Valley gate</span>. This is called by some the Gehenna gate.

This word occurs eleven times, viz. twice in Exodus, four times in Nehemiah, four times in Ezekiel, and in this place, and is always rendered "corner" or" turning;" the word wanted is <span class="accented">angle.</span> The site of this gate cannot very certainly be pronounced upon. Perhaps the angle that marks the gate is that at the south-east corner of the temple plateau. The language of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> is our best clue: "Next to him Ezer repaired...  a piece over against the going up to the armoury <span class="accented">at the turning."</span>

This conjugation frequently occurs in the sense of "destroying," but also as well without an accusative as with, in the sense of "doing corruptly" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> with accusative; but without <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-29.htm">Deuteronomy 31:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a>; and next chapter, ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">He transgressed</span>. The "transgression" of a heart that had waxed wanton through prosperity took that peculiarly aggravated form of sinning against holy things and a holy ceremonial. Although, in the daily service of the second temple, the duty of offering incense attached to one chosen by lot each morning and evening of the inferior priests, yet originally the <span class="accented">high</span> priest was solemnly appointed for this office. The following are among the most important references to the matter of the incense and its offering (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1, 7, 8, 34, 37, 38</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-21.htm">Luke 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>).

Ver. 20 states what was otherwise to be supposed, that he was the chief priest (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>). We fail to identify his name with any in the typical list of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-15</a>, where the Azariah of ver. 11 is too early, and the Azariah of ver. 13 too late, for our present Azariah. <span class="cmt_word">With him four score priests</span>. This passage suggests to us an idea of how many deeply interesting details are wanting, which would fill in the interstices of Old Testament history. Probably the intention of the king, ambitious to simulate the self-assumed religious ways of neighbouring Gentile kings, was no secret; and possibly the king may have given time for the chief priest to collect his auxiliaries, through some ostentatious display on his own part, in the very performance of his desecration. The number and the character of these helping priests (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) give the idea that they had their work to do, and purposed doing it promptly, or that they would over-awe, and obviate the use of actual force, by their imposing number. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a></div><div class="verse">And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, <i>It appertaineth</i> not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither <i>shall it be</i> for thine honour from the LORD God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They withstood</span>. A somewhat more forcible rendering would be justified by the Hebrew text, such <span class="accented">e.g. as</span>, "They confronted Uzziah to his face," or "They stood in the way of Uzziah," since our "withstood" almost always conveys the idea of argumentative confronting only. There was expostulation here, as we are immediately told, but there was something else also, as ver. 20 makes very plain, "They thrust him out." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-19.htm">2 Chronicles 26:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then Uzziah was wroth, and <i>had</i> a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Render, <span class="accented">Then Uzziah was wrath, and in his hand</span> (at that moment) <span class="accented">was a censer to burn incense</span>, etc. From the most literal rendering of the Hebrew text, not unfrequently the most forcible Bible English results. <span class="cmt_word">From beside</span>; render, at <span class="accented">the very side of</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>).

Evidently, from the next clause, no great force in the ordinary sense was needed. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, himself hasted</span>. The Hebrew verb is niph. conjugation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. It is interesting to note that this root occurs only here and three times in Esther, viz. 3:15; 6:12; 8:14. Uzziah can scarcely have been ignorant that he had been daring the utmost penalty of the Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>).

The verbal root is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and occurs once (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-20.htm">Leviticus 19:20</a>, with the Authorized Version rendering "was free;" in the same verse is also found a feminine noun derived from it, and rendered in the Authorized Version "freedom"). The adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> occurs sixteen times, and is always rendered in the Authorized Version "free," except once "at liberty" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16</a>). The "freedom" conveyed by the word is that of <span class="accented">separation</span>, in the use of it as found here. The leper and the house in which he lived were kept free from contact with others (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Gesenius appears, however, to prefer the idea of "infirmity," "sickness," as determining the cast of the meaning of the word in our text, and goes so far as to translate it an "hospital," quoting the word of Suidas, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Isaiah the prophet asserts that his prophetic inspiration was in Uzziah's time (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), or we should have taken for granted that, as he was alive in the time of Hezekiah, grandson to Uzziah, he wrote of Uzziah only from hearsay and previous records. It must be concluded, accordingly, that Isaiah's inspiration as a prophet was early in his own life, that the beginning of it dated not long before the end of Uzziah's career, and that his life was a prolonged one, while still the most part of <span class="cmt_word">the acts first and last of Uzziah</span>, which he wrote, must have consisted of a compilation from other treatises and perhaps partly from tradition.
