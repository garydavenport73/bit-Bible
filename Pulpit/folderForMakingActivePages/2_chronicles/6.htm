This thing which he said, and did, even while really instructing, after the manner of special revelation, a specialized people, is essentially what he ever has said and ever is doing in all time, in all the world, and in all nature and providence. It is a fact and it is necessary that his glory be for the present veiled in "clouds and darkness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. n).

They contrast with the wandering people, and wandering worship and sacrifices, and wandering tent and tabernacle with all their sacred contents (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-6.htm">1 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-16</a>).

What words Solomon used in thus blessing <span class="cmt_word">the whole congregation</span> are not given either here or in the parallel. The impression one takes is that the blessing was, in fact, wrapt up tacitly in all that Solomon recounts, when he said, <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</span>, etc. (ver. 4). However, it is not impossible that, with the variation of the tense in ver. 59, the verses of <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55 - 61</a> may contain the substance of it, if not itself.

Probably delivered from earthly feeling, and sheltered just now from self and human ambition, Solomon was in a very high degree "in the spirit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>) on this great day. The moment was a proud moment in Solomon's history, as well there may be proud moments in men's lives, but it was divinely shielded, as divinely inspired. Hereafter, for all that, "the thorn in the flesh" might become very necessary, lest Solomon "be exalted above measure" in the memory of all that had transpired.

This means to say that Solomon stood (and afterwards knelt down) <span class="accented">eastward</span> of the altar indeed, but with his face to the temple and congregation. Although the voice of Solomon was raised in prayer to God, yet the prayer was to be that of the whole congregation and not of priestly proxy, and therefore of the whole congregation it must be heard.

The prayer which this verso opens occupies twenty-eight verses; it is the longest prayer recorded in Scripture. It consists of two verses (14, 15) of opening; then follow three petitions - first, that God would perpetuate the line of David (ver. 16); <span class="accented">next</span>, that he would have regard to the place where his Name is put (vers. 17-20); and <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, that he would hear the prayers addressed to him toward this place (ver. 21).

Not only are many of the psalms utterly in harmony with the spirit of this verse, but also the light of it is reflected brilliantly in such passages as <a href="../../par/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>. This house is called by thy Name; literally, <span class="accented">thy Name is called upon</span> (or perhaps, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented">this house</span>, meaning that God himself is invoked there, or present there in order that he may be constantly invoked. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-33.htm">2 Chronicles 6:33</a></div><div class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens, <i>even</i> from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as <i>doth</i> thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-34.htm">2 Chronicles 6:34</a></div><div class="verse">If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - The different supposition of these verses, compared with vers. 24, 25, is plain. Here we are reminded how right it is to implore a blessing before we go out to our allotted labour, or even on some specially and divinely appointed enterprise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-35.htm">2 Chronicles 6:35</a></div><div class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</div><div class="comm">

The prayer is remarkable all the more as the last of the whole series, and one so sadly ominous! The <span class="accented">last</span> clause of ver. 36, carrying the expression <span class="cmt_word">far off</span>, as the alternative of near, throws its lurid glare of unwelcome suggestion on all the rest. <span class="cmt_word">No</span> <span class="cmt_word">man which sinneth not</span>. The words need the summoning of no biblical parallels, for these are so numerous. But out of the rest emphasis may be placed at least on those furnished by Solomon himself - <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:21</a>; both of which are particularly sententious. <span class="cmt_word">Bethink themselves</span>. The words well express, in English idiom, the literal Hebrew, as in margin, "bring back to their heart" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Have sinned, ... done amiss,...  dealt wickedly</span> (so <a href="../../par/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>). The Authorized Version in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>) is somewhat happier in its rendering of the three verbs employed here. It seems doubtful whether these have it in them to form a climax; more probably they speak of three different <span class="accented">directions</span> in wrong going. The parallel is well worthy of being referred to, in its vers. 50, 51.
