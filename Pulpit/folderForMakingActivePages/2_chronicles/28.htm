A previous unsuccessful attempt of Rezin and Pekah is apparently passed over in our chapter (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>), while the contents of our present yeas must be understood to have its place just before the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel, and to be significantly confirmed by the contents of its following verse. <span class="cmt_word">They smote...   carried away...  brought</span>. These <span class="accented">plurals</span> strongly <span class="accented">indicate the</span> dialocation of sentences in compiled matter.

The mode of the first introduction of the name of Ahaz in connection with Damascus in the parallel (ver. 10) is a suggestive illustration of how these parallel but very various narratives proffer to piece themselves, and in <span class="cmt_word">a</span> wonderful manner clear their, whole subject of any possible taint of the "cunningly devised fable." <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude</span> of Judah's people had been <span class="cmt_word">carried captives</span> and "brought to Damascus." When the King of Assyria (parallel, ver. 9) came to the help of Ahaz, he struck a fierce and evidently decisive blow against Damascus and Rezin, and to Damascus," to meat" Assyria's king, Tiglath-Pileser, the very next verso tells us, Ahaz. went - little doubt to pay his bills, over which a decent veil of silence is thrown. <span class="cmt_word">He was also delivered into the hand</span>, etc. The form of this sentence, with its "also," and with its evidently tacked-on appearance, coupled with the conjunction "for" with which the following verso is dragged in, seems to give great probability to the idea, <span class="accented">first</span>, that the latter half of ver. 5 and all of ver. 6 find their real place before (say) the word "Damascus;" and secondly, that they are strictly and conterminously paralleled by the former part of ver. 5 parallel.

The number is large, but, the uncertainty of very many of these figures notwithstanding, it is impossible absolutely to pronounce it incredible. Because they had forsaken.

This can scarcely mean the child of Ahaz, considering Ahaz's age; some think a brother of the present king, son of Jotham, may be intended. We have also to fall back upon the use of the phrase, "king's son," for some special official of the king or court (see note on 2 Chronicles 18:25; and its parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The governor of the house</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">ruler.</span> We have probably a sufficient clue to this designation in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; and the designation itself, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Next to the king</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>; literally, therefore, <span class="accented">the next of the king</span>, the general meaning of which expression cannot be doubtful (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-9.htm">Nehemiah 11:9</a>), but the exacter scope and functions of the person under the kings of the divided kingdom thus designated is less certain. It is naturally to be supposed his place may have been king's deputy in councils in his absence, or in and over the city itself, when he was at a distance with an army. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-8.htm">2 Chronicles 28:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Samaria</span>. While the Syrian king carried his captives to Damascus (ver. 5), the Israel king carried his to Samaria. The numbers in this verse, with the added hundred and twenty thousand whom Pekah slew (ver. 6), may be compared with the military strength of the kingdom in Uzziah's time, as given in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-13.htm">2 Chronicles 26:13</a>.

The growingly frequent references to the interposition of the prophets is much to be noticed, and their dignity, courage, fidelity, are brought into grand relief. They are very typical of the moral presence of which no national history, a.s centuries solemnly flow on, gives the slightest symptom of a slackening need. The very same may be said alike of the truth and those qualified and commissioned to bear it, of the message and the messenger. <span class="cmt_word">Before the host</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in very face of the host, somewhat too mildly rendered "to meet" the host, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">In a rage that reacheth up unto heaven</span>. To the wonderful life of this figure, that must strike every reader, must be added the force that comes of its moral rather than merely material suggestion - a moral suggestion that reminds us of that of the sentence of far greater antiquity, and from the sacred lip of the Inspirer of all prophets, "The voice of thy brother's blood <span class="accented">crieth unto me</span> from the ground." The rage had not been that on which the sun did <span class="accented">not</span> go down; it had been so fierce that upon it the sun ought never to have been required to look. See for interesting particulars and then more general references, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>. The expression of the text, however, "reach-eth," or "toucheth," cannot be understood to reproduce as a perfect equivalent the older above-quoted one of "crieth." In other words, the magnitude of the rage is the first thing set forth, and the particular language in which it is set forth well postulates the inference of its abominableness in God's sight.

We do not know particulars of these four worthier men, whose names, with their fathers', are here "expressed" (ver. 15).

The repentant temper of these "heads of the children of Ephraim" was admirable, and indicated their distance from many, many others of their people and day, and Of Judah, who were either callous or reckless.

This is in our writer's usual deeper moral and religious vein, and was no doubt most true. For all Ahaz paid and bribed out of the sacrilegiously employed treasure of the temple, out of the depreciating and partial dismantling of "the house of the king," and out of the begged contributions or taxes extortionately wrung "of the princes" (see the succinct account of next verse, and compare the parallel in its vers. 8, 18), he bought a master for himself, servitude, tributariness, and the humiliation of disgrace itself. The temporary relief he obtained (and which the writer of Chronicles in no way means to deny) from one enemy rivetted round his neck the yoke of another and greater. And worse than this, he secured in his own heart the greatest adversary of all - a restless, implacable foe, which ever goaded him on to worse folly and deeper sin.

The writer must be understood to speak from the point of view of Ahaz, in putting it, that it was the gods of Damascus who smote." The formula, all Israel, is a clear instance of how the name "Israel" is used as "Judah." The <span class="accented">gods of Damascus</span> were, of course, the same with those of Syria, of which Damascus was capital. Their names were Rimmon, Tabrim-men, Hadad, and some others. Perhaps no verse in Chronicles is more typical of the special moral aspects and aims of the writer.

Vers. 17, 18 of the parallel enlarge our view of what Ahaz did in the way of destruction, relating his mutilation of the bases and laver and sea, after also the displacement of the brazen altar in favour of that the pattern of which he had sent from Damascus to Urijah the priest, who must have been a consenting party to the iniquity. Our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a> speaks of the time that came when these wicked steps of king and priest began to be retraced, and, with the previous verses of same chapter, are the sad but interesting reverse of the present passage. The modern Jews commemorate, by the observance of a fast, this mournful crisis of Judah's history.
