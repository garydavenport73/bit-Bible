It is not hard to see how they would both lead him, if not always out of big and patronizing thoughts, to seek and also lay him open to be sought. When this verse says Jehoshaphat joined affinity, etc., it means that he had done so. to wit, not fewer than nine years before, in promoting or allowing, whichever it was, the marriage of his son Jehoram with Ahab's and Jezebel's daughter Athaliah. For the issue of this marriage, Ahaziah, took the throne at the age of twenty-two years, thirteen years hence from this seventeenth year of his grandfather Jehoshaphat's reign, the year of Ahab's death. But as we are told that Ahaziah was the <span class="accented">youngest</span> son of Jehoram and Athaliah (for explanation of which see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), the "joining affinity" must have been something earlier than nine years, and very probably came yet nearer the prosperity of the earlier years of Jehoshaphat's reign, with which would agree well the keynote touched again significantly here from our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-5.htm">2 Chronicles 17:5</a>. Comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a> (which needs the correction of <span class="accented">twenty-two to forty-two</span>). Although it is certain that the act of Jehoshaphat was wrong in principle, disastrous in practice (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2, 3</a>), and threatened fatal consequences to himself (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31, 32</a>), yet it is not impossible to suppose his motives were for the most part good, and he may naturally have thought that the sunshine of his own peace and abundance might be the set time to win influence in and over Israel, rather than strengthen Israel in its ungodly independence. On the other hand, nothing could justify Jehoshaphat risking such intimacy of relationship with such a family, heedless of consequences, looking towards idolatry, which he should have known were overwhelmingly probable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-2.htm">2 Chronicles 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And after <i>certain</i> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that <i>he had</i> with him, and persuaded him to go up <i>with him</i> to Ramothgilead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">years he went down</span>. In lieu of the italic type "<span class="accented">certain"</span> here, the English idiom, "years after," would aptly reproduce the facts of the case. This journey to Samaria to see Ahab was made in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). What were the precise antecedent circumstances of this visit of Jehoshaphat to Ahab it is interesting to surmise - whether it were the fruit of an invitation direct from Ahab, who had his own designs, or whether it were for diplomatic reasons, that worked in the mind of Jehoshaphat as well as of Ahab, in view of Syria. It is evident that Ahab promptly determined to improve this conference of kings. <span class="cmt_word">Persuaded him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps to induce him. This is the uniform signification of the word here used in the eighteen times of its occurrence, and mostly in doubtful, or worse than doubtful, matter. The form is the hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, in which conjugation only the verb occurs. The Revised Version renders "moved." The visiting and cooperating of Jehoshaphat and Ahab made a novel departure in the history of the rended kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and continued till the time of Jehu. <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth-Gilead</span>. This important city of Gad (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), in Palestine beyond Jordan, comes into question as one not surrendered to the king-dora of Israel in good faith, according to the promise of Benhadad (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>; comp. 1, 4, 7, 11, 20, 30, 33), Benhadad's father having taken it from Omri, father of Ahab. For "all the might that he showed," and presumably in conflicts with Syria, Omri was evidently a heavy loser. <span class="accented">Ramoth-Gilead</span> means "the heights of Gilead." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I <i>am</i> as thou <i>art</i>, and my people as thy people; and <i>we will be</i> with thee in the war.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am as thou</span>, etc. The same unqualified kind of language was used By Jehoshaphat on another occasion (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7</a>), two years later, when Jehoram, son of the deceased Ahab, also asked his help against Moab. Whether on the one occasion or the other, it is quite possible that Jehoshaphat thought he was serving common interests, and the cause of his own kingdom, as well as of Israel; nevertheless "Jehu the son of Hanani the seer" ignores the supposed justification (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-4.htm">2 Chronicles 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The wording of this verse is identical with that of the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a>). Jehoshaphat, if even not quite conscious of it, is throwing some sop to his conscience in essaying to become, and posing as, the godly counsellor of "the ungodly" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). At any rate, his counsel is right, even to the point of urging to-day, and significantly deprecating procrastination. It is not, however, so clear that he was, in the first instance, as decided in respect of the necessity of inquiring the will of the Lord at the mouth of a true prophet, in distinction from a prophet merely of Israel, though they should be "four hundred" in number! Compare the following two verses, however, which show as though he was holding himself quite prepared and on the look-out for the expected occasion of having to rein Ahab up! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

Their <span class="accented">word</span> speedily showed itself <span class="accented">not</span> the <span class="accented">word of the Lord</span>, but the word that was made up to order of the king, and to suit his known wish at any time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-6.htm">2 Chronicles 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">But Jehoshaphat said, <i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The Revised Version well at-ranges the words of this verse, "Is there not here besides a prophet of the Lord?" The conscience of Ahab successfully made a coward of him, that he took so quietly this pronounced slight put on his kingdom s prophets (<span class="accented">prophetae vitulorum</span>) by his brother-king Jehoshaphat! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-7.htm">2 Chronicles 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <i>There is</i> yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same <i>is</i> Micaiah the son of Imla.

This true prophet of the Lord is known only here in recorded history, but it is evident he was otherwise well known to his generation and to Ahab (ver. 25). The outspokenness of Ahab and the sustained courtesy of Jehoshaphat are alike agreeable to notice in this verse.

Any way, the unreal prophets have their full opportunity and their say at least twice over, as also Micaiah below (vers. 14, 16, 18-22, 27). A void place; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a level floor; Revised Version, <span class="accented">an open place.</span> The Hebrew word designates often just a "threshing-floor," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>; but quite possibly here, a recognized court at the gate of the city, used for judgment, is intended.

For other particulars of him, borrowed from the doubtfulness of Josephus, Bee Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1836. <span class="cmt_word">Had made him horns of iron.</span> It would seem as though Zedekiah had made these "horns of iron" at some <span class="accented">previous time</span>, or, perhaps, now simulated some very rough presentation of horns of an impromptu kind.

It has been well described as the ironical echo of the language of the unreal prophets. Micaiah begins by answering a fool according to his folly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his own heart's desire. He had just come from some place of imprisonment or punishment (ver. 25). And he so spoke or so looked that the king should know he had not spoken his last word in answer to the inquiry addressed to him.

This and the following three verses must have told, manifestly <span class="accented">did</span> tell, with fearful force of faithful preaching, upon the unreal prophets and the wicked king. How it was that their contents did not avail with Jehoshaphat to throw full energy again into his conscience, and to enable him to break at once with Ahab and his expedition, is inexplicable (and the more as it was his own pressing suggestion that the true prophet should be summoned), except as another illustration of the fearful difficulty that lies so often to human weakness, in the way of retracing a false step. Both these visions (vers. 16, 18-22) well illustrate how God revealed his truth, will and specific messages to his true prophets <span class="accented">in vision</span>. The vision of the throne, grand in all the majesty of its simplicity, of the psalmists (9, 11, 45, 103.), of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>), of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), of Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>), of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>), of St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>), is part of heaven's own stamp of authentication of the Bible.

He declares, on the authority of his rapt vision, that it is because <span class="accented">they</span> are possessed by a lying spirit (<a href="../../par/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). And, like the true prophet of all time, he declares it at all hazards and at all cost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-23.htm">2 Chronicles 18:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?</span> This question of Zedekiah, and Micaiah's answer to him in the following verse, arc both obscure and of doubtful interpretation, but their drift not at all so. Keil and Bertheau correctly say, - in that Zedekiah used the force and the language that he did, it is not a bad sign that he was under a spirit's influence, but in that it was <span class="accented">physical</span> force which he used in a moral subject, this was a conclusive sign of the <span class="accented">character</span> of the spirit that he was amenable to. Among many possible suggestions as to the exact meaning of the question, "Which way," etc.? it is possible that a sceptical taunt best explains Zedekiah's words, and that he meant that he did not believe the Spirit of the Lord went <span class="accented">any</span> way to Micaiah. He will not yield to a doubt or to a suspicion thrown upon it that the Spirit had been with himself, and he will fain throw great doubt, whether he had proceeded from him to Micaiah! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-24.htm">2 Chronicles 18:24</a></div><div class="verse">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - So also, probably, this verse would purport to tell us beforehand distinctly what is not told after the issue of the battle and Ahab's death, that Zedekiah and his co-prophets did what they could, however vainly, to hide and to elude the vengeance of Jezebel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-30.htm">1 Kings 20:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-25.htm">1 Kings 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>).

The last of these three words tells, of course, its own tale, of what had already been the treatment accorded to Micaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Amon the governor...  Joash the king's son.</span> This latter person is found only here and in the parallel, and the designation given him probably does not intend a personal relationship to the king, but an official; so see again <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>; and note the conjunction again of the governor of the house, in the next clause. The Vulgate translates the Hebrew for "the king's," as though it were a proper name, "Amelech." See also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' under the name "Maaseiah" 17. Nor is <span class="accented">Amon</span> <span class="accented">the governor</span> known elsewhere except in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), but these designations, as through some chinks, throw a little scanty light into the subject of the internal administration at this time of the kingdom of Israel. In this kingdom subsequent to the separation, decentralization seems to have been carried to a further point than in Judah, and considering its greater extent, its far inferior metropolitan force, its double place of worship and sacrifice, these largely idolatrous, and in all this the undoubted degraded authority of its central government, this is very explainable. It is true that in both kingdoms history speaks equally of such offices and officers as were distinctly military or looked that way, but it can scarcely be without a reason that for the numerous allusions in Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8-17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-6.htm">2 Kings 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>) to councils of elders (well known before the disruption), and governors of palaces, of cities, of houses, and of provinces, there is scarcely one in the records of Judah. Here possibly enough the executive would be more vigorous, more compact, and more direct and close in its action from headquarters, while in both divisions of what should have been the one kingdom, royalty was by profession constitutional, and in its devolution hereditary.

It must be presumed that there was something to relieve Ahab's language of the barefaced disregard for the safety of Jehoshaphat and regard for his own, which lie on the surface of the words he uses. Quite possibly, for instance, <span class="accented">both</span> knew that Ahab was to be <span class="accented">the</span> mark of the shooters. Also Ahab's <span class="cmt_word">disguise</span> may have meant a heavy price to pay to his pride, while Jehoshaphat's dignity was saved intact. So, too, Ahab may have merely purported to say, "You can, without any special risk, wear your royal apparel; but I," etc,

Therefore, if the place of vers. 29, 30 were inverted, what reads like the cool suggestion of Ahab in ver. 29 would seem more tolerable. Mean. time, Benhadad's command argues the intensity of his resentment towards Ahab, and not less ungrateful forgetfulness for the ultimate consideration that Ahab had allowed to him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-31.htm">1 Kings 20:31-34</a>).

The cry fulfilled its purpose, and if Jehoshaphat <span class="accented">had</span> a sneaking love for Ahab (see the significant "love them," etc., of Jehu in second verse of next chapter), he evidently had not any idea of needlessly dying for him. The happy distinction of perceiving in next verse, as compared with seeing in this verse, is not warranted by the Hebrew text (in both cases <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), though it is by the gist of the connection and English idiom,

The arrow went through, or by the side of one of the actual articulations of the armour-mail worn. Ahab's direction to the chariot-driver at the spur of the first wounded moment to turn and carry him <span class="cmt_word">out of the host</span>, was evidently qualified, when he found that the wound was not immediately fatal. As the heat of the battle grew, and victory did not at once turn one way or the other, he was the more anxious to give the moral support of his presence to the last to his army, and, unable to stand by himself, he was supported by his own orders (so our rendering is not inconsistent with that in the parallel "<span class="accented">was stayed"</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) in the chariot till he died in the evening. Although the spirit of Ahab, and his fidelity to his own army, kingdom, and self, cannot but appear to advantage in these last incidents of his unworthy life, yet it is probable that they find their record here for the sake of giving clear statement to the fact, that in the chariot his life-bleed collected according to the saying of the parallel (ver. 35 compared with ver. 38). Note, therefore, particularly the truncated history of the writer of Chronicles in this instance. He, no doubt, consciously omitted, and with a purpose, his own usual purpose; but light is lost, and the cross light tends rather to misleading, except for that only correct user of Scripture, which teaches us to compare one Scripture with another, and balance one part against another - a thing easy to do in matters of fact, but too often forgotten in the weightier matter of doctrine. Here our eighteenth chapter closes, less the mention of the proclamation for the self-disbanding of Ahab's army (ver. 36 of the parallel chapter) which should fulfil the prophecy of our ver. 16, and less any mention of Ahab's burial, of the washing of his chariot in the pool of Samaria, of the dogs licking up of the blood there, and of his ivory house, etc. (vers. 37-40 of the parallel chapter). All of which omittings accord well with the one clear ecclesiastical and religious intent of the Chronicles, in place of the pursuit of matters of general and merely graphic historic interest, however charged with instruction they too might be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
