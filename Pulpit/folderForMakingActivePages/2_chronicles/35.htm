We can only conjecture why the ark was not in its proper place, probably having been temporarily removed during Josiah's own restorations, or possibly having never been yet replaced from the date of some earlier removal of an iniquitous character and on the part of an iniquitous king. Secondly, as to the burden, some would explain the language as a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of the general and ever-applicable principle found in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. This, at any rate, would seem rather more satisfactory than the suggestion conveyed by the italic type of our Authorized Version. Perhaps the explanation may rather be that the ark had latterly again and again been shifted, and Josiah wishes to protest that neither for one reason nor another shall it be again moved.

For it was kept on the proper day in the first month, and was not a mere supplementary Passover; it was observed with due regularity, and not by worshippers some of whom were unclean; and if we allow thirteen persons for each lamb or kid, there were upwards of half a million communicants; while, so far as we know, there were only seventeen thousand sheep presented by Hezekiah and his princes (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-24.htm">2 Chronicles 30:24</a>), which would not supply more than half the number of partakers.

A period of about thirteen years of happy retrospect is now the portion of the good king. This period brings itself to an unhappy and even fatal termination in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>; when, as it would appear by the result, King Josiah did wrong, and went out of his way, in opposing the march of Pharaoh-Necho (who reigned  <span class="date">B.C. 611-595</span>), successor of Psammetichus King of Egypt, against Cyaxares (the monarch who, with Nabo-polassar, had taken Nineveh,  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>) King of <span class="accented">Assyria</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), or King of Babylon at <span class="accented">Circesium on the River Phrat</span>, the head-quarters now of the united Assyrian and Babylonian power. Where the fault or sin of Josiah lay - whether he ran before he was sent, or whether, according to our following two verses, he set out <span class="accented">against</span> the Divine word by Necho - is certainly a question left in obscurity. Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing <span class="accented">except</span> what silence and the result <span class="accented">seem</span> to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have <span class="accented">every</span> reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a></div><div class="verse">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? <i>I come</i> not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from <i>meddling with</i> God, who <i>is</i> with me, that he destroy thee not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not against thee this day</span>.

It is indeed possible that they might purport, from the pen of the writer of Chronicles, that in point of fact the words of Necho had been the permitted warning, though not the actually dictated language of God. The genius of the whole passage strongly reminds us of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17, 19-21</a>; and its parallel in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of Megiddo</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among those hills which separate the country of the coast from Esdraelon - a valley as that "of Kishon" (see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 356, 339, 347; but see also Conder's 'Handbook,' p. 287, where a different view is taken).
