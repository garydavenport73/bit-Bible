To understand the questions set in motion by the last clause of the verse, comparison must be made of <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>. For anything that appears here, we should take for granted that Jehoram now first began to exercise any royal authority and enjoy any royal dignity. But the first of the just-quoted passages says Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded his wicked brother Ahaziah in the <span class="accented">second year</span> of Jehoram (of Judah), son of Jehoshaphat. In the second of the above-quoted passages, however, we are told that the same Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded to the throne in the <span class="accented">eighteenth</span> year of Jehoshaphat, which date tallies with our parallel of last chapter (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-41.htm">1 Kings 22:41</a>), to the effect that Jehoshaphat himself began to reign in Ahab's fourth year, and Ahaziah in Jeho-saphat's seventeenth year. While, lastly, the third of the above-quoted references says that in the fifth year of Joram (of Israel), "Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah" (which, however, is itself an unfaithful rendering of what must be a corrupt text), his son Jehoram "began to reign." It has therefore been conjectured that the royal name was given Jehoram (of Judah) by his father in his father's sixteenth year, and that in his twenty-third year he further invested him with some royal power (our ver. 3 gives some plausibility to this conjecture), from which last date Jehoram's "eight years" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>) must be reckoned; this was not less than two years before the death of Jehoshaphat. Were it not for the countenance that our third verse (describing the cut-and-dried arrangements that the father made for his sons) gives to the tenableness of the above conjectures, we should prefer the conjecture that the passages commented upon are so much corrupt text.

Nothing is known of the previous history of these six, now so cruelly murdered by their eldest brother. It will be observed that Jehoshaphat is styled King of Israel, probably merely generically. Into this way the writer of Chronicles would run, at any rate, more easily than the writer of Kings.

Jehoshaphat, nevertheless, was but following in the wake of the head of the separated kingdom of Judah, Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-22.htm">2 Chronicles 11:22, 23</a>), wherein he is said to have "dealt wisely;" even the parallel (in the matter of one son Abijah, sen of Maachah, the favourite wife, being appointed king) obtaining there in an aggravated form, as he was not the eldest son. This case, with those of Solomon and Jehoahaz (by the favour not of the parent but of the people, <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), formed the exceptions to the usual observance of and honour done to the principle of primogeniture (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>).

The parallel of <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17-21</a> may be consulted for our vers. 5-11; our vers. 11, 13 expound in clearer detail the "evil" that Jehoram wrought than the narrative of Kings.

The parallel, <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, reads, "to Zair." Of any such place nothing is known, and it has been proposed to supersede the word there by "Self," which a certain amount of similarity of the Hebrew characters might countenance. Possibly by some mishap, not so readily explainable by misoccurrence of characters simply, our words, "with his princes," should stand in place of "to Zair." It must be noted that the two first clauses of the verse in the parallel become something inconsequential (which is not the case with the reading of our text), in that it says, "The king and chariots went forth to a place, and rose up by night," etc. The dislocation is, perhaps, not serious, but our text avoids it in reading, "The king, princes, and chariots went forth, and rose up by night and smote," etc.

This noun does not occur very frequently, but is found in the following passages, viz.: <a href="../../par/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>. A note in Grove's interesting article, "Elijah" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' vol. 1. p. 580), says that the word is almost identical with the Arabic word of the present day, while the ordinary Hebrew word for a "letter" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> oftener rendered "book." <span class="cmt_word">There came</span>. That this is the precise language used rather helps the persuasion that it was the well-known Prophet Elijah of Israel, who, not resident in Judah, and perhaps very near the end of his life, and in sight of his translation, was taught and directed divinely to send this message of rebuke and terror for Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">Elijah</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> Some hold that it certainly was not the well-known prophet of the northern kingdom who is here intended. "Time, place, and circumstance," says Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, of Belfast ('Handbook to the Books of Chronicles,' p. 127), difference him "from the Tishbite." And he confidently considers him (with Cajetan) another Elijah (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-21.htm">Ezra 10:21</a>), or Eliah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>; for the form rendered so), or Eliyahu, in which form the Hebrew name appears (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, being the forms of the name found), on the grounds that the Tishbite was translated in the time of Jehoram's father Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>); that his sphere was in the northern kingdom, and himself more of one who wrought mighty works and spoke <span class="accented">otherwise</span> than as a prophet; and that the designation "the prophet" need by no means denote him exclusively. He adds that a "writing" from a prophet is nothing strange, which may be easily conceded but poorly instanced by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>; better by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1, 2, 6</a>. On the other hand, Grove (in article above quoted) and others find no invincible difficulty in accepting this Elijah for the famous prophet. His mention here is, of course, exceedingly interesting. as the only mention of him in Chro-nicles - a fact which very remarkably falls in with the abstinence as well as the fulness of the compiler of Chronicles. Josephus pronounces that the letter was sent during Elijah's life ('Ant.,' 9:05. &sect; 2), surmises to the contrary having been made. While Elijah's translation seems to have taken place before Jehoshaphat's death, from what we read of <span class="accented">Elisha</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>), we may well account that Elisha had begun his <span class="accented">ministry before</span> his master's translation. Not only the ether passages that confirm, but in especial the passage (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>) which tells of Jehoram's being, before his father's death, on the throne of Judah at the time of Elijah's interview with Ahaziah (a passage that occurs immediately preceding the account of Elijah's last acts), might have led us to suppose that Elijah's letter was before Jehoshaphat's death, during the joint reign, but for the mention of the slaying of his sons. Bertheau, in our text in his 'Chronik,' points out the resemblance which the "writing" shows to the matter of the speeches of Elijah, while in certain respects of style, and the very insulated sort of introduction it has here, it greatly differs from the narrative in which it is now set. Although the calculation may seem rather a fine one, the circumstances described accurately point to the "writing" of Elijah reaching Jehoram before the chronologically misplaced translation of Elijah as given in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-11</a>. This question may be instanced as one of the interesting moot points by no means compassed with insuperable difficulty, but challenging careful study and patient comparison of chronological and historical passages.

On account of the express mention of the camp in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>, some think that the slaughter and the plunder were all such as might have been wrought in the royal quarters <span class="accented">there</span>; others that we are to infer the taking by assault of Jerusalem itself and what was therein.

Two years' warning and space for repentance subsequent Jehoram had turned to no account, and even affliction and suffering brought him no 'amendment. No burning (see our note on 2 Chronicles 16:14).
