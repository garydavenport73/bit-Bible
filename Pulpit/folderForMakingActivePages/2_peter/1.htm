The same form of the name is found in <a href="../../par/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; it also occurs in <a href="../../par/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, where St. James refers to St. Peter's speech on the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians. It is the form always used in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament. The old man's thoughts go back to his early years; he describes himself by the familiar name of his youth; he uses that Greek form of it which was most distinctively Jewish. But he joins with the old name, which spoke of Judaism, the new name which the Lord Jesus had given him  - the name which describes him as a stone or rock, which indicates also his close connection with that Rock on which the Church is built, which is Christ. His names combine Hebrew and Greek, Jewish and Christian, associations. He is writing probably, as in his First Epistle, to Churches of mingled Jewish and Gentile elements. The first word of the Epistle supplies an argument for the genuineness of the Epistle. It is scarcely possible that an imitator, who was acquainted with the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>), and shows, as some say, so much anxiety to identify himself with the apostle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12-18</a>), would have announced himself by a name different from that used in the First Epistle, and would have adopted a form of the Hebrew name varying from that which occurs so frequently in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter, like St. Paul, describes himself as a servant, literally, "a slave," a bondman of Jesus Christ. We are not our own; we are bought with a price; we have work to do for our Master. St. Peter's work was that of a missionary, an apostle sent into the world to win souls for Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.</span> The word rendered "obtained" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means properly "to obtain by lot," as in <a href="../../par/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>. It is noticeable that one of the few places in which it occurs in the New Testament is in a speech of St. Peter's (<a href="../../par/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>); its use here implies that faith is a gift of God. The word for "like precious" equally precious) is found only here in the New Testament; it calls to our memory the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, and indicates a correspondence with the First Epistle. St. Peter addresses this Epistle simply to those who have obtained an equally precious faith "with us." By the last words he may mean himself only, or the apostles generally, or, possibly, all Jewish Christians. He is writing apparently to the same Churches to which his First Epistle was addressed (verse 16 and chapter 1 Peter 3:1); he says that their faith is equally precious with that of the apostles, or perhaps that the Gentiles have received the like precious gift with the chosen people. By "faith" he may mean the truths believed, as <a href="../../par/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>; or, more probably, faith in the subjective sense, the grace of faith, which receives those truths as a message from God (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> Some commentators, as Luther, Estius, etc., understand by "righteousness" in this place, the righteousness which God gives, as in <a href="../../par/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>, etc. But this seems unsuitable here; for faith is not given in righteousness, but rather righteousness in faith. Others take righteousness as the object of the faith - "to them that have Obtained faith in the righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are  enabled to believe in God's righteousness and to trust in it. This seems a forced interpretation. It is better to take the preposition as meaning "in the working of God's righteousness," in the sphere of its operation, and to understand "righteousness" as the attribute of God, his just and holy dealing with men. There is no respect of persons with God; in his righteousness he bestows the like precious faith on all who come to him, without distinction of race or country. According to the strict grammatical construction of the passage, "God" and "Saviour" are both predicates of "Jesus Christ," as in <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. The First and Second Persons of the blessed Trinity are distinguished in the following verse, and this has led several commentators to think that the same distinction should be made here. It is true that the absence of a second article does not make it absolutely certain that the two words "God" and "Saviour" must be taken as united under the one common article, and so regarded as two predicates of "Jesus Christ;" but it furnishes at least a very strong presumption in favour of this view, especially as there is not here, as there is in <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, any word like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to give definiteness to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Ellicott's note on Titus 2:13, and, on the other side, Alford's notes on both passages). The Lord Jesus is called "our Saviour" five times in this Epistle. The word does not occur in the First Epistle; but in St. Peter's speech (<a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>) the apostle declared to the Sanhedrin that God had exalted Jesus "to be a Prince and a Saviour." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-2.htm">2 Peter 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.</span> The order of the words in the Greek is the same as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>. The exact correspondence should be noticed. The writer of the Second Epistle, if not St. Peter himself, must have been attempting to imitate of set purpose the opening salutation of the First Epistle. Through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; rather, <span class="accented">in the knowledge.</span> The knowledge of God is the sphere in which grace and peace are communicated to the soul; they cannot be found outside that sphere. "Full knowledge" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may be regarded as the key-note of this Epistle, as "hope" is of the first. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; it means "knowledge" directed towards an object, gradually approaching nearer and nearer to it, concentrated upon it, fixed closely upon it. So it comes to mean the knowledge, not merely of intellectual apprehension, but rather of deep contemplation; the knowledge which implies love - for only love can concentrate continually the powers of the soul in close meditation upon its object. Comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, where, after saying in verse 8 that "knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) shall be done away," St. Paul continues, in verse 12, "Now I know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>) in part, but then I shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) even as also I am known (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)." He contrasts our present imperfect knowledge with the full knowledge which the blessed will have in heaven, and which God now has of us, using the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> of that fuller knowledge, as he had used <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the imperfect knowledge. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs several times in the Gospels, and is common in St. Paul's Epistles; it seems to imply a sort of protest against the knowledge that "puffeth up" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>), and especially against the knowledge "falsely so called" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>), which was claimed by the false teachers, who were the precursors of the coming Gnosticism (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). St. Peter had learned mere of the doings of these false teachers since he wrote the First Epistle, and this may perhaps be a reason for his frequent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the second. "Jesus our Lord" is a variation of the more common form, such as "the Lord Jesus;" it occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According as his Divine power;</span> better, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>, as in the Revised Version. The construction is the genitive absolute with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>. The words are to be closely connected with verse 2: "We need not fear, for God has given us all things that are necessary for our salvation; grace and peace will be multiplied unto us, if only we seek the knowledge of God." This is better than, with Huther and others, to make a full stop after verse 2, and to connect verses 3 and 4 closely with verse 5. The word for "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is unusual in the Greek Testament; it occurs only in two other places - verse 4 and <a href="../../par/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>. Hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hath granted.</span> St. Peter does not here use the ordinary verb for "to give," but one (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) which in the New Testament occurs only in this Epistle and in <a href="../../par/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>. "God hath given us all things for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) life," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all things necessary for life. By "life" St. Peter means the spiritual life of the soul; that life which consists in union with Christ, which is the life of Christ living in us. "Godliness" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is a word of the later apostolic age; besides this Epistle (in which it occurs four times) and a speech of St. Peter's in <a href="../../par/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, it is found only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles; it means reverence, true piety towards God. Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; literally,  <span class="accented">through the full knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of him that called us</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God. and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"). The best-supported reading seems to be that followed by the Revised Version, "By his own glory and virtue (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>)<span class="accented">."</span> Bengel says, "Ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quae dicuntur moralia; intime unum sunt utraque." All his glorious attributes make up his glory; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, virtue, is the energy, the activity of those attributes. The other reading, also well supported (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "through glory and virtue"), would mean nearly the same (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). God calls us through his attributes; his glorious perfections invite us, the revelation of those perfections calls us to his service. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, with one exception (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>), occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter's Epistles (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a> and 5). This <span class="accented">is</span>, so far, an argument in favour of identity of authorship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whereby he hath granted unto us h is precious and exceeding great promises.</span> Does the word "whereby" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things") refer to the immediately preceding words, "glory and virtue"? or is its antecedent to be found in the more distant "all things which pertain unto life and godliness"? Both views are possible. God first granted unto us all things necessary for life and godliness; through those first gifts, duly used, he has granted unto us others more precious still. But it <span class="accented">seems</span> better to connect the relative with the nearer antecedent. It is through God's glory and virtue, through his glorious attributes and the energetic working of those attributes, that he has granted the promises. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) should be translated "hath granted," as in the preceding verse. The word for "promise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs <span class="accented">elsewhere</span> only in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; it means the thing promised, not the act of promising. The order of the words, "exceeding great and precious," is differently given in the manuscripts; on the whole, that adopted by the Revised Version seems the best supported. The article with the first word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) has a possessive force, and is well rendered, "his precious promises." They are precious, because they will be certainly fulfilled in all their depth of blessed meaning, and because they are in part fulfilled at once (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>, "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance"). The word "precious" reminds us of <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 19</a>; the resemblance with <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> is apparent only, in the Authorized Version, not in the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">That by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that through these</span> (promises, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, through their fulfillment) <span class="accented">ye may beeome partakers.</span> It is true that the verb is aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), but it does not follow that, might be" is the right translation, or that the writer regarded the participation as having already taken place (comp. <a href="../../par/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>, "Believe in the light, that ye may be (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) the children of light"). As Alford says, the aorist seems to imply "that the aim was not the procedure, but the completion, of that indicated; not the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the carrying on the process, but the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, its accomplishment." The end of God's gift is the complete accomplishment of his gracious purpose, but it is only by continual growth that the Christian attains at length to that accomplishment. St. Peter's words seem very bold; but they do not go beyond many other statements of Holy Scripture. At the beginning God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." St. Paul tells us that believers are now "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-49.htm">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>, etc.). Christians, born of God (<a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>), are made "partakers of Christ" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>), "partakers of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>). Christ prayed for us that we might be "made perfect in one" with himself who is one with God the Father, through the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost the Comforter (<a href="../../par/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17, 23</a>). The second person is used to imply that the promises made to all Christians (unto <span class="accented">us</span>) belong to those whom St. Peter now addresses. <span class="cmt_word">Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust;</span> literally, <span class="accented">having escaped from the corruption that is in the world in lust.</span> These words express the negative side of the Christian life, the former clause describing its active and positive side. God's precious promises realized in the soul enable the Christian to become partakers of the Divine nature, and to escape from corruption; the two aspects of the Christian life must go on simultaneously; each implies and requires the other. Bengel says, "Haec fuga non tam ut officium nostrum, quam ut beneficium divinum, communionem cum Deo comitans, hoc loco ponitur." The verb used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only in this Epistle. It reminds us of St. Paul's words in <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>, "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption." The corruption or destruction  (for the Word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> has both those meanings) from which we must escape has its seat and power in lust; working secretly in the lusts of men's wicked hearts, it manifests its evil presence in the world (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And beside this, giving all diligence;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but for this very cause also.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is frequently used in this sense in classical Greek, but in the New Testament only here. It refers back to the last verse. God's precious gifts and promises should stimulate us to earnest effort. The verb rendered "giving" means literally "bringing in by the side;" it is one of those graphic and picturesque expressions which are characteristic of St. Peter's style. God worketh within us both to will and to do; this (both St. Paul and St. Peter teach us) is a reason, not for remissness, but for increased exertion. God's grace is sufficient for us; without that we can do nothing; but by the side (so to speak) of that grace, along with it, we must bring into play all earnestness, we must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. The word seems to imply that the work is God's work; we can do very little indeed, but that very little we must do, and for the very reason that God is working in us. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Add to your faith virtue;</span> literally, <span class="accented">supply in your faith.</span> He does not say, "supply faith;" he assumes the existence of faith. "He that cometh unto God must believe." The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) means properly to "contribute to the expenses of a chorus;" it is used three times by St. Paul, and, in its simple form, by St. Peter in his First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). In usage it came to mean simply to "supply or provide," the thought of the chorus being dropped. So we cannot be sure that the idea of faith as leading the mystic dance in the chorus of Christian graces was present to St. Peter's mind, especially as the word occurs again in verse 11, where no such allusion is possible. The fruits of faith are in the faith which produces them, as a tree is in its seed; they must be developed out of faith, as faith expands and energizes; in the exercise of each grace a fresh grace must issue forth. Virtue is well described by Bengel as "strenuus animi tonus et vigor;" it is Christian manliness and active courage in the good fight of faith. The word "virtue" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>), with the exception of <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter - in this chapter three times, and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, thus forming one of the kinks between the two Epistles. <span class="cmt_word">And to virtue knowledge.</span> St. Peter here uses the simple word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, discretion, a right understanding, "quae malam a bono secernit, et mali fugam docet" (Bengel). This practical knowledge is gained in the manly self-denying activities of the Christian life, and leads on to the fuller knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ (verse 8).

This self-control extends over the whole of life, and consists in the government of all the appetites; it must be learned in the exercise of that practical knowledge which discerns between good and evil. True knowledge leads on to self-control, to that perfect freedom which consists in the service of God; not to that liberty promised by the false teachers, which is licentiousness. <span class="cmt_word">And to temperance patience; and to patience godliness.</span> The practice of self-control will result in patient endurance; but that endurance will not be mere stoicism; it will be a conscious submission of our human will to the holy will of God, and so will tend to develop and strengthen <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, reverence and piety towards God (see note on verse 3).

"In your godliness," St. Peter says, "ye must develop brotherly kindness, the unfeigned love of the brethren;" for "every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him" (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>). And as God is loving unto every man, and "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," so Christians, who are taught to be followers (imitators) of God (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>), must learn in the exercise of love toward the brethren that larger love which embraces all men in an ever-widening circle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Thus love, the greatest of all Christian graces (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), is the climax in St. Peter's list. Out of faith, the root, spring the seven fair fruits of holiness, of which holy love is the fairest and the sweetest (comp. Ignatius, 'Ad Ephes.,' 14. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>). No grace can remain alone; each grace, as it is gradually formed in the soul, tends to develop and strengthen others; all graces meet in that highest grace of charity, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before God. Bengel says well, "Praeseus quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit, subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit."

Here we know only in part, we see through a glass darkly; but that imperfect knowledge should be ever growing, increasing in fullness and distinctness (see chapter 2 Peter 3:18). The various graces of the Christian character, realized in the heart, will lead us on towards that fuller knowledge of Christ; if they are really ours, they will not allow us to be idle, they must bring forth the fruit of good works; and the life of righteousness by faith draws the Christian onwards in the knowledge of Christ: we learn to knew him by following him (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).

Such a man can only see the things which lie close around him - earth and earthly things; he cannot lift up his eyes by faith and behold "the land that is very far off;" he cannot "see the King in his beauty" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). The word for "short-sighted" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins; literally, <span class="accented">having incurred forgetfulness of the cleansing from his old sins.</span> St. Peter is apparently thinking of the one baptism for the remission of sin. Ananias had said to Saul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins" (<a href="../../par/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>); St. Peter himself had said, in his first great sermon, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Those who do not realize in the religious life that death unto sin of which holy baptism is the sign and the beginning, incur forgetfulness of the cleansing from sin which they then received; they do not use the grace once given for the attainment of those higher graces of which St. Peter has been speaking. The one talent once entrusted to them must be taken from them; they are idle and unfruitful, and cannot reach unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "give diligence," recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "all diligence," of verse 5. The aorist seems, as it were, to sum up the continued diligence of daily life into one vivid description. This is the only place in which St. Peter uses the vocative "brethren;" he has "beloved" in the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>) and in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8</a>. Both words imply affectionate exhortation. Two ancient manuscripts, the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic, insert here, "Through your good works (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">To make your calling and election sure.</span> Alford calls attention to the middle voice of the verb, "Not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which lay beyond their power, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, on their side, for their part. But the verb must not be explained away into a pure subjectivity, 'to make sure to yourselves;' it carries the reflexive force, but only in so far as the act is and must be done for and <span class="accented">quoad</span> a man's own self, the absolute and final determination resting with Another." The calling and election are the act of God (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). All the baptized, all who bear the name of Christ, are called into the Church, but few comparatively are chosen, elect (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>). We look, as it were, from far below up to the mysteries of God's sovereign government; we cannot read the list of blessed names written in the Lamb's book of life; we cannot lift ourselves to a point high enough to comprehend the secrets of God's dealing with mankind, and to reconcile the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence with the free agency of man. But we feel the energy of that free agency within us; we know that Holy Scripture bids us to work out our salvation, and tells us of some who receive the grace of God in vain (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>), or frustrate the grace of God (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>); and we feel that when  the apostle tells us to make our calling and election sure, he means that we must try to realize that calling and election, to bring its solemn responsibilities and its blessed hopes to bear upon our daily life, to live as men who have been called into God's Church, who are elect unto eternal life, and so (if we may dare to say it) to ratify God's election by our poor acceptance. He calls us into covenant with himself; we answer, as the children of Israel said at Mount Sinai, "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>). Our obedience makes the covenant sure to us; holiness of life is the proof of God's election, for it implies the indwelling presence of "that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." <span class="cmt_word">For if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</span> "If ye do these things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "If ye make your calling and election sure." "The plural shows that the apostle considered this making sure a very many-sided act" (Dietlein, in Huther). Others refer the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "these things," to the graces just enumerated. <span class="accented">Ye shall never fall</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ye shall never stumble</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to strike one's foot against some obstacle," and so to stumble. St. James says, "In many things we offend (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) all" (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). St. Peter here means to stumble so as to fall (<a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); while Christians "do these things," while they make their calling and election sure by holiness of life, they cannot stumble; it is in unguarded moments that they fall into temptation.

Compare the use of the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, speaks, like St. Peter here, of <span class="accented">putting off a</span> tabernacle or tent as we talk of putting off a garment.   Alford quotes Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:08. 2, where Moses says, "Since I must depart from life, I have thought it right not even now to lay aside my zeal for your happiness." The word used here for "putting off" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is one of the links between the two Epistles; it occurs also in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me;</span> better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">signified unto me.</span> The aorist points to a definite time. St. Peter is thinking of our Lord's prophecy, which St. John afterwards recorded (<a href="../../par/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>); he could never forget that touching interview; he had already referred to it once in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>.

St. Peter will not only stir up the minds of his readers during his life, but he will give diligence to enable them to call to remembrance, after his death, the truths which he had preached. These words may refer simply to the present Epistle; but it seems more natural to understand them of an intention to commit to writing the facts of the gospel history; if this be so, we have here a confirmation of the ancient tradition that the Second Gospel was written by St. Mark at the dictation of St. Peter. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is that used in verse 10, and should be translated in the same way; they must give diligence to make their calling and election sure. St. Peter, for his part, will give diligence to furnish them with a lasting record of the truths of Christianity. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, at every time, whenever there may be need, occurs only here in the New Testament. (For <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "to be able," compare the Greek of <a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>.) It is remarkable that we have here, in two consecutive verses, two words which remind us of the history of the Transfiguration, "tabernacle," and "decease" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; see <a href="../../par/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). Then Peter proposed to make three tabernacles; then he heard Moses and Elijah speaking of the Lord's decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. The simple unconscious occurrence of these coincidences is a strong proof of the genuineness of our Epistle; it is inconceivable that an imitator of the second century should have shown this delicate skill in adapting his production to the circumstances of the supposed writer. The last words of the verse may mean (and in classical Greek would mean) "to make mention of these things;" but the usual rendering seems more suitable here. St. Peter was anxious rather that his readers should have the truths of the gospel living in their memories, than that they should talk about them; that would follow as a matter of course: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Some Roman Catholic commentators think that this passage contains a promise that the apostle would still, after his death, continue to remember the needs of the Church on earth, and to help them by his intercessions; but this interpretation involves a complete dislocation of clauses, and cannot possibly be the true meaning of the words.

This compound verb is used only by St. Peter in the New Testament; we find it again in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a> and 15. Bengel and others have thought that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, from or out of, implies wandering from the truth after false guides; but probably the word merely means "to follow closely," though in this case the guides were going astray. Perhaps the use of the plural number is accounted for by the fact that St. Peter was not the only witness of the glory of the Transfiguration; he associates in thought his two brother-apostles with himself. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, fables, with this exception, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles. There is a remarkable parallel in the procemium of the 'Antiquities' of Josephus, sect. 4, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter may be referring to the "Jewish fables" mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>), or to the stories about the heathen gods such as those in Hesiod and Ovid, or possibly to some early inventions, such as those ascribed to Simon the Sorcerer, which were afterwards to be developed into the strange fictions of Gnosticism (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>). The word rendered "cunningly devised" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; but there a different part of the verb is used, and in a different sense. <span class="cmt_word">When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter can scarcely be referring to St. Paul or other missionaries, as the following words identify the preachers with the witnesses of the Transfiguration; he must be alluding either to his First Epistle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>), or to personal teaching of his which has not been recorded, or, just possibly, to the Gospel of St. Mark. St. Peter had seen the power of the Lord Jesus manifested in his miracles; he had heard the announcement  of the risen Saviour, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" he had, like the rest of the apostles, been "endued with power from on high." By the coming (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) he must mean the second advent, the invariable meaning of the word in Holy Scripture (see chapter 2 Peter 3:4, <a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> The word for "eye-witnesses" is not the common one (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, used by St. <a href="../../par/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>), but a technical word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which in classical Greek designates the highest class of those who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. The choice of such a word may possibly imply that St. Peter regarded himself and his brother-apostles as having received the highest initiation into the mysteries of religion. The noun is found only here in the New Testament; but the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a> and 1 Pet 3:2, and in no other of the New Testament writers. Here again we have an undesigned coincidence which points to identity of authorship. The word for "majesty" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in St. Luke's description of the healing of the demoniac boy immediately after the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>), and elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he received from God the Father honour and glory.</span> The construction here is interrupted; the literal translation is, "Having received," etc., and there is no verb to complete the sense. Winer supposes that the apostle had intended to continue with some such words as, "He had us for witnesses," or, "He was declared to be the beloved Son of God," and that the construction was interrupted by the direct quotation of the words spoken by the voice from heaven ('Grammar,' 3:45, b). (For a similar anacoluthon, see in the Greek <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>.) "Honour" seems to refer to the testimony of the voice from heaven; "glory," to the splendour of the Lord's transfigured Person. <span class="cmt_word">When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">when such a voice was borne to him.</span> The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of "the <span class="accented">rushing</span> mighty wind" which announced the coming of the Holy Ghost; and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> of "the grace which is being brought." It is repeated in the next verse. It seems intended to assert emphatically the real objective character of the voice. It was not a vision, a dream; the voice was borne from heaven; the apostles heard it with their ears. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> must be rendered "by," not "from." The "excellent" (rather, "majestic," or "magnificent") glory was the Shechinah, the visible manifestation of the presence of God, which had appeared in ancient times on Mount Sinai, and in the tabernacle and temple above the mercy-seat. God was there; it was he who spoke. For the word rendered "excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) compare the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the Majestic One of the firmament;" where our Authorized Version gives a more exact translation of the Hebrew, "in his excellency on the sky" (see also the 'Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,' chapter 9, where the occurrence of the same remarkable words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, suggests that Clement must have been acquainted with this Epistle). This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Our translation makes these words correspond exactly with the report given by St. Matthew in his account of the Transfiguration, except that "hear ye him" is added there. In the Greek there are some slight variations. According to one ancient manuscript (the Vatican), the order of the words is different, and there is a second pen, "This is my Son, my Beloved." All uncial manuscripts have here, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> of St. Matthew's Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. The difference cannot be represented in our translation. The construction is pregnant, and the meaning is that from all eternity the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the good pleasure, of God the Father was directed towards the Divine Son, and still abideth on him. The same truth seems to be implied in the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"). An imitator of the second century would certainly have made this quotation to correspond exactly with the words as given in one of the synoptic Gospels.

Mount Horeb was "holy ground," because God appeared there to Moses, because it was the scene of the giving of the Law. Mount Zion was a holy hill, because God had chosen it to be a habitation for himself; the Mount of the Transfiguration was holy, because there God the Son manifested forth his glory. God hallows every place which he pleases to make the scene of his revealed presence. This whole passage shows the deep and  lasting impression which the Transfiguration made on those who were privileged to witness it (comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have also a more sure word of prophecy;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and we have the word of prophecy made more sure</span>; or, <span class="accented">we have the word of prophecy more sure</span> (than the testimony of the heavenly voice). The rendering of the Authorized Version is ungrammatical; we must adopt one of the other modes of representing the original. The second seems to be preferred by most commentators. Thus Archdeacon Farrar, translating the passage, "And still stronger is the surety we have in the prophetic word," adds in a note, "Why more sure? Because wider in its range, and more varied, and coming from many, and bringing a more intense personal conviction than the testimony to a single fact." But when St. Peter applied the epithet "surer" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to the word of prophecy, does he mean in his own estimate of it, or in that of others? If he is speaking of himself, it is surely inconceivable that any possible testimony to the truth of the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ could be comparable with the commanding authority of the Divine voice which he himself had heard borne from heaven, and the transcendent glory which he himself had seen flashing from the Saviour's human form and bathing it in an aureole of celestial light. That heavenly voice had made the deepest possible impression on the apostles. "They fell on their faces," as Moses had done under the like circumstances, recognizing it as the voice of God. Peter had said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here;" and evidently all through his life he felt that it was good for him to dwell in solemn thought on the treasured memories of that august revelation. No written testimony could be "surer" to St. Peter than that voice from heaven. But is he rather thinking of the confirmation of the faith of his readers? He is still using the first person plural, as in verses 16 and 18; in this verse, indeed, he passes to the second; but the retaining of the first person in the first clause of the verse shows that, if he is not still speaking of apostles only, he at least includes himself among those who have the word of prophecy; and to him certainly the testimony of that word, though sacred and precious, could not be "surer" than the testimony of the heavenly voice. To Jewish Christians the evidence of the prophets of the Old Testament was of supreme importance. Nathanael, the "Israelite indeed," was drawn to the Lord by the assurance that, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, did write." The Lord himself insisted again and again upon the testimony of the prophets; so did his apostles after him. Still, it seems difficult to understand that, even to Jewish Christians, the testimony of the prophets, however sacred and weighty, could be surer than that of those apostles who made known the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, having been eye-witnesses of his majesty; while to Gentile Christians the testimony of those apostles of the Lamb who declared "what they had heard, what they had seen with their eyes, what their hands had handled, of the Word of life," must have had greater power to convince than the predictions of the Hebrew prophets, though these predictions, fulfilled as they were in the Lord Jesus, furnish subsidiary evidence of exceeding value. On the whole, the more probable meaning of St. Peter seems to be that the word of prophecy was made more sure to himself, and, through his teaching, to others by the overwhelming testimony of the voice from heaven and the glory of the Transfiguration. He had become a disciple long before. His brother Andrew had first told him that Jesus was the Messiah; he himself, a week before the Transfiguration, had confessed him solemnly to be "the Christ, the Son of the living God? But the Transfiguration deepened that faith into the most intense conviction; it made the word of prophecy which spoke of Christ surer and more certain. It is not without interest that the writer of the so-called 'Second Epistle of Clement' quotes (chapter 11) from "the prophetic word" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), passages which resemble <a href="../../par/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> and <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. There is a parallel to the first clause of this in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 11:6, 12; to the second in 2 Esdr. 12:42. The word rendered "light" is rather a lamp or torch; our Lord uses it of John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). The word translated "dark" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is found only here in the New Testament; it means "dry, parched, and so squalid, desert;" there seems to be no sufficient authority for the rendering "dark." God's Word is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path; the word of prophecy guides us to Christ. Until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts; literally, <span class="accented">until day dawn through</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "through the gloom." There is no article. The word for "day-star" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>v, lucifer, light-bringer) is found in no other place of the New Testament; but comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>. St. Peter seems to mean that the prophetic word, rendered more sure to the apostles by the voice from heaven, and to Christians generally by apostolic witness, shines like a guiding   lamp, till the fuller light of day dawns upon the soul, as the believer, led by the prophetic word, realizes the personal knowledge of the Lord, and he manifests himself according to his blessed promises to the heart that longs for his sacred presence. He is the Bright and Morning Star, the Day-star, the Light-bringer; for he is the Light of the world - he brings the light, the full light of day. The prophetic word is precious; it sheds light upon the surrounding darkness  - the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of the heart that knows not Christ; but its light is as the light of a torch or a lamp, compared with the pervading daylight which the felt presence of Christ sheds into those hearts into which God hath shined to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>). Some understand "day" here of the great day of the Lord. Against this interpretation is the absence of the article, and the fact that the last words of the verse seem to give a subjective meaning to the passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.</span> By "knowing this first" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is meant that we must recognize this truth as of primary importance, or, before we commence the study of prophecy; the phrase occurs again in chapter 2 Peter 3:3. The literal translation of the following clause is, "that all prophecy of Scripture [there is no article] is not; all...  not" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>) being a common Hebraism for none, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but the verb is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "is," but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "becomes, arises, comes into being." The word for "private" is <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "special," or commonly, "one's own" (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5</a>; chapter 2 Peter 2:16, 22; 3:3, 16, 17). The word rendered "interpretation" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is found nowhere else in the New Testament; the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="../../par/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>, "He expounded all things;" and <a href="../../par/acts/19-39.htm">Acts 19:39</a>, "It shall be determined or settled." These considerations, strengthened by the context, seem to guide us to the following explanation: No prophecy of Scripture arises from the prophet's own interpretation of the vision presented to his mind; for it was from God that the prophecy was brought, and men spoke as they were borne on by the Holy Spirit. This view of the passage is also supported by the remarkable parallel in the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>). The prophets searched diligently into the meaning of the revelation vouchsafed to them; they did not always comprehend it in all its details; they could not interpret it to themselves; the written prophecy arose out of the interpretation of the revelation supplied by the same Spirit from whom the revelation itself proceeded. Therefore the prophetic books of Holy Scripture are sacred and precious, and we do well in giving heed to them; though the day-star of the Lord's own presence, shining in the illuminated heart, is holier still. Other views of this difficult passage are: Prophecy is not its own interpreter; the guidance of the Spirit is necessary. Or, prophecy is not a matter for the private interpretation of the readers; only the Holy Spirit can explain it. But the explanation adopted seems most accordant with the Greek words and with the general sense of the context (compare St. Paul's teaching in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). The gifts of the Spirit are divided as he will; to one man are given "divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues." Not every one, it seems, who had the first gift, had also the latter. Tongues and the interpretation of tongues were two distinct gifts. It may be so with prophecy and the interpretation of prophecy.

We have again the same verb, "being borne on" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/acts/27-15.htm">Acts 27:15, 17</a>, where it is used of a ship being borne on by the wind. So the prophets were borne on in their prophetic utterance by the Holy Spirit of God. They were truly and really inspired. The mode of that inspiration is not explained; perhaps it cannot be made plain to our human understanding; all the points of contact between the finite and the Infinite are involved in mystery. But the fact is clearly revealed - the prophets were borne on by the Holy Spirit of God. This is not, as some have fancied, the language of Montanism. Prophecy is but a lamp shining in a dark place; it is not the day-star. Prophecy came not by the will of man; the prophets were moved or borne on by the Holy Ghost. But St. Peter does not say that their human consciousness was suspended, or that they were passive as the lyre when swept by the plectrum. Had this passage been written after the rise of Montanism early in the second century, the writer, if a Montanist, would have said more; if not a Montanist, he would have carefully guarded his words from possible misunderstanding.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_peter/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Peter 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Peter 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_peter/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Peter 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Peter 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
