The word for "strongholds" is found here alone. These "fortresses" were the opposition aroused by factious and hostile partisans, and he hoped to subdue them by the strong exercise of apostolic authority (l Corinthians 4:21; 5:1-5). Dean Stanley suggests a reminiscence of the hundred and twenty <span class="accented">Cilician</span> fortresses pulled down by Pompey; but I think that these general allusions are often pressed too far.

This he proceeds to prove by the fact that he was the founder of their Church (vers. 13-18); that he had always acted with absolute disinterestedness (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-1.htm">2 Corinthians 11:1-15</a>); that he had lived a life of toil and suffering (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21-33</a>), and that he had received special revelations from God (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-6</a>).

The fact that a word could thus possess and dominate over his style and imagination shows how deeply he was moved. The Corinthian Church, with its inflated factions and their fuglemen, recked with beasting, and St. Paul is driven, with utter distaste, to adopt in self-defence language which, to the uncandid and indiscriminating, might seem to wear the same aspect. The word, which is unfrequent in other Epistles, occurs eighteen times in these chapters alone. Other haunting words are "tolerate," "bear with" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>:l, 4, 19, 20), and "senseless," "fool" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-16.htm">2 Corinthians 11:16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-6.htm">2 Corinthians 12:6, 11</a>); see note on 2 Corinthians 1:3. <span class="cmt_word">Somewhat more</span>; <span class="accented">something more abundantly</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For edification, and not for your destruction;</span> <span class="accented">for building you up, not pulling you down</span>.

The phrase may, indeed, imply "it is said" (<span class="accented">on dit</span>); but it may refer to one main critic and opponent (comp. vers. 7, 11). Perhaps it would have been wiser and kinder if no one had reported to St. Paul all these subterranean calumnies and innuendoes. <span class="cmt_word">Weighty and strong.</span> This could not be denied, considering the immense effect which had been produced by his first letter (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His bodily presence is weak.</span> This is usually taken to mean that St. Paul's personal appearance was unprepossessing  (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>). This, indeed, we should infer from many other passages (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>:34; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>), and as a natural result of his "stake in the flesh." It is, too, the consistent though late tradition respecting him (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:628). Here, however, the words may mean no more than that "he adds nothing to his cause by being present in person, since he shows vacillation and want of energy." <span class="cmt_word">Contemptible</span>; rather, <span class="accented">despised</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3, 4</a>).

The reading, however, of the Authorized Version is undoubtedly right, and most probably the rendering also. The meaning is that the little cliques of factious religionists, never looking outside their own narrow circles, became inflated with a sense of importance which would have been annihilated if they had looked at higher standards. Hence they thought themselves at liberty to intrude and lay down the law and usurp a claim to infallibility which there was nothing to justify. Such conduct is the reverse of wise. It is a mixture of selfishness, Pharisaism, and conceit, and there have been abundant examples of it among religious parties in all ages. St. Paul, on the other hand, keeps within his own measure, because he has learnt to adopt larger and loftier standards.
