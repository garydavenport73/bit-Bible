It explains why the captain of the Lord's host appeared unto Joshua. The inhabitants of Jericho, though in a state of the utmost alarm, were nevertheless fully on their guard against the children of Israel. The commencement of hostilities imposed a great responsibility on Joshua. Success at the outset was, humanly speaking, indispensable. We may see what defeat involved for him by his distress in consequence of the check at Ai. The alternative was victory or annihilation, for the Israelites had no homes or fortresses to which they could retire. Joshua was therefore encouraged by a visible proof that he was under the protection of the Most High, to be yet farther assured by the marvels that were to follow. The use of the Pual participle with its fullest intensive sense, to strengthen the affirmation of the action by the Kal, is a singular construction. Literally rendered it is "shutting and closely shut up," thus including <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the act of closing, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the continuance of that act, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (LXX.), "clausa at que munita" (Vulg.). So also the Chaldea paraphrase. The remainder of the verse strengthens still more the assertion of the state of siege. The king of Jericho, such was his alarm, regarded his city as a beleaguered one, from the mere presence of Joshua and his host in its vicinity.

The LXX., which Calvin and our translators and the majority of commentators follow, regard this part of the sentence as stating what was to be done on the six days, and rightly so, as vers. 8-14 clearly show. That the historian, as has been before remarked, did not always give the full instructions Joshua received is evident from this passage. The priests are not said to have been instructed to sound the trumpet on the six days; yet we learn from Joshua 5:13 that they did so. It is rather implied than expressed that the ark was also to be borne in procession; but that this was (lone is evident from ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Seven trumpets of rams' horns.</span> There is no mention of rams' horns in the original, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> trumpets of jubilee, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of  triumph (hardly as Gesenius, "alarm trumpets," though not necessarily, with Dr. Vaughan in his 'Heroes of Faith,' "the emblems of festival, not of warfare"). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is derived from the same root as the Latin is in the phrase Io Triumphe (cf. Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;</span>), and according to Gesenius our word "yule" is also derived from this root. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> as the next verse shows, was a curved instrument, in shape like a ram's horn, though not necessarily of that material; whereas the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> was a straight trumpet. <span class="cmt_word">Seven times.</span> The importance of the number seven as indicative of completeness is here strongly indicated. Seven priests were to carry seven trumpets for seven days. The word for to swear, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> literally to be <span class="accented">sevened</span>, means to have one's vow consecrated and confirmed by seven sacrifices or seven witnesses (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21-28.htm">Genesis 21:28, 30</a>). The number seven, says Bahr in his 'Symbolik des Alten Testament,' 1, 187, 188, is the sign of the relation, union, communion between God and the world, as represented by the number three and four respectively, just as twelve is in another relation (see note on Joshua 21:3). Its meaning, according to Bahr, among the heathen is somewhat different. There it means the harmony of the universe, and is signified by the seven stars, to which, and neither more nor less, was the power of influencing man's destiny ascribed. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</span> "Fac tibi tribas ductiles, si sacerdos es, immo, quia sacerdos es (gens enim regalis effectus es et sacerdotium sanctum, de te enim scripture est), fac tibi tribas ductiles ex Scripturis sanctis" (Orig., Hom. 7 on Joshua).

Here the word used is <span class="accented">horn of jubilee</span>, but not necessarily of <span class="accented">ram's</span> horn, as our version, any more than the modern <span class="accented">horn</span>, though it takes the place of the more primitive instrument made of that material, must itself be a ram's horn. So Rosenmuller. The word. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> in Hebrew is used in different senses, all, however, growing out of the one original sense. Thus it is used for a <span class="accented">musical instrument</span>, for <span class="accented">rays of light</span>, for the <span class="accented">projections extending from the corners of the altar</span>, and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, for a <span class="accented">mountain peak</span> (like the German Schreekhorn, Gabelhorn, Weisshorn).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is armed,</span> or rather <span class="accented">disencumbered, i.e.</span>, prepared for battle (see <a href="../../par/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>). Similarly, in the next verse, "the armed men," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the host in marching order, as we say. Kimchi and Jarchi refer this to the Reubenites and their brethren, but without sufficient authority. Keil thinks that it was impossible that the unarmed people would have gone with the procession as "the rereward" (see note on Joshua 5:13), because no command to that effect is given in ver. 3. But as he has told us in <a href="../../par/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3, 4</a>, and as we have just seen in ver. 4. the command to Joshua is <span class="accented">not</span> fully given. A short abstract of it is given, and it is to be filled up in detail from the subsequent narrative. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, <i>the priests</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</div><div class="comm">

The people of Jericho knew only too well what this religious procession meant. As a military manoeuvre (so Calvin) it was worse than useless, it was ridiculous. It actually invited attack; nay, it afforded, if the interpretation in the note on ver. 8 be correct, an admirable opportunity for the slaughter of defenceless women and children by a sudden sally from the city. But the history of the Exodus was not unknown to the king and people of Jericho. The inspired law giver, with his miraculous powers, and his claim to direct intercourse with the Most High, was a personage only too well known to them, and his mission was only too sure a token of the Divine sanction which rested on their proceedings. His supernatural qualifications had evidently descended to his successor, and now it was terribly clear that this awful silent march, with the army equipped for battle, but not attempting to engage in it, the seven priests with their seven trumpets, the visible symbol of the Presence of the God of Israel, attended by the awestruck multitude awaiting the Divine pleasure, was but the prelude to some new interposition from on high, the mysterious foreshadowing of some hitherto unheard of calamity which should befall the devoted city. There seems in this narrative no choice between rejecting the whole as an absurd fable, or accepting it as the record of a "notable miracle." The account is minute in its detail. The historian, if he be an historian, is distinctly impressed with the idea that he is relating a miracle. The obvious course for Joshua, if he were not relying on supernatural aid, was either to assault or to blockade the city. To perambulate it for days in the expectation of some convulsion of nature such as, we are told, frequently happened in that volcanic region, would have been the extreme of childish folly, and quite contrary to that common sense and military skill with which, as we have seen, Joshua undoubtedly was endowed. If he were possessed, seven days beforehand, with a conviction that an earthquake were imminent, such a persuasion would be of itself miraculous. <span class="accented">Paulus'</span> idea of a mine having been sprung is still less compatible with our narrative. Von Lengerke, in his 'Cana supposes that the astonishing success of the Israelites grew into a wonder in the hands of the narrator. But this involves the entire falsehood, not only of the command given to Joshua by Jehovah, but of the seven days' perambulation of Jericho, and the remaining incidents of the siege, a theory not easily reconcilable with the minute accuracy of detail displayed throughout the narrative. The seven days' circuit of Jericho must, therefore, either be denied altogether, in spite of the numerous evidences of genuineness which meet us in the narrative; or, if explained, the only explanation which is consistent with the fact is, that Joshua had received an intimation that he was not to expect to effect the reduction of the city by natural means, but was to wait patiently for an interposition from on high.

This ban was the most solemn and tremendous religious sentence, the absolute and final excommunication of the old law. The sin of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.) was the sparing of anything whatever in the city which had been laid under the ban - a ban which Saul had been specially commanded to execute (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>) according to the principles laid down in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. When Keil, however, states that the ban "could never be pronounced upon things and property alone, but only upon open idolaters, either with or without their possessions," he appears to have overlooked <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-16.htm">Leviticus 27:16-21</a>, where a man may devote irredeemably to God property of <span class="accented">his own</span> (cf. ver. 28 of the same chapter). In his subsequent work, however, Keil qualifies this assertion by a consideration of this very passage. Idolatrous worship was the one thing which justified the Israelites in laying one of their own cities under the ban (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a> 18, above cited). But (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>) it had been pronounced against the Canaanites. Property, how. ever, save in the case of Jericho, seems to have been exempted from the ban (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Even at Jericho the silver and the gold, the brass and the iron, were placed in the treasury of the Lord (Joshua 5:19, 24). "Why," says Theodoret, "was the city thus devoted?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-22.htm">Joshua 6:22</a></div><div class="verse">But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Had said.</span> Here we have an instance of the use of the perfect as a pluperfect. We can hardly suppose, as Keil observes, that Joshua gave these orders in the midst of the turmoil and confusion attendant on the sack of the city (see above, <a href="../../par/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Go into the harlot's house.</span> The preservation of Rahab's house must have been a part of the miracle, since it was upon the city wall (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-30.htm">Hebrews 11:30, 31</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-23.htm">Joshua 6:23</a></div><div class="verse">And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brought out.</span> Therefore the medieval legends concerning Rahab's house must be classed among superstitious fables. Rahab and her family and relations were saved, but her house shared the destruction which befel the rest of the city. Origen cites in reference to the deliverance of Rahab the harlot, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, and <a href="../../par/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Without the camp of Israel.</span> Not in the <span class="accented">camp of Israel outside the city</span>, as some have rendered.

For a fuller discussion of the bearing of this passage on the date of the Book of Joshua, see Introduction. There is no mention of Rahab's marriage in the Old Testament. Lightfoot ('Hebrew and Talmudicai Exercitations?' <a href="../../par/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) mentions a tradition that she married <span class="accented">Joshua!</span> Dr. W. H. Mill, in his treatise on the genealogies of our Lord, defends the tradition St. Matthew has followed by showing that Salmon's age at the time gives immense probability to the statement. Some (see the Bishop of Bath and Wells' article in Smith's ' Dictionary of the Bible') suppose that Salmon was one of the spies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua adjured <i>them</i> at that time, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest <i>son</i> shall he set up the gates of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua adjured them</span>. Caused them to swear, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, bound them by an oath, as the Hiphil implies here. This was the strict meaning of "adjure" at the time our version was made (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>). But it had also the less definite meaning which it now has, of solemnly warning a person to do something or to leave it undone (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-16.htm">1 Kings 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). The object of this solemn adjuration (see above) was to preserve Jericho as a spot devoted to God for ever; and for this reason a curse was pronounced upon any one who should attempt to found a city upon the devoted spot (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>, "It shall not be rebuilt.") This curse actually fell on the reckless Hiel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>; cf. Josephus, 'Antiq.,' V. 1:8), and he saw the laying of its foundations marked by the death of his eldest son, while the death of his youngest followed its completion. It does not seem that it was forbidden to build habitations on the spot, far Jericho is frequently <span class="accented">mentioned</span> in the New Testament, and the house of Zacchaeus (<a href="../../par/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) was there. What seems to have been forbidden was the erection of a fortified city there (see Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 214). The mention of Jericho in ch. 18:21 does not imply that it was an inhabited city, but simply that the site of Jericho fell within the border of the tribe of Benjamin. For Jerusalem is also mentioned, and we know that it did not become theirs until the time of David. Whether the "city of palm trees" (<a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>) is Jericho, may be questioned. But in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a> express mention is made of Jericho, the last time as the site of the school of the prophets. Some commentators have endeavoured to restrict the sense of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> used here to the building of fortifications. But this is unduly to restrict its meaning, for it is constantly used also of houses and altars (see <a href="../../par/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). But the mention of gates clearly implies a fortified city. Commentators cite as parallel instances the curse of Agamemnon on Troy, of Croesus on Sidene (so Grotius from Strabo, lib. 13 de Ilio), and of Scipio upon Carthage, and it is observed that when Augustus rebuilt Carthage he carefully avoided the old site. <span class="cmt_word">In his first born.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> is often used of the price paid for a thing, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a>. And in his youngest son. The commentators have remarked on the rhythmical parallelism here, and Keil and others have supposed the passage to be an extract from an old Hebrew songbook, such as that of Jasher (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>). But this parallelism is not only a characteristic of poetry, but of all solemn and impassioned utterances in the language. (See, for instance, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). Masius, Munsterus, and others interpret the passage that the eldest son died when the foundation was laid; all the rest, but the youngest, in the interim; the youngest when the gates were set up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
