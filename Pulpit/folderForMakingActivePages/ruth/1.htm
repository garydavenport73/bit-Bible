And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it came to pass.</span> Or, more literally, "And it came to pass." The "And" is somewhat remarkable, standing at the commencement of the Book. But as it is also found at the commencement of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Ezekiel, Esther, and Ezra, its use, though inartistic, must be amenable to some literary law. The Books specified, even including Ezekiel, are historical They are parcels of history, each narrating events that had their genesis in more or less significant antecedent occurrences. This historical genesis, so very different from an "absolute commencement" of things, is indicated, though probably in unreflective spontaneity, by the copulative "And." <span class="cmt_word">In the days when the judges ruled.</span> Or, more literally, "when the judges judged." In primitive times there was no function that was more important for society than that of judiciously settling disputes between man and man. Every such settlement, besides conferring a benefit on society, and in particular on the individuals at variance, would increase the moral influence and social elevation of the judge. By and by his moral and social superiority would, in favorable circumstances, grow into authority, specifically judicial on the one hand, and generically political, or semi-political, on the other. When military prowess and skill in strategy were added, a ruler, champion, or leader would be the result. Many such leaders rose up among the Hebrews ere yet society was compactly organized. They were vanously endowed; but most of them were only very partially equipped for the judicious administration of the affairs of the commonwealth. All, however, were called <span class="accented">judges</span>; and the discharge of their high duties was denominated <span class="accented">judging</span>, even when it was entirely inconspicuous as regards judicial ability or judicious determinations. The Hebrew word for <span class="accented">judge</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;</span> <span class="accented">shofet</span>; and it is an interesting evidence of the very close kinship of Hebrew and Phoenician, that in Carthage the chief magistrate, as we learn from Livy and other Roman writers, was called <span class="accented">sufes</span> (originally, as we see from the inflection, <span class="accented">sufet</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That there was a famine.</span> An admirable though free rendering. In the original the structure of the whole statement is exceedingly primitive and "agglutinative" - <span class="accented">And</span> (<span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented">was in the days of the judging of the judges</span>, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">there</span>) <span class="accented">was a famine</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In the land.</span> Namely, of Israel. The non-specification of the particular country referred to is evidence that the writer was living in it, as one at home. Josephus says that it was under the judgeship of Eli, the high priest, that the famine spoken of occurred ('Antiquities,' 5:9, 1). But here the historian speaks "without book," and without any particular plausibility. Several expositors, such as Bishop Patrick, have antedated, by a very long way, the calculation of Josephus They would assign the famine to the period when the Midianites and Amalekites came up, "as grasshoppers for multitude, to destroy the land," so that Israel was greatly impoverished (see <a href="../../par/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>.). But it is in vain to multiply guesses. The date of the famine is not given, and it is futile to make inquisition for it. <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man.</span> The interpolation of the individualizing word "<span class="accented">certain"</span> is quite uncalled for, and now quite archaic. The simplicity of the original is sufficient, "And a man. <span class="cmt_word">Of Bethlehem</span>-<span class="cmt_word">judah.</span> Or, as it might be still more literally represented, "of Bethlehem, Judah." Them is no such single name as Bethlehem-judah.  There is only the apposition, for discrimination's sake, of one geographical name to another, just as we may say, in English, <span class="accented">Boston</span>, <span class="accented">Lincolnshire</span>, or <span class="accented">Alexandria</span>, <span class="accented">Dumbartonshire</span>. The localization of the main name is thus effectually indicated. There is another Alexandria in Egypt; there is another Boston in the United States of America; and there was in Palestine another Bethlehem, namely, in the canton of Zebulun (see <a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). Bethlehem, Judah, lies about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. "Its appearance," says Dr. Porter, "is striking. It is situated on a narrow ridge, which projects eastward from the central mountain range, and breaks down in abrupt terraced slopes to deep valleys on the north, east, and south. The terraces, admirably kept, and covered with rows of olives, intermixed with the fig and the vine, sweep in graceful curves round the ridge, regular as stairs" ('Syria and Palestine,' D. 199). The valleys below are exceptionally fertile, and have been so from time immemorial. Hence indeed the name <span class="accented">Beth-lehem</span>, or <span class="accented">Bread-house</span>. Its modern name is <span class="accented">Beit-lahm</span>, or <span class="accented">Flesh-house</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Went to sojourn in the land of Moab.</span> We have no word in English that exactly, corresponds to the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> rendered <span class="accented">sojourn</span>. The cognate noun is uniformly translated, in King James's version, <span class="accented">stranger</span>, and means <span class="accented">foreigner</span>. The verb means <span class="accented">to dwell as a foreigner</span>, but its root-idea is yet undetermined. The Latin <span class="accented">peregrinari</span> admirably corresponds. The man of Bethlehem, Judah, went forth from his own country to "peregrinate" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) "in the land of Moab;" literally, "in the fields of Moab," that is, "in the pastoral parts of the territory of Moab." It was not a very great way off, this land of his "peregrination." Its blue mountains, rising up luridly beyond the silver thread of the Jordan and the gleaming expanse of the Dead Sea, are distinctly visible from the Mount of Olives and the heights about Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">He, and his wife, and his two sons.</span> The resumptive he is employed for the purpose of linking on to him, in his "peregrination, the other members of the little household. He emigrated "along with his wife and two sons." He had fought hard to keep the wolf of hunger from his door, but was like to be beaten. One after another the props of his hope that better days would soon dawn had been swept from under him, and he saw no alternative but to leave for a season the land of his fathers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the man was Elimelech.</span> That is, "God is King,"  not, as the older critics were accustomed to interpret it, "My God is King." The intermediate i is not the possessive pronoun, but the vowel of union. The name would be originally significant of strong religious Sentiments, perhaps mingled with strong political principles. The imposition of it on a son would be something like a manifesto of the father's creed. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his wife Naomi.</span> Or rather "No-o-mi." The precise import of the word is not absolutely ascertained; but it is probable that it is somewhat abbreviated in its terraination, and means "God is sweet," or, very literally, "Jab is sweetness." It had been originally imposed as a name by some grateful and happy mother, who, by gracious providences, or by other gracious revelations, had been led to think that "sweet are the ways, sweet are the dealings, and sweet is the character of God." The word does not mean <span class="accented">beautiful</span>, as some suppose; nor <span class="accented">gracious</span>, as others suppose; nor <span class="accented">my delight</span>, as others still suppose. It was not intended to describe the character of the person who was to bear the name. It was intended to signalize, in the spirit of a manifesto, a much-prized feature in the Divine character - that feature, namely, that is displayed when "he deals sweetly with men." Gesenius is doubtless right when he makes <span class="accented">sweetness</span> the fundamental idea of the whole group of affiliated words (see his 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in voc</span>.). The cognate Hebrew adjective is rendered <span class="accented">sweet</span> in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-8.htm">Proverbs 23:8</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a> and the margin of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). In the light of this interpretation, and of it alone, can the full significance of what Naomi said on her return to Bethlehem be apprehended: "Call me not Naomi, call me <span class="accented">Mara</span>: for <span class="accented">the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly</span> with me" (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his two sons.</span> In our idiom we should say, "and the names of his two sons." The two sons, however, were for the moment regarded as a unity among the other units of the household. <span class="cmt_word">Mahlon</span>, or rather "Machlon," <span class="cmt_word">and Chillon.</span> We need not dip deeply into the etymological import of these names, or attach to them, as applied to Elimelech's children, any peculiar significance. The names, unlike those of the parents, are devoid of theological tinge, and, in these modern times at all events, their import is liable to endless debate. One would at the first blush of consideration suppose that the one meant <span class="accented">sickliness</span>, and the other <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption -</span> rather uninteresting and melancholy ideas. But they are peculiarly confounding when we consider that the individuals, so named in our story, had apparently inherited a delicate constitution, which developed in both of them into premature <span class="accented">sickliness and decay</span>. The names have the aspect of being prophetic. And yet, even though we should assume that Elimelech, in virtue of some  element of bodily delicacy, was afflicted with feelings of morbid despondency, it is hard to come to the conclusion that he would deliberately stereotype his most hypochondriacal anticipations in the names of his children. The probability is, that the names, as names, would originally have some other import, Dr. Cassel supposes that they meant, respectively, <span class="accented">joy</span> and <span class="accented">ornament</span>; but he trusts to impossible etymologies. Raabe, taking his cue from Sanskrit roots, interprets the one thus "He who brings gifts with him;" and the other thus - "He who conceals his wife in his house." Warner, taking his cue from Chaldea cognates, interprets the former of the two names as meaning <span class="accented">ready to forgive</span>, and the latter as holding forth the idea of <span class="accented">hopeful</span>. All of them unlikely derivations. And yet something quite distinct from the ideas of <span class="accented">sickliness</span> and <span class="accented">consumption</span>, but lying so far on parallel lines of thought, may be conceived. The primary import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, the root of <span class="accented">Machlon</span>, is apparently <span class="accented">to be tender</span>. Thence the word came by one line of thought to mean <span class="accented">to be physically tender</span>, that is, <span class="accented">to be sick</span>; and by another that runs out in Chaldea it came to mean <span class="accented">to be morally teenier</span>, <span class="accented">to be mild or forgiving</span>. Machlon may mean <span class="accented">mildness</span> or <span class="accented">tender-heartedness</span>. Again, the primary idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the root of Chillon, is <span class="accented">to complete</span>. But, besides the completion that is realized in <span class="accented">consuming</span>, <span class="accented">consumption</span>, or <span class="accented">ending</span>, there is moral <span class="accented">completeness</span>, the <span class="accented">completeness</span> or <span class="accented">finish</span> that is realized in <span class="accented">perfection</span> (see <a href="../../par/psalms/119-96.htm">Psalm 119:96</a>: "I have seen an end of all <span class="accented">perfection"</span>). This idea of <span class="accented">beautiful completeness</span>, <span class="accented">or perfection</span>, is more likely to be the meaning of the name than the idea of <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Ephrathitas of Bethlehem Judah.</span> It is not simply the two sons who are so designated. It is the whole group. They were Ephrathites, that is, Bethlehemites, for the old name of Bethlehem was Ephrath, or Ephratha. As, however, the word Ephrathite also meant Ephraimite (see <a href="../../par/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; and <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>), it gave precision to the designation, although at the expense of a little redundancy, to say "Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah." <span class="cmt_word">And they came into the country of Moab.</span> The Hebrew emigrants reached the <span class="accented">fields</span> or <span class="accented">pastoral terrgtory</span> of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">And continued there.</span> The phrase in the original is of primitive simplicity - "and were there." It has been asked by theological critics whether Elimelech was justifiable in removing to an "<span class="accented">idolatrous</span> country" to avoid the inconveniences of a famine in the land of his nativity. It is enough to say in reply that there is no hint in the text itself that the step taken was blamable or blamed. "<span class="accented">No</span> man ought," says Lawson, "to be condemned, whether dead or alive, without proofs of guilt; and no certain proofs of guilt appear in the present case." "<span class="accented">The</span> beam of Elimelech's judgment," says Dr. Thomas Fuller, "is <span class="accented">justly</span> weighed down to <span class="accented">go</span> from Bethlehem, Judah, into the land of Moab." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-3.htm">Ruth 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - "In these words," says Fuller, "we have two marriages ushered and followed by funerals." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elimelech Naomi's husband died.</span> Apparently soon after the settlement of the family. No details, however, are given, as, on the one hand, no blame is attached to the conduct of Elimelech, and as, on the other, the line of biographical interest runs in another direction. <span class="cmt_word">And she was left, and her two sons.</span> Not only was the mother her husband's <span class="accented">relict</span>; they were all <span class="accented">left behind</span>. He had gone somewhither in advance, and they "remained." So the word is frequently rendered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-4.htm">Ruth 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab.</span> It was their own act. Josephus, reproducing the narrative from memory, represents the event as occurring in the father's lifetime, and as brought about by his arrangement. He says of Elimelech, "Coming into the territory of Moab, he sojourns there, and, things pros-paring according to his mind, he gives in marriage to his sons (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) Moabitish wives." Theological critics have here again raised the question, Was it sinful in these emigrant Hebrews to take in marriage daughters of the land? The Chaldee Targumist did not hesitate in his decision. He begins his paraphrase of the verse, thus - "And they transgressed the edict of the word of the Lord, and took to themselves alien wives of the daughters of Mesh." Dr. Thomas Fuller represents Naomi as passionately remonstrating with her sons. He says of himself, "<span class="accented">My</span> mouth denieth to be the orator of an unjust action." "Nothing can be brought," he adds, "for the defense of these matches. Something may be said for the excuse of them, but that fetched not from piety, but from policy." It is note worthy, however, that in the text itself, and throughout the entire Book, there is nothing of the nature of condemnation, not the least hint of blame. There was a law, indeed, which laid an interdict upon marriages with Canaanites (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). But these Canaanites occupied a peculiar relation to the Hebrews. They were within the line of that Canaan which had become the land of Israel. Israelites and Canaanites were thus living within the same borders as rival claimants of the same territory. It was no wonder that the Canaanites' claim was not  to be recognized by the Hebrews. The Moabites, however, living within the lines or "coasts" of their own distinct territory, stood in quite a different relation. And while, for purity's sake, great restrictions were to be laid upon all overtures for naturalization (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>), yet the law could never he intended to apply to the families of Hebrews who were settlers in Moab, or to Moabitish females living in their own land, and rather awarding than seeking the prerogatives' of natives. <span class="cmt_word">The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth.</span> No doubt native Moabitish names. Much ingenuity has been expended on that of the more interesting person. Some have unwarrantably assumed that <span class="accented">Ruth</span> is a contraction of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> meaning a <span class="accented">female companion</span> or <span class="accented">friend</span>. Still more unwarrantable, though more captivating to the aesthetic imagination, is the signification which is given to the word by Weruer and Eadie, namely, <span class="accented">beauty</span>. It is founded on an impossible derivation from the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Still more aesthetically captivating is the conjecture of Cassel, that the name is the ancient Semitic form of the Indo-European word <span class="accented">rodon</span> or <span class="accented">rose</span>. "At all events," says he, "the thought of Ruth <span class="accented">as the Rose of Moab</span> is in itself too attractive not to be proposed as a conjecture." It is certainly, most attractive and most admirable as a <span class="accented">jeu d'esprit</span>, but too imaginative to be vindicated on grounds of comparative philology. <span class="cmt_word">And they dwelt there.</span> Or, "settled themselves there; literally, "sat them." We still call a gentleman's mansion his seat. <span class="cmt_word">About ten years</span>, which, however, are treated by the writer as a mere blank in his story. He hastens on. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-5.htm">Ruth 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>, to make a long story short, <span class="cmt_word">Machlon and Chillon died also both of them.</span> "Like green apples," says Fuller, "cudgelled off the tree." But why "cudgelled?" There is no evidence in the text of Divine displeasure, and the Christian expositor, when going beyond the text in quest of principles, should not forget the tower of Siloam, and the victims of Pilate s bloodthirstiness (see <a href="../../par/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</span> That is, "of her two children as well as of her husband." She became as it were their <span class="accented">relict</span> too. She remained behind after they had gone on before. If all sentiment were to be taken out of the expression, it might then be simply said, in very commonplace prose, <span class="accented">she survived them</span>. Poor woman! "Of the two sexes," says Fuller, "the woman is the weaker; of women, old women are most feeble; of old women, widows most woeful; of widows, those that are poor, their plight most pitiful; of poor widows, those who want children, their case most doleful; of widows that want children, those that once had them, and after lost them, their estate most desolate; of widows that have had children, those that are strangers in a foreign country, their condition most comfortless. Yet all these met together in Naomi, as in the center of sorrow, to make the measure of her misery pressed down, shaken together, running over. I conclude, therefore, many men have had affliction - none like Job; many women have had tribulation - none like Naomi." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:6-14.

That she might return - an admirable rendering into English idiom. The phrase in the original is simply "and she returned," that is, "and she began to return." <span class="cmt_word">From the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.</span> Or, more literally, "<span class="accented">for</span> she heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah" - or, rather, "Yahveh," or, as Epiphanius gives it, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;</span> - "<span class="accented">had</span> visited his people to give them bread." There is no warrant, however, and no need, to add, with the Chaldee Targumist, that the news was conveyed <span class="accented">by the mouth of an angel</span>. And the representation is not that Yahveh, in giving, bread to his people, had thereby visited them; it is that he hid visited them" to give them bread. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, rendered <span class="accented">visited</span>, is quite peculiar, with no analogue in English, German, Greek, or Latin. Yahveh had <span class="accented">directed his attention</span> to his people, and had, so to speak, <span class="accented">made inquisition into their state</span>, and had hence taken steps to give them bread (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). They had already got it, or, as the Septuagint translates, they had got <span class="accented">loaves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">meats</span> (eseas). It is assumed in the tidings that the seasons and their products, and all beneficent influences in nature, belong to Yahveh. It is likewise assumed that the Hebrews were his people, albeit not in such a sense as to secure for them more "bread" and "milk and honey" than other peoples  enjoyed.

The jealousies that so often disturb the peace of households had no place within the bounds of Naomi's jurisdiction. The home of which she was the matronly center had been kept in its own beautiful orbit by the law of mutual respect, deference, affection, and esteem - the law that insures happiness to both the loving and the loved. "If there were more Naomis," says Lawson, "there might be more Orpahs and Ruths." <span class="cmt_word">And they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</span> Having left her Moabitish abode, and got into the frequented track which led in the direction of her native land, she journeyed onward for a stage or two, accompanied by her daughters-in-law. Such is the picture. It must be subsumed in it that her daughters-in-law had made up their minds to go with her to the land of her nativity. The subject had been often talked over and discussed. Naomi would from time to time start objections to their kind intention. They, on their part, would try to remove her difficulties, and would insist on accompanying her. So the three widows journeyed onward together, <span class="accented">walking</span>. Adversity had pressed hard on their attenuated resources, and they would not be encumbered with burdensome baggage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-8.htm">Ruth 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house.</span> She reverted, with deeper earnestness, to their theme, of discussion. She acknowledged that most kindly had they acted toward her. Her heart was filled with gratitude. It was likewise agitated with grief at the prospect of bidding them a final farewell, Nevertheless, she felt that it would be unreasonable and unkind to invite them to be, to any further degree, sharers of her adversity. Hence, thanking them for their loving convoy, she would remind them that every step further on would only increase the length of their return-journey; and she said, Go, return each to her mother's home. There, in the females' apartment, and in the bosom of their mothers, they would surely find a welcome and a refuge. She judges of their mothers by herself, and she refers rather to them than to their fathers, partly, perhaps, because she bears in mind her own motherhood, but principally, no doubt, because, in those Oriental countries, it lay very particularly within the province of mothers to make arrangements in reference to their daughters. <span class="cmt_word">May Yahveh deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the deceased, and with me.</span> It is beautiful gratitude, and at the same time a touching monument to the faithfulness and gentleness that had characterized and adorned the young widows. Her simple Hebrew theology, moreover, comes finely out. She assumes that her own Yahveh reigned in Moab as in Judah, and that all blessing descended from him. There is a little peculiarity in the Hebrew pronouns in this clause. They are masculine instead of feminine. The influence of the stronger sex overrides grammatically, for the moment, the influence of the weaker. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each <i>of you</i> in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">May Yahveh grant to you that ye may find rest, each in the house of her husband.</span> Naomi again, when the current of her tenderest feelings was running full and strong, lifts up her longing heart toward her own Yahveh. He was the God not of the Hebrews only, but of the Gentiles likewise, and rifled and overruled in Moab. The prayer is, in its form, full of syntactical peculiarity: "May Yahveh give to you," and, as the result of his giving, "may you find rest, each [in] the house of her husband." The expression, "the house of her husband," is used locatively. It is an answer to the suppressed question, "Where are they to find rest?" And hence, in our English idiom, we must insert the preposition, "in the house of her husband." As to the substance of the prayer, it has, as truly as the grammatical syntax, its own tinge of Orientalism. Young females in Moab had but little scope for a life of usefulness and happiness, unless shielded round and round within the home of a pure and devoted husband. Naomi was well aware of this, and hence, in her motherly solicitude for her virtuous daughters-in-law, she gave them to understand that it would be the opposite of a grief to her if they should seek, in the one way open to them in that comparatively undeveloped state of society, to brighten the homes of the lonely. In such homes, it circumstances were propitious, they would find deliverance from unrest and anxiety. They would find <span class="accented">rest</span>. It would be a position in which they could <span class="accented">abide</span>, and in which their tenderest feelings and most honorable desires would find satisfaction and <span class="accented">repose</span>. The peculiar force of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is finely displayed by the texture of the associated expressions in <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17, 18</a>: "<span class="accented">And</span> the work of righteousness shall be <span class="accented">peace</span>; and the effect of righteousness <span class="accented">quietness</span> and <span class="accented">assurance forever</span>; and my people shall dwell in <span class="accented">a peaceable habitation</span>, and in <span class="accented">sure dwellings</span>, and in <span class="accented">quiet resting-places"</span>  (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And she kissed them,</span> locking them lingeringly and lovingly in a farewell embrace. "<span class="accented">Kissed</span> them." The preposition <span class="accented">to</span>, according to the customary Hebrew idiom, <span class="accented">stands</span> before the pronoun. In kissing, Naomi imparted herself passionately <span class="accented">to</span> her beloved daughters-in-law, and clung <span class="accented">to</span> them. There would be full-hearted reciprocation, and each to each would cling "in their embracement, as they grew together" (Shakespeare, <span class="accented">Henry VIII</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And they lifted up their voice and wept.</span> The idea is not that all three wept aloud. The pronoun "they" refers to the daughters-in-law, as is evident both from the preceding and from the succeeding context. The fine idiomatic version of the Vulgate brings out successfully and unambiguously the true state of the <span class="accented">case - quae elevata voce flere coeperunt</span>. The <span class="accented">lifting</span>, <span class="accented">up of the voice</span> in weeping must be thought of according to the measure of Oriental, as distinguished from Occidental, custom. In the East there is less self-restraint in this matter than in the West.

The expression in the original is broken at the commencement: "And they said to her, For with thee we shall return to thy people." It is as if they had said, "Do not insist on our return to our mothers' homes, <span class="accented">for with thee we shall return to thy people</span>." Note the expression, "we shall return, instead of "<span class="accented">we</span> shall go with thee in thy return to thy people."

To what purpose should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that might be husbands to you?</span> According to the old Levirate law - a survival of rude and barbarous times - Orpah and Ruth, having had husbands who died without issue, would have been entitled to claim marriage with their husbands' brothers, if such surviving brothers there had been (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24-28</a>). And if the surviving brothers were too young to be married, the widows, if they chose, might wait on till they reached maturity (see <a href="../../par/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>.). It is in the light of these customs that we are to read Naomi's remonstrance's. The phraseology in the second interrogation is very primitive, and primitively ' agglutinative.' "Are there yet to be sons in my womb, and they shall be to you for husbands?" (see on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">Turn again, my daughters, go <i>your way</i>; for I am too old to have an husband.

"Go, for I am too old to have a husband." A euphemistic rendering; but the original is euphemistic too, though under another phraseological phase. "But even if I could say, I have hope." The poverty of the Hebrew verb, in respect of provision to express "moods, ' is conspicuous: "<span class="accented">that</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">suppose</span> that I said, I have hope." Mark the climactic representation. <span class="accented">Firstly</span>, Naomi makes, for argument's sake, the supposition that she might yet have sons; then, <span class="accented">secondly</span>, she carries her supposition much higher, namely, that she might that very night have a husband; and then, <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, she carries the supposition a great deal higher still, namely, that even already her sons were brought forth: "Would you therefore wait?" Note the <span class="accented">therefore</span>. Ibn Ezra, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version assume that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">for them</span>. The feminine pronoun, however, as applied to Naomi's sons, is, on that supposition, all but inexplicable. It is much better to assume, with the majority of modern critics, that it is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, whether we call it a Chaldaism or not. Certainly it was current in Chaldee (see <a href="../../par/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6, 9</a>). But it may have floated in circles of Semitic society that were never included within Chaldaea proper. Indeed, there were no precise limits bounding off the Chaldee language from the kindred dialects, just as there are no such limits in English or in German, or in any member of a linguistic group. Idioms often overlap. In the two interrogative clauses, "Would ye for that purpose wait till they grew up. Would ye for that purpose seclude, yourselves, so as not to have husbands? there is a parallelism; only, in the second clause, the representation rises. "For my lot is exceedingly bitter, more than even yours;" literally, "for it is bitter to me exceedingly, beyond you." The verb is used impersonally. Naomi means that her case was even more lamentable than theirs, so that she could not encourage them to hang their dependence on her help, or to hope for a retrieval of their circumstances in becoming partakers of her fortunes. The translation of King James's version, "for your sakes," though decidedly supported by the Septuagint, is unnatural. Pagnin and Drusius both give the correct rendering, "more than you." So do Michaelis and Wright, But Bertheau and Gesenius agree with King James s  version. The Syriac Peshito, strange to say, gives both translations, "I feel very bitterly for you, and to me it is more bitter than to you."

Hence the propriety of the singular number, as in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And wept again.</span> The "again" doubles back on the statement in ver. 9. With uplifted voice, in shrill Oriental wail, and amid streams of tears, they bemoaned their hapless lot. Then, after the paroxysm of grief had somewhat spent itself, Orpah yielded to her mother-in-law's dissuasives, and at length imprinted on her, reluctantly and passionately, a farewell kiss. Then, not waiting to ascertain the ultimate decision of Ruth, or rather, perhaps, having now a fixed presentiment what it would be, she moved regretfully and tearfully away. She was afraid, perhaps, that if she, as well as Ruth, should insist on accompanying her mother-in-law, the two might be unreasonably burdensome to the aged widow. Perhaps, too, she was not without fear that her own burden in a foreign land, amid strangers, might be too heavy to be borne. There is not, however, the slightest need for supposing that she was, in any respect, deficient in attachment to her mother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">Ruth clave to her mother-in-law</span>, all reasonings, remonstrances, dissuasives on Naomi's part notwithstanding. Ruth would not be parted from her. "Clave." It is the same word that is used in the primitive law of marriage. "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall <span class="accented">cleave</span> to his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). It occurs again in <a href="../../par/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>: "My soul <span class="accented">followeth hard</span> after thee; and in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-31.htm">Psalm 119:31</a>: "<span class="accented">I</span> have <span class="accented">stuck</span> to thy testimonies." Joshua said, "Cleave unto the Lord thy God" (<a href="../../par/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a>); and many have had sweet, while others have had bitter, experience of the truth that "there is a friend that <span class="accented">sticketh closer</span> than a brother" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:15-22.

The same interpretation, it is noteworthy, is given in the Targum of Jonathan, who renders the expression,  "and to her Fear" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>). Such a translation assumes that the Moabites were not only theists, but monotheists. And yet  in the mythology, or primitive theology, of Moab, we read both of Baal-Peor and of Chemosh. As to the former, see <a href="../../par/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>. As to the latter, see <a href="../../par/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7, 13</a>. In Numbers, moreover, 21:29, and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>, the Moabites are called the <span class="accented">people of Chemosh</span>, and frequently is their national god called Chemosh in the inscription of King Mesha on <span class="accented">the Moabitish Stone</span>, so recently discovered and deciphered. It is supposed, not without reason, that the two names belonged to one deity, Chemosh being the old native name. Nevertheless, the translation "to her god" is an interpretation, not a literal rendering, and, on the other hand, the translation "to her gods" would, on the hypothesis of the monotheism of the Moabites, be unidiomatic. The original expression, "to her Elohim," does not tell anything, and was not intended by Naomi to tell anything, or to hint anything, of a numerical character concerning the object or objects of the Moabitish worship. <span class="accented">It was an expression equally appropriate whether there was</span>, <span class="accented">or was not</span>, <span class="accented">a plurality of objects worshipped</span>. It might be liberally rendered, <span class="accented">and to her own forms of religious worship</span>. The word <span class="accented">elohim</span> was a survival of ancient polytheistic theology and worship, when a plurality of powers were held in awe. "<span class="accented">For</span>," says Fuller, "the heathen, supposing that the whole world, with all the creatures therein, was too great a diocese to be daily visited by one and the same deity, they therefore assigned sundry gods to several creatures." The time arrived, however, when the great idea flashed into the Hebrew mind, <span class="accented">The Powers are One</span> and hence the plural noun, with its subtended conception of unity, became construed with verbs and adjectives in the singular number. It was so construed when applied to the one living God; but it readily retained its original applicability to a plurality of deifies, and hence, in such a passage as the one before us, where there is neither adjective nor verb to indicate the number, the word is quite incapable of exact rendering into English. <span class="cmt_word">Orpah had returned to her people and her Elohim.</span> Return thou after thy sister-in-law. Are we then to suppose that Naomi desired Ruth to return to her Moabitish faith? Is it with a slight degree of criticism that she referred to Orpah's palinode? Would she desire that Ruth should, in this matter, follow in her sister-in-law's wake? We touch on tender topics. Not unlikely she had all along suspected or seen that Orpah would not have insuperable religious scruples. And not unlikely, too, she would herself be free from narrow religious bigotry, at least to the extent of dimly admitting that the true worship of the heart could reach the true God, even when offensive names, and forms, and symbolisms were present in the outer courts of the creed. Nevertheless, when she said to Ruth, "Return thou after thy sister-in-law," she no doubt was rather putting her daughter-in-law to a final test, and leading her to thorough self-sifting, than encouraging her to go back to her ancestral forms of worship. "God," says Fuller, "<span class="accented">wrestled</span> with Jacob with desire to be conquered; so Naomi no doubt opposed Ruth, hoping and wishing that she herself might be foiled." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, <i>or</i> to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people <i>shall be</i> my people, and thy God my God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ruth said, Insist not on me forsaking thee: for whither thou goest, I will go.</span> Ruth's mind was made up. Her heart would not be wrenched away from her mother-in-law. The length of the journey, its dangers, and the inevitable fatigue accompanying it, moved not, by so much as a jot, her resolution. Had not her mother-in-law the same distance to travel, the same fatigue to endure, the same perils to encounter? Might not the aged traveler, moreover, derive some assistance and cheer from the company of a young, ready-handed, and willing-hearted companion? She was resolved. Nothing on earth would separate them. <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge</span>. A better version than Luther's, "Where thou stayest, I will stay" (<span class="accented">wo du bleibest</span>, <span class="accented">da bleibe ich auch</span>). The reference is not to the ultimate destination, but to the nightly halts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> is the verb employed; and it is rendered "to tarry all night" in <a href="../../par/genesis/24-54.htm">Genesis 24:54</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-6.htm">Judges 19:6</a>, etc. It is the Latin <span class="accented">pernoetare</span> and the German <span class="accented">ubernachten</span>, the former being the rendering of the Vulgate, and the latter the translation in the <span class="accented">Berlenburger Bibel</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy people (is) my people, and thy God my God.</span> There being no verb in the original, it is well to supply the simplest copula.

Nor did she wish her remains to be conveyed back for burial to the land of her nativity. <span class="cmt_word">So may Yahveh do to me, and still more, but death only shall part me and thee.</span> She appeals to the God of the Israelites, the one universal God. She puts herself on oath, and invokes his severest penal displeasure if she should suffer anything less uncontrollable than death to part her from her mother-in-law. "So may Yahveh do to me." It was thus that the Hebrews made their most awful appeals to Yahveh. They signified their willingness to suffer some dire calamity if they should either do the  evil deed repudiated or fail to do the good deed promised. So stands in misty indefiniteness; not, as Fuller supposes, by way of "leaving it to the discretion of God Almighty to choose that arrow out of his quiver which he shall think it most fit to shoot," but as a kind of euphemism, or cloudy veil, two-thirds concealing, and one-third revealing, whatever horrid infliction could by dramatic sign be represented or hinted. <span class="accented">And still more - a</span> thoroughly Semitic idiom, <span class="accented">and so may he add</span> (<span class="accented">to do</span>)  There was first of all a full imprecation, and then an additional 'bittock,' to lend intensity to the asseveration. "<span class="accented">But</span> death only shall sever between me and thee!" Ruth's language is broken. Two formulas of imprecation are flung together. One, if complete, would have been to this effect: "So may Yahveh do to me, and so may he add to do, if (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) aught but death sever between me and thee!" The other, if complete, would have run thus: "<span class="accented">I</span> swear by Yahveh 'that' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) death, death only, shall part thee and me. In the original the word <span class="accented">death</span> has the article, <span class="accented">death emphatically</span>. It is as if she had said <span class="accented">death</span>, <span class="accented">the great divider</span>. The full idea is in substance <span class="accented">death alone</span>. This divider alone, says Ruth, "<span class="accented">shall</span> sever between me and thee;" literally, "<span class="accented">between</span> me and between thee," a Hebrew idiom, repeating for emphasis' sake the two-sided relationship, but taking the repetition in reverse order, <span class="accented">between me</span> (<span class="accented">and thee</span>) and <span class="accented">between thee</span> (<span class="accented">and me</span>).

Interest, sympathy, gossip would be alive throughout the little town, especially among the female portion of the population, and loud would be their exclamations of surprise. The verb <span class="accented">they said is</span> feminine in Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> a nicety which cannot be reproduced in English without obtruding too prominently the sex referred to, as m Michaelis's version - "and all the women said." So the Vulgate. The verb which we have rendered <span class="accented">got into commotion</span> is found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a> - "the earth <span class="accented">rail again</span>;" and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-45.htm">1 Kings 1:45</a> <span class="accented">-</span> "the city <span class="accented">rang again</span>." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</span> Salutations were respectfully addressed to her as she walked along in quest of some humble abode. And when thus spoken to by the sympathetic townspeople, she was called, of course, by her old <span class="accented">sweet</span> name. But as it fell in its own rich music on her ears, its original import flashed vividly upon her mind. Her heart "filled" at the contrast which her circumstances represented, and she said, "Address me not as Naomi, call not to me (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Naomi: address me as Mara," - that is, <span class="accented">bitter</span>, <span class="accented">-</span> "for the Almighty has caused bitterness to me exceedingly" (see on ver. 2). <span class="accented">The Almighty</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, an ancient polytheistic name that had at length - like <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;</span> ? been reclaimed in all its fullness for the one living and true God. It had become a thorough proper name, and hence it is used without the article. In the Septuagint it is sometimes rendered, as here, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the Sufficient</span>; in Job, where it frequently occurs, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">the Omnipotent</span>. But it is one of those peculiar nouns that never can be fully reproduced in any Aryan language, Naomi's theology as indicated in the expression, "the Almighty hath caused bitterness to me exceedingly," need not be to its minutest jot endorsed. God was not the only agent with whom she had had to do. Much of the bitterness of her lot may have been attributable to her husband or to herself, and perhaps to forefathers and foremothers. It is not fair to ascribe all the embittering element of things to God. Much rather might the sweetness, which had so often relieved the bitterness, be traced to the band of him who is "the Lord God, merciful and gracious, abundant in goodness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ruth/1-21.htm">Ruth 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why <i>then</i> call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I went forth full, and Yahveh has caused me to return in emptiness. Why should you call me Naomi, and Yahveh has  testified against me, and the Almighty has brought evil upon me?</span> She went forth "full," with husband and sons, not to speak of goods. She was under the necessity of returning <span class="accented">in emptiness</span>, or <span class="accented">with empty</span> hands. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> does not exactly mean <span class="accented">empty</span>, as it is rendered in the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version. It is not an adjective, but an adverb, <span class="accented">emptily</span>. This lamentable change of circumstances she attributed to the action of Yahveh. He had, she believed, been testifying against her by means of the trials through which she had passed. She was right in a certain conditional acceptation of her language; but only on <span class="accented">condition of that condition</span>. And, let us condition her declarations as we may, she was probably in danger of making the same mistake concerning herself and her trials which was made by Job's comforters in reference to the calamities by which he was overwhelmed. In so far as <span class="accented">penal evil is</span> concerned, it may be traced directly or circuitously to the will and government of God. "<span class="accented">Shall</span> there be <span class="accented">evil -</span> that is, penal evil - in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" (<a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). But <span class="accented">there are many sufferings that are not penal</span>. The evil that is penal is only one segment of physical evil; and then there is besides, metaphysical evil, or the evil that consists in the inevitable imperfection of finite being. It is noteworthy that the participle of the Hiphilic verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> employed by Naomi is always translated in King James s version <span class="accented">evil doer</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked doer</span>, or <span class="accented">evil</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked</span>, Naomi, in using such a term, and applying it to Yahveh, was walking on a theological precipice, where it is not needful that we should accompany her. Instead of the literal expression, '<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, we may, with our English wealth of conjunctions freely say, '<span class="accented">when</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>. There is a charm in the original simplicity. There is likewise a charm in the more complex structure of the free translation.
