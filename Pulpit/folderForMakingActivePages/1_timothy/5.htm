The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> in the comment on the fourth commandment in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4-6</a>, where the withholding of the honor due consists in saying, "It is corban, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me," and so withholding the honor due, shows clearly that in the notion of <span class="accented">honoring is</span> included that material support which their condition as widows required. So again in ver. 17 of this chapter, the "<span class="accented">double</span> honor" due to elders who labor in the Word and doctrine is clearly shown by ver. 18 to include payment for their maintenance. This is also borne out by the frequent use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> in the sense of  "price" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, etc.). The passage might, therefore, be paraphrased, "Pay due regard to the wants of those widows who are widows indeed." The "honor" here prescribed would be exactly the opposite to the "neglect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) complained of by the Grecian Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a>). The same idea is in the Latin <span class="accented">honorarium</span>, for a <span class="accented">fee</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Widows indeed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> really, as in vers. 5 and 16, desolate and alone. We learn from this passage that the care of widows by the whole Church, which began at Jerusalem in the very infancy of the Church, was continued in the Churches planted by St. Paul. We find the same institution though somewhat different in character, in subsequent ages of the Church. Widowhood, as well as virginity, became a religious profession, and widows were admitted with certain ceremonies, including the placing on their heads a veil consecrated by the bishop. Deaconesses were very frequently chosen from the ranks of the widows (Bingham, 'Antiq.,' bk. 7. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.).

Locke's phrase, "a nephew by a brother," seems to show the transition to the modern use of "nephew."

The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> had nourished and cared for them in their childhood; they must requite that care by honoring and supporting them in their old age. <span class="cmt_word">This is acceptable</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or LXX., and rarely if ever in classical Greek. The same idea is expressed in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19, 20</a>, by <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, "This is acceptable with God."

A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, rendered "now" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it "but." The apostle is contrasting the condition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second "but" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who "giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Hath her hope set on God</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Supplications and prayers</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Night and day.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">by night and by day</span> would express the genitive better (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-14.htm">Matthew 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>), as indicating time <span class="accented">when</span>, rather than time <span class="accented">how long</span>.

As regards the order of the words, "day and night," or "night and day," there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has "night and day" (<a href="../../par/mark/4-7.htm">Mark 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>); St. Luke uses both (<a href="../../par/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>).

We do not know enough of the Church institutions of the apostolic age to enable us to say positively what their status or their functions were, but doubtless they were the germ from which the later development (of which see Bingham, bk. 7. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.) took its rise. We may gather, however, from the passage before us that their lives were specially consecrated to the service of God and the Church; that they were expected to be instant and con-slant in prayer, and to devote themselves to works of charity; that the apostle did not approve of their marrying again after their having embraced this life of widowhood, and therefore would have none enrolled under sixty years of age; and generally that, once on the roll, they would continue there for their life. <span class="cmt_word">Enrolled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>); only here in the New Testament or (in this sense) in the LXX.; but it is the regular classical word for enrolling, enlisting, soldiers, etc. Hence our word "catalogue." In like manner, in the times of the Empress Helena, the virgins of the Church are described as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (Socr., 1:17), "registered in the Church's register," or list of virgins. <span class="cmt_word">Under three score years old.</span> A similar rule was laid down in several early canons, which forbade the veiling of virgins before the age of <span class="accented">forty</span>. This care to prevent women from being entangled by vows or engagements which they had not well considered, or of which they did not know the full force, is in striking contrast with the system which allows young girls to make irrevocable vows. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, "being," belongs to this clause (not as in the A.V. to the following one), as Alford clearly shows, and as the R.V. also indicates, by putting <span class="accented">having been</span> in italics; though it does not translate <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in this clause, unless possibly the word "old" is considered as representing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. It should <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as widows</span>, <span class="accented">being under sixty years of age</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The wife of one man</span>; see above, <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, the similar phrase, "the husband of one wife" (which likewise stands without any participle), and the note there. To which may be added that it is hardly conceivable that St. Paul should within the compass of a few verses (see ver. 14) recommend the marriage of young widows, and yet make the fact of a second marriage an absolute bar to a woman being enrolled among the Church widows.

The only apparent exception in Holy Scripture is <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where the nurse's <span class="accented">alumni</span> are called "her own children," but obviously this is no rent exception.

The sense, therefore, is that these young widows, in the wantonness and unsubdued worldliness of their hearts, reject the yoke of Christ, and kick against the widow's life of prayer and supplication day and night.

Do not give the adversary a starting-point from which he may be able to carry out his desire to revile the people of God.

This is generally understood of some widows who had already given occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, by turning aside from the path of Christian virtue which they had begun to walk in, and following Satan who had beguiled them into the path of vice and folly. But the words are capable of another meaning, equally arising kern the preceding verse, viz. that some have already followed the example of Satan, "the accuser of the brethren," and have begun to revile Christianity, taking occasion from the conduct of some who were called Christians. These revilers might be not unbelieving Jews or heathen, but apostate or heretical Jews like those of whom the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is used in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>.

And so we say, "twice as good," "twice as much," with the same indefinite meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The Word and teaching.</span> The "Word" means generally "the Word of God," as we have "preach the Word," "hear the Word," "the ministry of the Word," "doers of the Word," etc. And although there is no article before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> here yet, considering the presence of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, and St. Paul's less careful use of the article in his later Epistles, this absence is not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of those considerations which lead to the conclusion that "laboring in the Word" refers to the Word of God.

But in <a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> the words are identical with those here used, even to the omission (in the R.T.) of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The conclusion is inevitable that the writer of this Epistle was acquainted with and quoted from St. Luke's Gospel; and further, that he deemed it, or at least the saying of the Lord Jesus recorded, in it, to be of equal authority with "<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>," the Scripture. If this Epistle was written by St. Paul after his first imprisonment at Rome, we may feel tolerably certain that he was acquainted with the Gospel or St. Luke, so that there is no improbability in his quoting from it. His reference to another saying of the Lord Jesus in <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a> gives additional probability to it. The passage in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> seems also to be a direct reference to the Lord's Prayer, as contained in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Paul does not directly call the words <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, only treats them as of equal authority, which, if they were the words of Christ, of course they were.

He was not to encourage <span class="accented">delatores</span>, secret accusers and defamers, but if any one had a charge to make against a ruler, it was to be done <span class="accented">in the presence</span> of witnesses (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with a genitive). A doubt arises whether" the witnesses" here spoken of were to be witnesses able to support the accusation, or merely witnesses in whose presence the accusation must be made. The juxtaposition of the legal terms <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> favors the strict meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, witnesses able to support the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. And, therefore, the direction to Timothy is, "Suffer no man to accuse a presbyter unless he is accompanied by two or three witnesses who are ready to back up the accusation." The italic <span class="accented">the mouth of</span>, in the R.V., is not necessary or indeed justified.

Here the witnesses are named: God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels. In <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a> it is "the Lord;" in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> God and Jesus Christ, as also in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>.

But as there is repeated mention in Holy Scripture of the fallen angels (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the obvious interpretation is that St. Paul, in this solemn adjuration, added the epithet to indicate more distinctly the "<span class="accented">holy</span> <span class="accented">angels</span>," as they are frequently described (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>, etc.), or "the angels of God" or "<span class="accented">of</span> heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>). Possibly the mention of Satan in ver. 15, or some of the rising Gnostic opinions about angels (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), may have suggested the epithet. The reason for the unusual addition of "the angels" is more difficult to adduce with certainty. But perhaps <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> gives us the clue, where the apostle shows that in appealing to Jesus Christ he has a special eye to the great and final judgment. Now, in the descriptions of the lust judgment, the angels are constantly spoken of as accompanying our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8.htm">Mark 8</a>:48; <a href="../../par/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, etc.). If St. Paul, therefore, had in his mind the great judgment-day when he thus invoked the names of God and of Christ, he would very naturally also make mention of the elect angels. And so Bishop Bull, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' <span class="cmt_word">Without prejudice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. or classical Greek, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in both. Although the English word "prejudice" seems at first sight an apt rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, it does not really give the sense so accurately as "preference." We commonly mean by "prejudice" a judgment formed prior to examination, which prevents our judging rightly or fairly when we come to the examination, which, however, is not the meaning of the Latin <span class="accented">praejudicium</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> means rather "to prefer" a person, or thing, to others. And therefore <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> means "preference," or "partiality," or, as the A.V. has it, "preferring one before another." The two meanings may be thus expressed. "Prejudice," in the English use of the word, is when a person who has to judge a cause upon evidence prejudges it without evidence, and so does not give its proper weight to the evidence. "Prefer-once" is when he gives different measure to different persons, according as He is swayed by partiality, or interest, or favor. St. Paul charges Timothy to measure out exactly equal justice to all persons alike. <span class="cmt_word">By partiality</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This also is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as far as the New Testament is concerned, and is not found in the LXX., but is found, as well as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, in classical Greek. It means literally the "inclination" of the scales to one side or the other, and hence a "bias" of the mind to one party or the other. The balance of justice in the hands of Timothy was to be equal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">Hastily</span> for <span class="accented">suddenly</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Lay hands</span>, etc. Surely if we are guided by St. Paul's own use of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, in the only two places in his writings where it occurs (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>), we must abide by the ancient interpretation of these words, that they mean the laying on of hands in ordination. So also in <a href="../../par/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a> and Acts 13:3, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is "to ordain." And the context here requires the same sense. The solemn injunction in the <span class="accented">pre</span>ceding verse, to deal impartially in judging even the most influential eider, naturally suggests the caution not to be hasty in ordaining any one to be an elder. Great care and previous inquiry were necessary before admitting any man, whatever might be his pretensions or position, to a holy office. A bishop who, on the spur of the moment, with improper haste, should ordain cue who afterwards required reproof as <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, sinning (ver. 20), would have a partnership in the man's sin, and in the evil consequences that flowed from it. And then it follows, <span class="cmt_word">Keep thyself pure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> clear and guiltless (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>), which he would not be if he was involved in the sin of the guilty elder. Observe that the stress is upon "thyself."

It is found in some codices of the LXX. in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12</a>, and also in classical Greek. We learn from hence the interesting fact that Timothy was, in modern parlance, a total abstainer; and we also learn that, in St. Paul's judgment, total abstinence was not to be adhered to if injurious to the health. The epithet, "a little," should not be overlooked. Was Luke, the beloved physician, with St. Paul when he wrote this prescription (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>)? It is also interesting to have this passing allusion to Timothy's bad health, and this instance of St. Paul's thoughtful consideration for him. <span class="cmt_word">Infirmities</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); in the sense of <span class="accented">sicknesses</span>, attacks of illness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a></div><div class="verse">Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <i>men</i> they follow after.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Evident</span> for <span class="accented">open beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">men also</span> for <span class="accented">men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Some men's sins</span>, etc. St. Paul is evidently here recurring to the topic which he had been dealing with ever since ver. 17, viz. Timothy's duty as a bishop, to whom was entrusted the selection of persons for the office of elder, or presbyter, and also the maintaining of discipline among his clergy. Alford sees the connection of the precept about drinking a little wine with what went before, and with this twenty-fourth verse, in the supposed circumstance that Timothy's weak health had somewhat weakened the vigor of his rule; and that the recommendation to leave off water-drinking was given more with a view to the firmer discharge of those duties than merely for his bodily comfort. This may be so. But there is nothing unlike St. Paul's manner in the supposition that he had done with the subject in hand at the end of the twenty-second verse, and passed on to the friendly hint with regard to Timothy's health, but then subjoined the fresh remarks in vers. 24 and 25, which were an afterthought. <span class="cmt_word">Evident</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a> besides these two verses, and in the apocryphal books of the Old Testament. It is common, with the kindred forms, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in classical Greek. It is doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb has the force of "beforehand," as in the A.V., and not rather that of "before the eyes of all," and therefore only intensifies the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>. But the natural force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in composition certainly is "before" in point of time; and hence in a compound like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would mean" evident before it is examined," which of course is equivalent to "very evident." St. Paul's meaning, therefore, would be: Some men's sins are notorious, requiring no careful inquisition in order to find them out; nay, they of themselves go before - before the sinner himself - unto judgment. But there are also some whose sins follow after them. It is not till after close inquiry that they are found out. They go up to the judgment-seat apparently innocent, but after a while their sins come trooping up to their condemnation. This enforces the caution, "Lay hands hastily on no man."
