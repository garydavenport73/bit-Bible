Something of this kind seems to have occurred in the wilderness, when God's law was first given to his people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12</a>); and therefore, when renewals of the covenant were made, and the people were required to ratify the act, it was natural to recur to the old sanction, An oath was probably taken of the people in the time of Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>), when they are said to have "stood to the covenant." <span class="cmt_word">Moses the servant of God</span>.

This precept of the law had been frequently neglected during the times of the monarchy, and its neglect was one of the sins which the captivity was expressly intended to punish (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). It now appears that after the return the precept had been again disobeyed. <span class="cmt_word">The exaction of every debt.</span> Literally, "the pledge of every hand." Compare <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-2.htm">Nehemiah 5:2-13</a>, and note that, notwithstanding Nehemiah's curse and the people's assent to it (ver. 13), the practice of lending upon pledge had recommenced.

Hitherto the Jews had had no impost analogous to our "church-rate." The "half-shekel of the sanctuary," as it is called, being only payable on the rare, and forbidden, occasion of a census of the whole people (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-16</a>), could not possibly have served for the ordinary support of the temple service; but it was calculated to suggest to thoughtful minds the need of some regular fund, and the persons on whom the obligation lay to provide it. While the Jews were an independent nation, with their own kings and their own revenue, no difficulty had been felt in keeping up the service, since the kings easily provided for it; but in the existing condition of affairs the case was different. A "governor" was not like a king; he was responsible; he was removable; he was bound to remit the great bulk of the taxes to the court. Under these circumstances, and probably in connection with an immediate need, the idea arose of a special (voluntary) tax, to be paid annually by all adult males, for the support of the service, the continual provision of the morning and evening sacrifice, the incense, the shew-bread, the red heifers, the scape-goat, the numerous victims, and the numerous meat and drink offerings required on various occasions, and especially at each of the great festivals. It was felt that the provision in the law ruled two things - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The uniformity of the tax; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The sphere of its incidence - that it should be paid by <span class="accented">all</span> adult males. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With regard to its proper amount, <span class="accented">that</span> had to be fixed by a consideration of existing needs in comparison with existing means. The third part of a shekel was determined on, as sufficient at the time; but it was not long ere for the third part the half-shekel was substituted, a return being thus made to the standard fixed by the law, and an ample provision made for the maintenance of the established rites in full completeness and efficiency (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>).

The "wood offering" is now first heard cf. Fuel had probably been more plentiful in the times of the monarchy than it had now become, and the temple treasury had been rich enough to provide what was needed in order to keep the altar fire perpetually burning (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>). But times had changed. The hill-country of Judaea had gradually been stripped of its forests. The temple was, comparatively speaking, poor, and some permanent arrangement for the supply of the required fuel had become necessary. It would seem, from the present passage, that the arrangement actually made was one by which different families or districts undertook the duty of furnishing the wood in turn, and lots were cast to determine the order in which they should discharge the office. According to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 17, &sect; 6), the wood needed for a year was brought in on a particular day - the fourteenth day of the fifth month  - which was kept as a festival, and known as the "Xylophoria." <span class="cmt_word">At times appointed year by year</span>. It may be gathered from this that, originally, no single day was selected for bringing in all the wood; much less one and the same day appointed for every year. The original system was variable and elastic; but in course of time a rigid uniformity was introduced and established. <span class="cmt_word">As it is written in the law</span>.

As with the law of first-fruits, so with that of tithes (which was more burthensome), there had grown up a practice of neglecting it on the part of  many, if not of all. The natural result  would be the non-attendance of Levites at  Jerusalem, and so a falling-off in the  solemnity and grandeur of the temple-worship (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>). It was now  covenanted afresh on the part of the people  that they would resume the legal practice,  at any rate to the extent of paying what has  been called "the first tithe," or that due to  the Levites for their sustentation. <span class="cmt_word">In all  the cities of our tillage</span>. The Levitical tithe  was not taken to Jerusalem. but stored up in  some neighbouring, generally Levitical, city. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a></div><div class="verse">And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest  shall be with the Levites when the Levites take tithe</span>. Some representative (or representatives) of the priestly order was to be present whenever the Levites received their tithes, to take note of the quantity, and prevent the Levites from depriving the priests of their due share  - <span class="cmt_word">the tithe of the tithe</span>. This tenth, being thus ascertained, was to be conveyed to Jerusalem at the expense of the Levites, and deposited in its appropriate store-chamber. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a></div><div class="verse">For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where <i>are</i> the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering.</span> The priests were not to be troubled with the conveyance of any of the offerings. The first-fruits and other oblations of the people were to be brought to the temple by the people themselves; and the "tithe of the tithe,' which was the priests' due, by the Levites. Thus the priests would not be drawn away from their duty of ministering in the temple by secular employments and matters of mere worldly business. <span class="cmt_word">We will not forsake, or neglect, the house of our God</span>. We will not suffer, that is, any interruption of the continual service of the temple, we will not be parties to any neglect or slovenliness in the conduct of it. So far as we are concerned, everything shall be done to enable the priests and Levites to remain constantly at Jerusalem in full numbers, and to devote themselves wholly to their sacred duties in God's house. With this emphatic declaration of their intentions the people concluded the engagements by which they voluntarily bound themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
