The coincidence of the Passover feast and the killing of the Paschal lamb, with the sacrifice of "Christ our Passover," cannot be concealed. [For the grammatical construction with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, cf. note, <a href="../../par/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a>, where a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> occurs; not, however, a Latinism, as some have supposed, as similar phrases are found in good Greek (see Winer, ' Greek Gram.,' p. 69).] The date from which the calculation is made is complicated with the intricate controversy upon the day of our Lord's death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he suffered on the 14th or 15th of Nisan, and whether a "harmony" is possible or not with the statements of the synoptists, who all three assert that our Lord ate the Passover with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 92-94.). However this matter be finally settled, if the 14th of Nisan was the day on which the Passover was killed, "between the evenings," the 13th was reckoned as the first day before the Passover, and the sixth day would be the 8th of Nisan. If the weekly sabbath occurred on the 16th, then the 9th also was a sabbath. The Lord would then have reached Bethany on the <span class="accented">eve</span> of the sabbath, and have rested on the sabbath itself. The evening of the 9th would be the occasion of the feast, and the 10th would correspond with Palm Sunday. If the Lord were crucified on the 14th, and the weekly sabbath coincided with the Passover-day of convocation, the 15th, then the previous sabbath was on the 8th, and our Lord must have reached Bethany in "the end of the sabbath," and then the feast was on the following day. When Jesus halted at Bethany, the vast crowd of pilgrims advanced into the suburbs of Jerusalem, encamping on the Mount of Olives, and would be ready for the great demonstration of the next day. Westcott, after Bengel, observes that John's Gospel begins and ends with a sacred week (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-35, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">Jesus therefore, sis days before the Passover, <span class="cmt_word"></span>came to Bethany</span>. The quiet rest of that last sabbath with the family at Bethany is a thought full of suggestion. Thoma accounts for the triumphal feast and anointing, "six days before the Passover," as answering to the day on which the lamb was separated from other and secular animals, and consecrated for this holy service (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>). The segregation, however, was partial or premature, and the anointing (see below) took place five days before the Passover. It is not said that the day of his arrival at Bethany is the day of the festive welcome. Bethany is described as <span class="cmt_word">the place where Lazarus was.</span> The explanatory clause, <span class="cmt_word">he who had been dead</span>, is not necessary, as the evangelist limits and explains sufficiently the great motive for his pause and presence at Bethany by adding, <span class="cmt_word">whom he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">raised from the dead.</span> It is extraordinary that some most able expositors should be so unwilling to accept the synchronous statements of the synoptists. Their narrative is not out of harmony with the hypothesis that our Lord passed the previous days with the pilgrim-band from Peraea, and that, taking the head of the procession as it was passing through Jericho., he should thus have distinctly challenged the authorities, and taken up the public position to which they were anxious he should lay claim. By his visit to the house of Zacchaeus he proclaimed the new feature and spirit of his kingdom; by healing the blind man he gave a typical illustration of the work of grace needed by all his disciples; by resting at the home where human love and Divine power had been so wonderfully blended he called the most solemn attention to his supreme claims; by pressing on with urgency up the steep mountain pathway at the head of his disciples he seemed to be ready, in his own words, "to lay down his life, that he might take it again." The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Meyer, is simply the resumption of the narrative, but surely those are right who regard it as a distinct reference to <a href="../../par/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>. The Sanhedrists had given the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> that if any knew where he was, they should declare it. Christ was resolved, now that his hour was come, to lift the whole responsibility from his friends, and <span class="accented">take</span> it upon himself. The other evangelists do not mention the halt. Their purpose was not a chronological one. They give the narrative of the anointing apart from its deepest meanings and consequences, apart from any references to Lazarus (see <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-12</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1-11</a>). There are other subtle omissions from the synoptists, the difficulties of which must be settled as <span class="accented">between themselves</span>. Thus, according to <a href="../../par/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a> and 20, an interval of a whole day and night took place between the withering of the fig tree and the conversation about it, but Matthew makes the conversation follow immediately upon the miracle. In like manner, John abstains from any reference to the discussions in the temple, to the withering of the fig tree, to the cleansing of the temple, or to the parables which followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There, therefore, they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him</span>. John does not tell us in whose house "they made the dinner" or supper, and unless Simon the leper (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) is a member of the family (or, as some suggest, the husband of Martha), we cannot suppose that it was in the quiet home of Bethany that this feast in honor of Jesus was held, but that it took place, as the synoptists positively declare, "in the house of Simon the leper." Simon may easily have been one of the many lepers whom our Lord had healed, and whose soul was filled with accordant gratitude. At that table there would be seated two transcendent; proofs of the power of Jesus to save, not only from the semblance but from the reality of death (see Meyer; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>). We wonder, with Godet, that Meyer should reject this simple supposition as "spurious harmony." All that is here stated is in agreement with it: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Martha should have shown her reverence by serving her  Lord, according to her wont, not necessarily as hostess (Hengstenberg and Lange), but as the expression of her devoted thankfulness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Lazarus should have been one of those who sat at meat, reclined at table, with him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> took a position as a guest, like himself; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Mary should have poured forth her costly spikenard, in royal self-forgetting love. The conduct of all the three thus mentioned is compatible with the fact stated in the synoptic narrative, that the festival was celebrated in the house of Simon the leper. Our Lord had commented, in the house of Simon the Pharisee (<a href="../../par/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44</a>, etc.), on the absence of the customary anointing with oil. Mary knew of this, and resolved that, whatever the woman who was a sinner had done, no similar act of neglect should occur on that memorable evening. A chronological discrepancy renders an identification of the synoptic narrative of Matthew with this story perplexing. In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a> we are brought to within two days of the Passover, whereas here we cannot well be less than five days before it. However, there is nothing in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a> which indubitably declares the date of the <span class="accented">supper</span> The "two days" may refer to the date of Judas's treachery, after mentioning which he goes back to an event which furnished occasion and temptation to the avaricious mind of Judas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mary therefore took a pound</span> (the synoptists Matthew and Mark say "an alabaster," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a flask made of the costly spar, which was peculiarly adapted to the preservation of liquid perfume, hermetically sealed before it was broken for immediate use. The fact, as stated by Matthew and Mark, is inconsistent with her reserving any of the precious fluid for another occasion) <span class="cmt_word">of ointment</span> ("liquid perfume," sometimes added to the more ordinary oil), <span class="cmt_word">of pure</span> (or possibly; <span class="accented">pistie</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>nard</span>. Mark uses this unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which belongs to later Greek. The derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, equivalent to "potable," is not appropriate in meaning, though this "nard" was used for perfuming wine. In <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> also the Authorized Version translates it "spikenard," as it does here (cf. also <a href="../../par/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a> and Song 4:13, 14, where Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). But the one place where the word was supposed to be found in Aristotle is now seen not to be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, trustworthy, or unadulterated. It is possible that the word may have had a local geographical value, belonging to some proper name, and is untranslatable. <span class="cmt_word">Very precious.</span> Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, and Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. John appears to combine the idea of both words in his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Each of the synoptists severally mentions a fact which John omits - that Mary <span class="accented">broke</span> the alabaster box, and poured the costly unguent on his head in rich abundance, as though hers had been the royal or high-priestly anointing (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>.); but John shows that this at least was not all she did. <span class="cmt_word">She anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> Thoma thinks that, conformably with John's idea, the anointing of the head of the true High Priest was the work of God alone, quoting Philo's comment on <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, etc., "The head of the Logos, as High Priest, is anointed with oil, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his innermost essence gleams with dazzling light;" and adds, that as the feet of the high priest were washed with water from recent defilement of the world's dust, so God's anointed Lamb and Priest was anointed on his feet with the spikenard of faith, the best and costliest thing that man could offer. So profound an analogy seems to us contrary to the simplicity of the narrative, which is perfectly natural in its form. The perfumed nard ran down to the Savior's feet and the skirts of his garments, and there accumulating, the significant act is further recounted how Mary wiped off the superfluous perfume from his feet with the tresses of her loosened hair. This simple act proclaimed the self-humiliation and adoration of her unbounded love, seeing that the loosening of a woman's hair was a mark of unusual self-abandonment, Many most unnecessary inferences have been drawn from this. John adds an interesting feature, revealing the sensitive eye-witness of the scene, "and the house <span class="accented">was filled with the odor of the ointment</span>;" and the whole house of God ever since has been fragrant with her immortal and prophetic act. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, which should betray him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Judas the Iscariot, one of his disciples</span><span class="cmt_word">, who was about to betray him, said.</span> The speaker here is singled out by name. Matthew refers the speech to the disciples generally, in whom the suggestion of Judas had stirred up (without guile or blame on their part) a not unnatural inquiry. Mark says "some" murmured to themselves, "Why this waste?" (loss, destruction). John (without the malice which Renan has attributed to the writer) mentions the source of the suggestion, "Judas Iscariot, Simon's son." The word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, contained in T.R., is omitted here in the best texts. The fact that he was the traitor, being one of the well-known and awful events of the gospel history when John wrote some half a century later, might well be introduced by the evangelist, with no other than a purely historical motive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span> Sinful motive often hides itself under the mask of reverence for another virtue. In Mark's Gospel the same price was put upon the pound of pure nard as that which is mentioned here - about  of our money. Christ had given emphatic advice about generosity to the poor, and even during this very week (<a href="../../par/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>) it is clear that his words were not forgotten, and in his great discourse, probably also delivered during this same week, he identified himself with the poor (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, etc.), and called for unreserved consideration of them; so that this language was not unnatural. The value of this ointment is another minute indication that there is no connection between the Lazarus of John and the Lazarus of the parable. But John adds that the utter lack of perception on Judas's part of Mary's self-devotion was prompted by the most unworthy motive. The suggestion of Judas is put down by the evangelist to the sheerest covetousness. During the interval that elapsed, Judas had revealed his character, and John did not hesitate to refer the suggestion to the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor</span>. He really cared nothing for the poor. He was ambitious, eager for the display of the Master's power, anxious for the rewards which might follow the Master's assumption of supreme authority, turning to his own account all that might happen. <span class="cmt_word">But because he was a thief, and having</span> <span class="cmt_word">possession of the common purse</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in the sense of a chest (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), has a curious etymology, which had passed out of recognition; from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> comes <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, that in which month-pieces of flutes might be kept in safety, and subsequently a chest or box for the safe guardianship of other valuables), <span class="cmt_word">he was the bearer</span> - perhaps, <span class="accented">bore array</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>, and Josephus, ' Ant.,' 7:15. 3, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>), at all events had at his disposal - <span class="cmt_word">of the things which were cast</span>, in generous profusion, into it. Thoma makes the astounding suggestion that "John" here covertly refers to Simon Magus of <a href="../../par/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18</a>, etc. The question is often asked - Why was Judas entrusted with the common purse? Was it not likely to aggravate a disposition to which he was prone? Did not Jesus know what was in man? and had he not discerned the propensity of Judas (see <a href="../../par/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>)? In reply: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The appointment may have been made by the apostles themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our Lord may not have interfered with it, deeming confidence more likely to help him than distrust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It may also show how, if men will yield themselves to sin, God will not and does not promise them immunity from temptation, but sometimes even brings them into it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The purse might have been a preservative against the vile temptation to sell his Master, and a test and motive for self-con-quest.

This is, in one sense, that very day, and she has found out the solemn fact in a way in which the disciples had as yet failed to do. With this agrees the language of the synoptists," Why trouble ye the woman? she hath wrought a good work on me;...  she hath done that which was possible to her (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)" of <a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>. In fact, Mark expressly conveys this thought - "she has anticipated the anointing of my body for the burial."  If we have the direct testimony of Mark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Peter), Christ must have expressed himself thus.  Matthew also in different words records the same pathetic and subtle thought: "For in that she poured [cast] this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial" (John 26:12) Hengstenberg, Godet, and Stier abide by the reading of the T.R.; but the principal manuscripts, in most powerful combination, have led Lachmann, Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort to read here, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "In order that she may keep or guard this for the day of my burial." Westcott says that the synoptists imply rather, by the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that She had not already consumed the whole of the ointment. Meyer, with this text, translates, "Let her alone, that she may preserve it (this ointment, of which she has just poured some over my feet) for the day of my embalmment." This certainly seems inconsistent with the complaint of the disciples or of Judas, at the apparently superfluous expenditure, and would compel us to restrict the <span class="accented">abed to</span> the unused portion. The advocates of the T.R. reading say that it represents the original text, which has been altered by criticism arising from misunderstanding of the idea of the day of burial having ideally arrived; but why did they not alter on the same principle the language of the synoptists? The advocates of Lachmann's text say that it has been altered by copyists, to bring it into accord with the text of the synoptists. Lange justifies the Revised Version, "Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying," and puts it thus: "Permit her to keep it [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to have kept the ointment which she might have used at the burial of Lazarus] for the day of my burial," now ideally present in the outbreak of Judas's devilish malignity. So virtually Luthardt and Baumgarten-Crusius. Godet argues that this is forced and ungrammatical. But there is this advantage in it, that it brings the language into much closer relation with the synoptists. Westcott prefers the idea of Meyer. The older view is to me far mere satisfactory. Edersheim (2:35) adds to this, "Mary may have had that alabaster box from early days, before she had learned to serve Christ. When she understood that <span class="accented">decease</span> of which he constantly spake, she may have put it aside, "kept it," "against the day of his burying." And now the decisive hour is come.

As though he had said, "After this very night, the opportunity to offer me affectionate attention or symbolic homage, to give expression to feelings in accordance with just presentiments as to my mission, will be over forever, and belong to the irrecoverable past - <span class="accented">Now</span> <span class="accented">or never!</span> She has done this thing, she will have everlasting remembrance thereby." The frankincense of the Wise Men, the ointment of Mary, the homage of the Greeks, were symbols, and can never be repeated. The greatest motive for generous and affectionate interest in the poor is that they represent the Lord; but they are not to be rivals of the Lord himself. Westcott remarks, "The promise of the future record of the act of love is omitted by the one evangelist who gives the name of the woman who showed this devotion to her Master." Moulton, "The very charity that cares for the poor whom we see has been kept alive by faith in and devotion to the crucified Redeemer whom we cannot see."

We gather from the synoptic narrative that he had joined the pilgrim-throng, advancing first into Jericho, and then, after a night spent there, had moved onwards to Bethany. The dispersion of hundreds of these excited followers into Jerusalem had again bruited abroad the fact of the resurrection of Lazarus, and, by reason of the Lord's return to Bethany, the Jerusalem-party at length learned where he was. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> shows an antithesis intended between the Judaean and the Galilean crowds.

And now the hour had come (<a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>), but not until our Lord once more warned the disciples with intense significance and explicitness of his approaching death and burial. Thus another striking illustration is given of the judgment, the <span class="accented">crisis</span>, the sifting process, which is always going on in the presence of Christ. His greatest signs, his wisest teachings, his most amazing love, bring out the twofold result. Some receive, some reject, some burst into louder acclaim, some try to slay. As with the history of this "Gospel," some hear in it the very voice of the Eternal, but there are others who would grind it to powder. Because Ignatius and Polycarp bear witness to the existence of the Gospel, these Lazaruses must be put to death, or banished to a later period out of harm's way. Even the genuineness of the Apocalypse, so long a tower of defense for the T&uuml;bingen school, is too powerful a proof of St. John's residence in Asia to be accepted with equanimity or left in possession, and some of the later critics have taken counsel to repudiate its Johannine authorship.

(On the differences between John's account of this transaction and that of the synoptic narrative, cf. commentaries, <a href="../../par/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-44</a>.) On the precise order of events it is difficult to speak with absolute decision. The main difference between the synoptists and John is in the break at Bethany of the journey from Jericho to Jerusalem, to introduce a feast, which is related afterwards by the synoptists, though not <span class="accented">limited</span> by them to any later chronological position. It should be observed, moreover, that the synoptic narrative contains numerous references to the residence in Bethany during several days of the week (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) which followed. John adds important details, and while he omits the great discussions in the temple, the withering of the fig tree, the cleansing of the temple, the parables of the judgments on scribes and Pharisees, and the prophecy of the future, he portrays the inner life of the Lord, and records his most gracious esoteric teaching and sublime prayer. The current tradition of the Church, the distinct note of time for Christ's arrival at Bethany (six days before the Passover), make the triumphal entry take place on Sunday afternoon (cf. ver. 1) of Passion week. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day</span> (on the morrow) must be the day after the feast. We have seen that that feast probably took place on the evening of the sabbath. The events that happened are far more abundantly described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke - the excitement in Jerusalem, the method in which the triumph was carried through, the mode adopted to secure "the young ass," the weeping ever Jerusalem from the summit of the hill; none of these circumstances are inconsistent with this account. Brief, however, as our narrative is, it adds some features which are peculiar and highly historic. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">vast crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> These that had come from the country, and had already encamped near or in Jerusalem, came group after group to Bethany to escort him into the city. The synoptists, not mentioning the pause of the sabbath at Bethany, and not clearly indicating where and when the feast at Bethany took place, naturally connect the journey from Jericho with the entrance into Jerusalem. John explains, in addition, that there were of the Jerusalemites themselves certain who had been led to go to Bethany and throw in their lot with the Lord. The early pilgrims mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55, 56</a>, also came forth from the city to hail and welcome his approach. Took branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him. The synoptists had mentioned that the triumphant host had cut "branches," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>), from the trees, and Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>) had said <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, fragments of trees, grass, small branches, that could be strewn in the way. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/19-35.htm">Luke 19:35</a>) simply mentions the <span class="accented">garments</span> thus strewn - a fact mentioned also by Mark and Matthew. Our narrative gives greater definiteness, and even adds a new feature, by speaking of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the palm branches of the palm trees," which they waved probably in triumph, as they had been accustomed to do in token of the approach of a conqueror (cf. 1 Macc. 13:51, where Simon's return to the city was celebrated with "thanksgiving and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and with harps and cymbals," etc.). The use to which the branches of the well-known palm trees were put, differs from, but does not exclude, the use to which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were also put. Bethany (see note, <a href="../../par/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1</a>) was "the house of dates," and the palm branches for the Feast of Tabernacles, on its first celebration after the Captivity (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), Were fetched from <span class="accented">the</span> mount (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). The palm tree was a sacred symbol for Israel "Tamar," a palm <span class="accented">tree</span>, was a favorite name for a woman. The Maccabaean coins were decorated with the palm and vine. The medal struck by Titus represented a captive sitting under a palm. Throughout their history, in their gorgeous temple ritual, it continually reappears, and at the last the Apocalypse represents the victorious songs of triumphant elders accompanied by the waving of the palm. If we compare the four accounts of the demonstration, we shall see again how in combination they vividly represent the whole scene. The multitude cry, according to - <a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest." <a href="../../par/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9, 10</a>: "Hosanna; Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest." <a href="../../par/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a>, remembering the angel's song: "They praised God with a loud voice....  Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord: in heaven peace, and glory in the highest." John says they went forth to meet him, palm branch in hand, and cried, <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, and</span> (blessed be) <span class="cmt_word">(even) the King of Israel.</span> These differences show how various groups used with freedom the tones and sentiment of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, adopting the welcome with which the priests were accustomed to greet the pilgrims to the festival. But each account demonstrates that, on this occasion, there was a general ascription to our Lord of Messianic honor. He is hailed by the people as King of Israel, as the Head of the coming kingdom of their father David, and as giving glory to God. <span class="accented">The Name of the Lord</span> is the manifestation and compendium of all the perfections of the Lord. For centuries the gracious hope had rung forth in the sacred liturgy, and now the people see that the hope is on the point of realization.

The foal implies that the animal had never borne another burden. The account of Matthew refers to the mother and the foal, as though they were inseparable, and together bore the sacred burden. Mr. Holman Hunt, in his picture of the 'Triumph of the Innocents,' has represented the beast bearing Mary and her Child as accompanied by the colt. The entire process of securing both must have taken time, and augmented the excitement. Christ at length, on the eve of his Passion which he so distinctly foreshadowed, allowed the enthusiasm of the people to prevail, and accepted the homage. The Galilee pilgrims take up the demonstration, which was commenced, as we see from John's Gospel, by "the Jews" and those Jerusalemites who had been profoundly moved by the significance of the resurrection of Lazarus. The circumstances thus elucidated from the four narratives, reveal undesigned coincidences. The entry into Jerusalem did not take place till the afternoon, and so we find that all that our Lord did on arrival was to "go to the temple, look round on all things, and, now that the even was come, to revisit Bethany with the twelve" (<a href="../../par/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - John, as well as Matthew, sees here a symbolical fulfillment of what had been declared by one of the latest of the prophets, as the peculiarity of the Messiah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>): <span class="cmt_word">Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt</span>. This oracle is admitted by commentators of opposite schools to refer to the Messiah. There was no need, in order to fulfill the spirit of the whole passage, that the King should come to his own <span class="accented">literally</span> upon the back of a beast of burden. The prophecy does, however, suggest the modesty, the absence of all pomp or display of worldly wealth and power; nay, the humiliation on the part of the true King. Both Matthew and John omit the characteristics of "righteous and saved," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "delivered" from the hands of his cruel enemies. The suffering Servant of God of the great oracle of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. was in the mind of the Prophet Zechariah, and he adds this feature to the triumphant coming of the true Prince of Peace, that he would "cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so act that even the national pride and power and military prowess should come to an end; "Speak peace to the nations; rule from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth." As John and Matthew both see the symbolical fulfillment of the prophecy, they doubtless would have us bear in mind the whole passage. John transforms the "Rejoice greatly, shout," etc., of the prophet into "<span class="accented">Fear not</span>." He seems to take it at one stage only of fulfillment, when anxiety might momentarily be put to rest. The "<span class="accented">Fear</span> not" is a lower form of "great rejoicing." It is something for men to dismiss their doubts and hush their unrest, even when they cannot burst into song. Hengstenberg and Godet urge that the "meekness and lowliness" to which the prophet referred, and which Matthew cited from him, was imaged in the lowly beast on which never man sat. But it must not be forgotten that the ass was used by distinguished personages (<a href="../../par/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a>). And all that was really meant by it was the choice of a creature associated rather with daily life than with military display. Meyer and Moulton urge that it was a chosen symbol of peace (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> substituted for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> of the LXX. and <a href="../../par/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). Contrary to Keim's animadversion, our Lord and his disciples adopted here the idea of a Jewish Messiah, stripping it of its worldly characteristics. It should be observed that, while John's narrative is in harmony with the synoptists, he greatly abbreviates it.

The interrogative may also be a true translation. <span class="accented">Do ye perceive that ye prevail nothing?</span> On either hypothesis, it cannot be, as Chrysostom says, the language of the friends of Jesus among the Pharisees, but rather the cry of despair and rage. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">world has gone away after him.</span> They are repenting that they had not followed out the coercive plans and murderous designs of Caiaphas, and had been content with half-measures.

They went up with a view to worship in the feast, that is, there were burnt offerings and thank offerings which they were allowed to present. This shows that they were not heathen nor uncircumcised Hellenists, whichever view of that word be accepted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a></div><div class="verse">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus</span>. The first expression of that great yearning which, swollen by multitudes without number, is loud as the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings. It is the wail of every penitent; it is the birth-cry of every renewed soul; it is the raptured burst of joy as each son of God passes behind the veil The "therefore" implies some kind of previous relation with <span class="accented">Philip</span>, whose somewhat timid, cautious, speculative mind, as hinted in the earlier portions of the Gospel, made him accessible to them. Personal acquaintance is, of course, possible. Was Philip identical with the Aristion of Papias (see Introduction, p. 34, and Archdeacon Farrar, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, November, 1881)? The mention of Bethsaida of Galilee confirms the suggestion that they were inhabitants of one of the Greek cities of Decapolis, or of the slopes of the Lebanon. Many commentators refer to Philip's Greek name as indicating proclivities or sympathies on his part which would make him peculiarly accessible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a></div><div class="verse">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The slight modification of text preferred by the Revised Version gives great vivacity to the picture (see below, note 1). Philip receives the respectful request of the Greeks, "Sir [my lord], we would see Jesus," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "converse with." They probably sought to bring some proposal before him. Surely they must have had, if they wished it, many opportunities of merely <span class="accented">seeing</span> Jesus, when he crossed the Mount of Olivet during those three days, or tarried in the court of the Gentiles; now they pressed for an interview. <span class="cmt_word">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew.</span> Andrew was the earliest of the disciples, who brought his own brother Simon to Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>). He is mentioned as in close association with Simon, James, and John, as partners with them in the fishing-trade on the lake of Galilee (see <a href="../../par/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16, 29</a>, and Mark 3:18, compared with <a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). There is some hint that Andrew and John, after the first call to become followers of Christ, clung to him, and went with him to Jerusalem, and then returned with him through Samaria, after which occurred the second call of the brothers <span class="accented">Simon</span> and <span class="accented">James</span>. The frequent references to Andrew and Philip in this Gospel correspond with the tradition preserved in the <span class="accented">Muratorian Fragment on the Canon</span>, touching Andrew's part in the composition of this Gospel. These two disciples are represented as consulting with each other on previous occasions, as though peculiarly related in sympathy. Philip sees certain difficulties, and Andrew has a practical mind, and proposes a way out of them (see <a href="../../par/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7, 8</a>). There was something now to be said on both sides. Their ancient prophecies anticipated a world-wide aspect of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 7</a>; as well as <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Now, if this incident occurred after Jesus had claimed the hundred and tenth psalm as an oracle which described his own Divine claims and his universal victory as the Lord and Son of David and royal Warrior-Prest (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>, and parallel passages), Philip may have felt this moment to be a most critical one in his history; for he may have been perfectly aware of the outbreak of peril which converse with Greek proselytes might at that moment have provoked in the minds of the turbulent populace. <span class="cmt_word">Andrew cometh and Philip, and they</span> (together) <span class="cmt_word">tell Jesus</span>. Jesus alone could solve the difficulty at that time, and Jesus himself is the just and reasonable Source of all enlightenment. Jesus is at this hour the highest Expression of man and his destiny, and he is also the perfect Manifestation of the Father, the only Mediator between God and man, absolutely one with both. We still go to him to know what God is and what God would have us to think and to be, and to learn what man may become. We take to him the puzzles of our logic, the accusations of our conscience, and the burdens of our heart. Additional interest is thrown round this narrative by a suggestion of Archdeacon Watkins, that, in the course of this week, our Lord had cleansed the temple and courts of its profane traffic, and declared it to be a <span class="accented">house of prayer for all nations</span>. Such grand revolutionary conceptions as those of our Lord must have deeply stirred the souls of the susceptible Greeks. Aliens were, as we know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11.5), forbidden to pass beyond the balustrade round the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,. M. Ganneau has found among the ruins of Jerusalem one of the slabs of stone which recorded this exclusion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man in and through death</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus answereth</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. Many commentators (Ewald, Godet, Hengstenberg) think that Jesus did not address the following words to the Greeks, that until he had gone through the agony of death, and entered in human nature on his Divine and mediatorial reign, the mission to the Gentiles could not commence. Tholuck supposed that the interview was over, and that the solemn words are addressed to the disciples in the presence both of Greeks and of others <span class="accented">afterwards</span>; but there is no such break suggested. It is more probable (with Luthardt, Edersheim, Lunge) that the Greeks were close behind Andrew and Philip, and that our Lord at once, for <span class="accented">their</span> advantage, as well as for that of the disciples, proceeded to explain the solemn impression made upon himself by this remarkable desire. Surely it is unnecessary to say that our Lord was anxious not to give umbrage to the priests, or to rouse the animosity of the people. Every word of the terrible address of <a href="../../par/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, all the controversies in the temple, even the triumphal entry itself, would and did give mortal umbrage to the priestly party and to the Sanhedrim He had boldly challenged their entire position, he had smitten down their prejudices and assailed their notions of exclusive privilege, and therefore would not have shrunk, on that ground, from intercourse with devout Greeks worshipping at the feast. The words are surely said <span class="accented">to</span> them and <span class="accented">about</span> them, but in the main for the instruction of the disciples themselves. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is come</span> for which he had been waiting (see <a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>)-the mysterious "hour" on which his glory would depend, and the destiny of the world turn. God not only contemplates great periods, eons of time, but "acceptable years," "days of the Lord," "moments of time," as parts of the eternal plan. That the Son of man should be glorified. The "Son of man," rather than "Son of God," is the term he uses in reference to, and in the presence of, the Greeks. The highest Man is now about to assume his supreme glory, to go forth, as the mighty Man, to rule the world of men. The Son of man is about to ascend into his eternal throne, to clothe himself with all authority of judgment and mercy in heaven and earth. The glorification of the Son of man is one of the high main themes of the Gospel, and its justification is to be found in the fact that the Son of man is indeed the Logos made flesh, and the Lamb slain, and like the Serpent is being lifted up, and as the true Shepherd is laying down his life that he might take it again. The advent of the Greeks opens prophetic vistas which involve tremendous experiences of his own, and also great principles of service for all his followers. His Passion was so inextricably interwoven with his glory, that the former becomes verily the prelude of his victory and supreme exaltation. His death is but his glory. Moreover, the approach of the Gentiles suggested the universal belief in him which would follow upon his Passion and resurrection, and he" foretells that the hour of his glorification was already come" (Augustine). (See remarks in Introduction, pp. 78-80, on the several epochs in this record of the Lord's life, where the "hour" seems to strike, but is again and again postponed with a view to fresh revelations, exactly as the climax is deferred throughout the Apocalypse.)

"Even nature protests against the Hellenic fear of death" (Lange). As long as the corn of wheat is scrupulously kept from decomposition and death in the granary, the hidden germ is dormant; let it be sown as "bare grain" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-36.htm">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>, etc.), then the strange force within it puts forth its hidden faculty, the outer covering of this point of energy falls away, and the new thing appears. God gives it a body, and much fruit is brought forth. Thoma suggests that the Johannist here is putting into the lips of Jesus the thoughts of Paul. How much more probable is it that Paul grasped the thought of Jesus, and applied a part of it to the grand argument for the resurrection, both of Christ and Christians! Compare with this the teaching of <a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, where the Bread of life is given for the food of men. Even the "bread-making" for man involves, in another way, the temporary destruction of the living germ in the grain of which it is composed, that it may become the life of men. Christ is himself the "Son of God," the "Logos incarnate," the "Son of man." By becoming, in his death, the food of man's soul, he created thus a new life in the hearts of men. Over and over again our Lord has declared himself to be "the Life," and "the Source of life," for men; but he here lays down the principle that this life-giving power of his is conditioned by his death. The great  harvest will be reaped only when he shall have sacrificed his life and put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. It is, too, only as every believing man dies to himself, is crucified with Christ, is dead with him to the world, that he rises again in the newness of life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - The Lord here introduces a solemn, almost oracular utterance, which proves how close and intimate is the relationship between the synoptics and the Fourth Gospel. On several great occasions our Lord has impressed this law of the Spirit of life upon his disciples. Thus in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37-39</a>, in the lengthened commission given to the twelve, after calling on his followers to place his own claim on their affection as greater than that of father, mother, friend, and calling for self-sacrifice, and self-crucifixion, he said, "He that findeth his life (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>) shall lose it: he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." Again (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>, etc.), after rebuking Peter for his unwillingness to recognize the necessity and significance of the killing of "the Son of the living God," he laid down the same law once more, calling for self-denial and daily cross-bearing, and adds, "Whosoever will <span class="accented">save</span> his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it." So also <a href="../../par/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, etc. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/15-26.htm">Luke 15:26</a>) also introduces the same solemn aphorism in our Lord's discourse concerning the close of the Jewish national life. Surely here he is applying to his own case the law of the Divine life which he had shown to be universal, and of which he was on the point of giving the crowning and climacteric expression. He does it with amplifications and a supply of motives. If life be regarded as an end in itself; if it be treated as complete when rounded with its own individuality; if life shrink from sacrifice, if it "love itself," and will at all hazards preserve itself; if the natural and instinctive fear of death, and instinct of self-preservation, become a self-idolatry; - that life will "abide alone." If it sacrifice itself for higher ends than self; if it regard the higher end as more valuable than itself; if it lose itself in the object to which it is consecrated; if it be content to "die;" - it abideth no longer "alone," but "bringeth forth much fruit." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loves his own life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>); life used as equivalent to "self," in that totality of being which, like the life of the seed-corn, survives the accident of death  - <span class="cmt_word">he that loves his own life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word">is</span> losing</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>; or, perhaps, destroying it, <span class="accented">ipso facto</span>. There are ends and objects of love so much greater than" the self," that to keep it by some act of will and recreant fear is to make it utterly valueless, is really to destroy its true vitality. <span class="cmt_word">And he that hateth his</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in this world</span>, wherever the greater claim of Christ and of the Father would be compromised by loving it, <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> veritably <span class="cmt_word">preserve it</span>, viz. the self, <span class="cmt_word">unto eternal</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the blessedness of eternal being. The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is a great possession; and "what advantageth a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose it?" But if a man persists in gaining the world, and forgets that this earthly existence is not capable of satisfying the demands or finding a sphere for the true self, and so makes the earthly reign or enjoyment of the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the end of all striving, - then he miserably fails. So far it is clear that our Lord is applying a great principle of the true life to the case of his own Messianic work and ministry. He draws, from a law of the superiority of the Divine life to the fear of death and to the fact of death, a justification of his own approaching doom. He can only by dying live his perfect life, win his greatest triumph; reap his world-wide harvest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a></div><div class="verse">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - In this verse the Lord brings the light of heaven down into this deep paradox. He speaks like an anointed King and great Captain of salvation, who has (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) "servants" willing to do his bidding. <span class="cmt_word">If any man will be my servant, let him follow me</span> along the line which I am prepared to take, in the way of sacrifice and death, which is the true glorification; <span class="cmt_word">and where I am, there shall also my servant be</span>. This association of the servant with the Lord, as the sufficient and the transcendent motive, pervades the Gospels (cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a> and John 17:24; comp. also <a href="../../par/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, "with me in Paradise;" and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). It is remarkable that Christ chose the twelve that they should be "with him" (<a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>). There is no greater blessedness. Still, the Lord adds, <span class="cmt_word">If any man serve me, him will the Father honor.</span> For the Father to honor a poor child of the dust seems almost more than we can receive. The conception of the steps by means of which the Lord makes this possible to his followers and servants produced in his own self-consciousness one of those sudden and overwhelming crises and changes from joy to perturbation, as of agony to peace and to reconcilement with the eternal Father's will, which prove how certainly St. John is always portraying the same Personage, the same transcendent character whom the synoptists describe (<a href="../../par/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49, 50</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, etc., and 21). More than this, the whole passage that follows is a solemn prelude to that agony of the garden which the synoptists alone record, while they omit this. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a></div><div class="verse">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?

In <a href="../../par/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a> we hear that he troubled himself, and shuddered wrathfully in his "spirit" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at the contemplation of all the evils and curse of death; now his whole <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his life centered in its corporeal environment as a man, the self which the Son of God had taken up into the Divine essence, was in depth of agony, preluding the strong crying and tears to which <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> refers. These perturbations of his soul and spirit can only be accounted for by the uniqueness of his Personality, the capacity for suffering, and the extent to which he was identifying himself with the sinful nature with which he had invested himself. Sin is the sting of death. He had by the nature of his incarnation become sin for us. Martyrs, freed from sin, delivered from its curse and shame and power through him, face it with calmness and hope; but there was infinite space in his breast for all the curse of it to rain its horrible tempest. He felt that the hour of his extremest travail had come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And what shall I</span> (must I) <span class="cmt_word">say</span>? What is the regal passion of my heart? What is the right revelation for me to make to you? What is the prayer for me to offer to the Father? It remains a great question whether the next utterance is the primary answer of the question itself, or whether it continues the interrogation - whether, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Lord lifts up for a moment the cry of heart-rending grief, <span class="accented">Father, save me from this hour!</span> or whether he said, <span class="accented">Shall I say, Father, save me from this hour?</span> The first view supposes in the first place actual uncertainty and awful bewilderment, and then a most intense cry (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to him who was able to save him from death. Save me either from the death itself, or from the fear and horror which accompanies it (Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, and Moulton). <span class="accented">It</span> need not be a prayer to leave the world unsaved, to sacrifice all the work on which he had come. We are told by the apostle (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) that he was "heard" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and delivered from human weakness which might have rebelled in the intolerable darkness of that hour. <span class="cmt_word">Father, save me from this hour</span>; the equivalent to the prayer, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," with its grand "nevertheless," etc. If this be its meaning, we have a scene nearly, if not closely, identifiable with the agony of the garden. The correction which immediately follows augments the comparison with the scene in Gethsemane recorded by the synoptists. The R.T. and Revised Version have put their note of interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> into the margin, and not into the text. Ewald, Lange, Kling, Tholuck, Lachmann, accept this punctuation, and Godet regards it as an hypothetical prayer, although he does not place the interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The self-interrogation of the previous utterance at least reveals the presence of such a desire, but one which vanishes as the mysterious hour engulfs and wraps him round. If this be the true interpretation, then the clause that follows must be, <span class="cmt_word">Nay</span> this <span class="cmt_word">I</span> cannot say, for on account of this very conflict - <span class="cmt_word">for this cause</span> - only to fight this great battle - <span class="cmt_word">I came</span> steadily forward <span class="cmt_word">to this hour</span>. I cannot pray to escape from it. If, however, we have the expression of an actual though momentary prayer, and if we give it the meaning, "bring me safely through and out of this hour," it corresponds with the Divine trust in the Father's love which, in the extremity of the anguish and desertion, he yet reveals, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> becomes equivalent to "Pray, this I need not say; the end is known" (Westcott). I know that I shall be delivered, <span class="accented">for this cause, viz</span>. <span class="accented">that</span> I should encounter and pass through the hour I came into the world, and have reached the final crisis. This is, to my mind, more satisfactory; the interrogative prayer gives a sentimental character to the utterance out of harmony with the theme. Godet thinks that the fact that, according to the synoptists, our Lord in the garden <span class="accented">did</span> actually offer the prayer which he <span class="accented">here</span> hesitates to present, is evidence of the historic character of both accounts. I differ from him, because the sublime answer to the prayer here given would seem to preclude the necessity of the final conflict. The circumstance that he <span class="accented">did</span> offer the prayer as interpreted above, a prayer which was veritably heard, is in harmony with the narrative of the agony.

The second Adam knows the issue of the tremendous trial, and, in full apprehension of the answer to his deepest prayer, he cries, <span class="cmt_word">Father, glorify thy Name</span>. The "thy" is  emphatic. A contrast is implied between the eternal glory and the glory of the Christ. "I am thine; thou art mine;" "Thy will be done;" "Not as I will, but as thou wilt;" "If this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done;" "Not my will, but thine be done." I bare my breast for the blow; I yield my <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> absolutely to thy control! God glorifies himself in many ways, and here we see the highest point to which the human can rise. Godet calls attention to the extraordinary mistake made by Colani, who founds a charge against the Gospel itself on the supposition that these solemn words were, "Father, glorify <span class="accented">my</span> Name." The synoptists tell us that at the baptism (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and at the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>) a literal voice of words was heard from heaven conveying intelligible ideas to John the Baptist and subsequently to Peter, James, and John. And here the same John (son of Zebedee) records, not only that such a kind of voice was repeated on this occasion, but reports the very words themselves. <span class="cmt_word">There came therefore a voice out of heaven</span>, <span class="accented">saying<span class="cmt_word"></span>, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again</span>. These words many of the crowd round about him, as well as Jesus himself, distinctly heard. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude that stood by said, It has thundered</span>; hearing only a voice of thunder. It will not, however, on that account be fair to this evangelist to say (with Paulus, Lucke, and even Hengstenberg) that there was no objective audible voice which any ear beside that of Jesus could hear, and which none but the mind of Jesus could interpret. It is not sufficient to say "that the thunder and the voice were identical." Hengstenberg quotes numerous passages from the Old Testament where thunder was interpreted to mean the "voice of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>), but there are numerous passages both in the Old Testament and in the Gospels and Acts where an objective voice was heard. Such voice was at times accompanied by thunder, but not in the majority of cases. In the promises made in the garden of Eden, in the call of Moses and Samuel, and in the communion that passed between the Lord and Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, Solomon, and Elijah, Jehovah spake in audible words without such auxiliary. When communications were made to Eli, to David, to Hezekiah, and others, they were given by the lips of prophetic men. When the Law was given to all the tribes of Israel, the thunder-trumpet was exceeding loud and long, and the people could not bear the awful experience, so that the Lord was pleased to speak to Moses only, and <span class="accented">he</span> was to communicate with the people. The case of Elijah is remarkable because the "still small voice" is distinguished from the thunder, etc., which had preceded it. Why should Hengstenberg have refrained from giving these Old Testament facts their <span class="accented">proper</span> weight? The rationalistic view would make the words spoken to have been the inference that either Jesus or John drew from a clap of thunder, and must conclude that the crowd, so far as the objective fact was concerned, were practically in the right. The narrative itself recounts a varied appreciation of a distinct and objective fact. Those who were not alive to any voice from heaven confounded it with thunder, lowered the Divine communication down to an ordinary natural fact. <span class="cmt_word">Others</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a few others," were much nearer to the reality when they <span class="cmt_word">said, An angel hath spoken to him</span> (compare reference to the angelic aid that came to the Lord in Gethsemane). The voice of God's plenipotentiary angel speaking in his Name, was recognized as a supernatural communication, though the meaning of it was not grasped (cf. the voice with which Jesus spoke to Paul on the way to Damascus). But we may reasonably suppose that these Greeks, that the disciples who surrounded Jesus, that the beloved John, found in the voice a direct answer to the previous sublime cry of the Lord. The prayer, "Father, glorify thy Name," received the answer, <span class="cmt_word">I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> In thy work and life hitherto, as Prophet, Master, Example, as my beloved Son, my Name has already been glorified in thee, and now in thy approaching sacrificial agony in which thou wilt become perfect as a Priest-King, and the Author of eternal salvation, "I will glorify it again."

This surely establishes, on the authority of Jesus, the objective character of the revelation. "It was necessary that you should hear and know and feel who and what I am." Ever thinking of others, living in them, he thinks of their spiritual advantage now. Thoma says that whereas the whole scene corresponds with the synoptic account of Gethsemane, it is idealized on the basis of the Johannine idea of the Divine Lamb and the Logos in flesh, and that Jesus here shows that he needed no strengthening, as the objective revelation was entirely for the sake of others, and not for his own consolation. This ingenious criticism of Thoma rests on the unjustifiable hypothesis that the scene before us did <span class="accented">not</span> precede the agony of the garden, but was a bare invention of the evangelist, because the latter ruled that Gethsemane needed "idealization." Why should not the two scenes be equally true, revealing the fundamental identity of character and personality, the one, moreover, preparing for the other? (See notes on John 19.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - 5. <span class="accented">The judgment of this world</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Still more emphatically does Christ expound the heavenly voice, and vindicate for himself the most solemn position with reference to the world and its prince. The" world," or humanity evolving itself to the highest form of a complicated civilization, was present to him far more vividly than when the tempter showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. Instead of holding them in royal fee of the devil, and of compelling them to do his bidding, he declares that his hour, which had come, was an hour of judicial condemnation for the world. The corruption of the world, the radical injury done to human nature, starts out on its beautiful and decorated front like the leprosy did on the face of Naaman. <span class="cmt_word">Now is a judgment of the world</span>. Observe, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This is compatible with the statements of <a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17-19</a>, and not inconsistent with the frequent references in <a href="../../par/john/5.htm">John 5</a>. to the "last day." Because John gives prominence to the great principles of judgment, and implies that the books of remembrance and condemnation are written all over indelibly by the hand of the world itself, there is no proof that the Lord (in John) says nothing of the great catastrophic judgments of which the synoptic Gospels preserve the prophecy. Our Lord has rather revealed (according to John) the principles which make the judgment of the great day credible. What a man has become at any epoch of his existence, what a nation is about at any crisis of its history, whatsoever act represents the spirit of the whole world, is in each case the judgment which God, by his providence, passes upon him or it. Still more impressively with a second, <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">shall the prince of this world be cast out</span>. The phrase, "archon of this world," is a well-known later Hebraic phrase for "the ruler of the darkness of this world," the <span class="accented">shir-olam</span> of the rabbinical books, the angel of death, to whom was entrusted the rulership of the world outside of the sacred family. Christ declares that his own hour, in which the world and its prince would seem to be triumphant, would be the hour when he should be cast out of earth as he had been already cast out of heaven. This expulsion and destruction of the power and works of the devil was one great end assigned to the manifestation of the Son of God (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). It is important, however, to notice the difference of tenses. "Now is the judgment of this world," - this is the immediate result of his death; "Now <span class="accented">shall</span> the prince of this world be east out" describes the gradual victory of truth, which is pursued more explicitly in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a></div><div class="verse">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I, if I be lifted out of</span> (or, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the earth, will draw all</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">to myself. Now this he spake, signifying by what death he was about to die</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span> has been by Meyer, as well as many of the Fathers, referred to the Lord's resurrection and ascension. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> would certainly be in favor of it, and be a possible rendering if we hold (with Westcott and others) that resurrection and uplifting from the earth involve and presuppose a previous death, or that John always speaks of Christ's death as itself a glorious thing, as itself the commencement of the supreme glory of the Son of man. On the other hand - though this idea is reiterated by the opponents of the Fourth Gospel - there is nothing in the New Testament which makes the cross of Christ in itself a symbol of the exaltation of Jesus. Moreover, the next verse compels a closer reference to "the way in which he was about to die" - a mode of departure admirably expressed by the term "uplifting." The language of Jesus to Nicodemus, in which the same word occurs in describing the lifting up of the Son of man after the fashion in which the serpent was uplifted in the wilderness, confirms this interpretation of the evangelist, which we have no claim to traverse (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>). Christ declared that the attraction of the cross would be mightier than all the fascination of the prince of this world. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will draw," is applied elsewhere (<a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>) to the Father's work of grace, which preveniently prepares men to come to Christ. In these words we learn that the attraction of the cross of Christ will prove to be the mightiest and most sovereign motive ever brought to bear on the human will, and, when wielded by the Holy Spirit as a revelation of the matchless love of God, will involve the most sweeping judicial sentence that can be pronounced upon the world and its prince. In <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a> the belief or the conviction that the prince of this world has been already condemned (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is one of the great results of the mission of the Comforter.

The few Greeks, with Philip and Andrew, the other disciples, the smaller circle of sympathetic <span class="accented">listeners</span>, the disturbed and feverish crowd, are all about him, as he claims by death itself to judge the world, to win all men, and east out the spirit and prince of the world from his usurped throne. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude then</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered him, We heard</span> - received information by public teaching - <span class="cmt_word">out of the Law that the Christ abideth forever.</span> Numerous passages may have been reasonably in their minds - <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> - in which the glories of an everlasting kingdom were predicted. In ver. 23 the Lord had in their hearing spoken of himself as "Son of man." Meyer, by giving the dominant sense of glorification to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, thinks <span class="accented">that</span> the people must be contrasting, in pert criticism, the lowly "Son of man" before them with the "Son of man" of Daniel's vision. But it would be far more probable that the people accepted Christ's intimation of the manner of his death, and hence felt the incongruity of such a Son of man - One who dies, and therefore lives again - with the glowing pictures of Daniel or the 'Book of Henoch.' "The Christ abideth forever." <span class="cmt_word">And how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> They did not identify "the Son of man" with the Messiah.

It was once more a vague, dull inquiry, "Who art thou?" We are still in doubt who thou art, and how thou canst claim to be the Christ of our prophecies. To be our Christ, and die, is a contradiction in terms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.

The time for further instruction, or remonstrance, or declarations is at an end. The evangelist sums up, in vers. 44-50, the general substance of our Lord's teaching with reference to himself and his disciples and the world which would not believe; and thus, then, in a wonderful way, justifies, as it were, the non-answer to the captious question, "Who is this Son of man?" <span class="cmt_word">Yet a little while is the Light amongst you.</span> The "little while" of our Lord's day of ministry was often upon his lips (<a href="../../par/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16</a>). Verily to his consciousness it must have been but as the twinkling of an eye, and now it was a very little while even for his hearers. Based on this solemn fact, he makes a last public appeal to individuals, propounding gracious invitation, Divine promise, solemn warning; and so he terminated his public ministry, and vanished from before them. As far as the memory of his living words and deeds might influence them, the Light, though not among them, might still shine, and the glory of Pentecost would renew the appeal. <span class="cmt_word">Walk as ye have the Light</span>; make progress in the understanding of self, of duty, of time, of eternity, and act accordingly. The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> is the reading preferred to the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the T.R. in this and the following verse by Tischendorf, Meyer, Westport and Hort, and the Revisers' text. Meyer here differs from Godet and others who, accepting the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, give it, in virtue of certain passages in the classics, the sense of <span class="accented">quamdiu</span>, and justly maintains the sense "as," "in the measure that." According to the light that you see, <span class="cmt_word">walk, lest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, "in order that not") <span class="cmt_word">darkness overtake you: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth;</span> lest the possibility of seeing the Divine revelation in <span class="accented">me</span> be taken from you, and lest there be taken away from you that which you seem to have (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>). Then, in harmony with the great sayings of <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> and John 11:9, "In the night no man can work;" "In the night, when men cannot see the light of this world, they stumble over unseen perils and pitfalls;" so here, he says, in the darkness that will come upon men from making no use of the Light of the world, "they will not know whither they are going," they will find no work, have no perception of imminent danger, but, driven on and on by measureless force, they will drift over the fathomless unknown into infinite and endless suspense. When the Light of the world is spurned, and a godless evolution made to supply its place, humanity and the world have no goal set before them; there is no end at which they aim - no mind or will to guide the progress of mankind.

This utterance records the close of the Lord's public ministry, and therefore the solemn termination of the various scenes and discourses preserved in the synoptic narrative. The people of his love saw him no more till he appeared as a criminal in the hands' of the officers of the Sanhedrin, on his way to the Praetorium. In the silence of the home- at Bethany he probably spent the last day of his earthly ministry, which terminated in the marvelous converse at the Last Supper. "<span class="accented">This</span> time it was no mere cloud which obscured the sun, for to them the sun itself had <span class="accented">set</span>."

If "<span class="accented">so</span> many" <span class="accented">be</span> the correct reading, John is simply implying what he elsewhere expresses, that a widespread knowledge was possessed by him of groups of miraculous signs, of which he recorded only seven crucial symbolic specimens; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> wine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> bread; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> walking on the sea; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> healing nobleman's son; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> healing impotent man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> resurrection of Lazarus; to he followed by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> the healing of the ear of Malchns, and the resurrection of the Lord himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Signs in heaven, earth and sea;<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> startling miracles on human nature, and<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> on dead men, did not compel belief.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a></div><div class="verse">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In order that the words of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report?</span> or the message which the prophets have delivered - the prediction they made of a suffering and rejected Christ, of One who would "sprinkle many nations," and in the very "travail of his soul see his seed." <span class="cmt_word">To whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?</span> It does not mean that no hearts responded to the appeal, that the voice from heaven fell on no susceptible ears; but that it is one of the anomalies of human life that man does seem so insensible to his own highest interests. Prophets are always wondering at the condition of mankind. Even Jesus marveled at the unbelief of his hearers. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Isaiah shows that prophets foresaw the issue of the kind of reception that a people who had been so faithless to Jehovah's lesser manifestations would give to the most amazing of all his self-disclosures. The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> must not be explained away, the outline was presented by Isaiah of the reception which the favored but prejudiced and hardened house of Israel gave to Divine revelations. It would be filled in by the events which were then about to be enacted. God's intuition of actual facts, his unconditional foreknowledge of all contingent phenomena, do not necessitate their occurrence so as to deprive sinners of their guilt; yet when they have occurred, the causes which produced the widespread unbelief in the days of Isaiah were seen to be still at work, and to account for the strange incomprehensible mystery that blindness in part had happened to Israel. God works by law, and works freely by men and in them, not only foreseeing the evil and blindness, but positively punishing sin by blindness, taking away from a man that which he seemeth to have. By this means the "altar was built, the wood and the knife" for the great sacrifice. The use made of various portions of this oracle, by the Lord, by evangelists, by the apostles, by the deacon Philip, by Paul and Peter, shows that the early Church regarded it as the detailed description of the character suffering, and work of Christ. It became virtually a portion of the New Testament, and it was practically treated as such by Barnabas (100. 5, 'Ep. to Diog.,' 100. 49) and Justin Martyr (1 'Apol.,' 100. 50). The fifty-third of Isaiah may have been imperfectly understood by its author, may in his mind have had this, that, or the other original reference, and have suffered various Judaic interpretations. Modern criticism may scoff at it as a Messianic prophecy. All this does not touch the patent fact that nearly all the writers of the New Testament and numerous classes in the early Church used it as descriptive of their idea of Christ's work. It thus becomes of priceless value.

This same solemn passage is quoted in four other places in the New Testament. Perhaps <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a> is hardly to be regarded as a citation; a small portion only of the passage is introduced from the prophet without reference to him, and this is inverted in order. In <a href="../../par/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a> there is the nearer approach to the LXX., which, however, transforms the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e2;</span>, "to hear, hear ye," into <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "by hearing ye shall hear;" and similarly with the other clauses, - the imperative of God's command to the prophet being resolved into the future of most certain accomplishment, and in place of "Lest they understand with their heart, and convert, and he [God] heal them," LXX. reads, "Lest... should convert, and I [who give you the command to deliver such a message, notwithstanding its results upon them] heal them." This St. Matthew has followed. <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> has given a different representation again, and, while omitting a considerable portion of the passage, passes to the climax, which is put thus: "Lest they should be converted, and their sin should be forgiven them," showing that the evangelist, looking to the Hebrew rather than to the LXX., has resolved its meaning into a clearly related paraphrase. In <a href="../../par/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26, 27</a> the passage almost verbally follows the LXX. Here in the remarks of St. John the whole passage seems independent of the LXX., and to have resolved the Hebrew "imperative," addressed to the prophet, into an awful assurance of Divine agency in the matter. Instead of "shut their eyes," Hebrew imperative, or LXX. "their eyes they closed," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., he says, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">He hath blinded their eyes</span>; and so with the other terms: <span class="cmt_word">He hardened</span> <span class="cmt_word">their heart; in order that they should not</span> (lest they should) <span class="cmt_word">see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and should turn, and I should heal them.</span> In <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> the evangelist, returning to the first person, draws a distinction between the retributive activity of the pre-existent Christ of the earlier revelation and the historical Savior. There is no slip or negligence. Godet and Hengstenberg go a long way in making God the Author of the sin and rejection, and the cause of the impossibility of their repentance and healing. That which in all the several quotations of this passage we learn from Isaiah's oracle is that the unforced and willful rejection of the Divine Word is visited by condign withdrawment of the faculty to receive even more accessible and apprehensible truth. This is the great law of Divine operation in the nature of all moral beings. This law is described as a distinctly foreseen event, and by LXX. as an apprehensible and even conspicuous fact, and it is quoted by St. John as the direct consequence of the Divine activity. He does not mean to say that, because Isaiah foretold this as a Divine reprobation, they, whether they would or not as individuals, were fated to die the death of blindness, but they could not believe, because, on the principle involved in Isaiah's predictions, the Divine government had fulfilled itself, had acted upon its universal law, and in consequence of vows and acts of willful disobedience, they had thus fallen into the curse that belongs to a neglect of the Divine. "They could not believe." Thus even now disinclination to God and to righteousness leads to moral incapacity. Sin is punished by its natural consequences: unbelief is punished by unsusceptibility to clearest evidence; prejudice by blindness; rejection of Divine love by inability to see it at its best. How is this natural evolution brought about? Surely by laws of God. What are these laws but God's ways of acting with all moral agents whatever?

These words are used, not to mitigate the charge, but to show that, though individuals did believe, even among the rulers, they had not courage to avow their faith. The instances of Nicodemus and Joseph and others lie upon the surface. Godet thinks rather of Gamaliel and the like, "the Eras-muses of those days." Theirs was, indeed, an hypocrisy of unbelief, and it is not 'altogether banished from the modern world, and notwithstanding Christ's rejection by the nation as a nation, individuals saw his glory and believed. It is still true of municipalities, nations, even Churches, that they reject Christ, while individuals among them are molded by and obedient to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">But by reason of the Pharisees</span> - our Lord's most deadly enemies, from <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. to <a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. - <span class="cmt_word">they were making no confession</span> - or, <span class="accented">acknowledgment -</span> of his claims, <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be put out of the synagogue</span>; become the excommunicate, fall under the terrible ban (see <a href="../../par/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).

Because the prophet saw the glory of Christ, the unutterable majesty of the "Word of God," he delivered, as we know, this tremendous burden. Few utterances of the New Testament convey in more startling form the conviction of the apostles touching the pre-existence of the Lord, and the identification of the Divine Personality of the Christ, with the highest conception that the Hebrew prophet entertained of the Almighty One, of the eternal Godhead.

Moulton suggests that the glory here thought of by the apostle was the "glory" of ver. 41 - the glory of the union of the Redeemer with his people, the glory of suffering and death. The reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. appears to be the true solution. The glory of God himself in his awful holiness was of less interest than the glory of the Sanhedrin and the approval of the world. Alas! this glory is nearer, more obvious and has more to do with tangible, sensuous, advantages, than the Divine approval. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-50.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The <span class="accented">summation of the supreme conflict between our Lord and the world</span>. The portion of the chapter which follows is regarded by most commentators, Lucke, Meyer, Godet, Olshausen, and Westcott, as a summary of our Lord's teaching, as a reiteration by the evangelist of those salient points of the Lord's ministry which, while they are the life of the world, are nevertheless the grounds on which blinded eyes and hardened hearts rejected him. Vers. 44-46 characterize the believer; vers. 47, 48 emphasize Christ's relation to the unbeliever; vers. 49, 50 the principle upon which both deliverances turn and will continue to turn. There are those who think that these were special private addresses to the disciples, uttered after our Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) was hidden, but the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>) "cried aloud," would not then have been used, as it was used for the most public expressions of his doctrine, when given once for all (here comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>, with <a href="../../par/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>). Keim, De Wette, Baur, and Hilgenfeld think that, because there is no fresh departure here, it is proof that <span class="accented">all</span> the discourses of Christ in John are similarly put together with no historical basis. But if it be so, this differs strangely from all the rest of our Lord's discourses recorded by John in that it has no occasion, or persons, or opportunity to which it seems to fit. Certain aorists suggest the idea that John has here given specimens of our Lord's appeals which had ended in his being rejected by the nation as a whole. Luthardt takes the view of these words being spoken <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> on our Lord's departure, and with him Hengstenberg also agrees. These critics suppose that they form the closing words of our Lord's public ministry, delayed by the intercalary remarks of the evangelist, and really belong to the close of the thirty-sixth verse. Though the expressions flint follow are built upon the discourses elsewhere uttered, we admit, with Hengstenberg, that there is no verbal parallel that is at all close, and that therefore the evangelist must not be quoting from what he had already reported, but giving the substance of a threefold class of observations found from one end of the Gospel to the other, and in words that he had heard the Master use. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44, 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,PGBR> <span class="cmt_word">but on him that sent me; and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me</span>. These words do not occur before, but in every form our Lord had exalted "him that sent him." His doctrine or teaching, his purpose in manifestation, the secret food that sustained him, the Divine presence that never left him alone, the entire background of the mission of his human will and life into the world, the object of faith to men as revealed in his humanity, and that which the spiritual eye ought to see, nay - if the beholder did but know it does see, constitute an unveiling of the eternal Father who sent him into the world (see <a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 9, 24</a>). It becomes, then, of high value to grasp the truth. We actually believe in God when believing in him. His mission is lost in the glory of God who appears in him. So far as he is <span class="accented">sent</span>, he was necessarily of lower order and rank than he who sent him. His humanity began to be in time; it was generated in the womb of the Virgin; it was sanctified and sent into the world; and yet through it there was the highest revelation of the Father. We cannot attribute so stupendous a thought to the evangelist, and at the same time we admit the portentous singularity and uniqueness of the consciousness which could thus aver identity of nature with God and the completeness of revelation that the Speaker was making in himself of the Father.

The evangelist had said, in his prologue, "In him was life," and the Life (the eternal Logos of life) was "the Light of men." All true understanding, all purifying, gracious influence shed on human affairs, nature, or destiny, are the issue and result of the Divine Life which, under every dispensation, has wrought in humanity. Above all, "the Light that lighteth every man," namely, that which has always and which ever will radiate from the life conferred on our humanity by the Logos, the life of God in mind and conscience, "came into the world"  - came, that is, in a new and more effective form, came in the radiance of a perfect human life. The evangelist has sustained his teaching by quoting the solemn words of Jesus in <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a>, where a special narrative of miraculous love typified both the need in which the human family, the sacred Israel, and even his own disciples, stood of light, and of the light which he could pour upon the sightless eyeballs. And now the connection of this passage is - You could not behold me if light did not stream forth from me. <span class="cmt_word">I have come</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">am come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, this has been and is my abiding purpose; cf. <a href="../../par/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>) <span class="cmt_word">a Light into the world, and</span> my object has been and is that <span class="cmt_word">whosoever believeth on me</span> - whoso-ever sees by the inward eye that which I really am, sees how my life stands related to the Father, whosoever assents to the new revelation thus given, even over and above the "<span class="accented">inward</span> light" of the Logos - <span class="cmt_word">should not abide in the darkness</span> which enwraps all souls; for, as said in the prologue, "<span class="accented">the</span> Light" (the archetypal Light) shineth upon the darkness of human nature, and the darkness comprehendeth it not." It should be especially noticed that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> St. Paul had grasped and uttered the fullness of this thought.

The "hearing" is clearly not identical with spiritual acceptance, but is restricted to the awful charge of responsibility that comes upon every man who simply hears, knows what Christ's words are, and then "<span class="accented">keeps"</span> them not so as to fulfill their intention. Christ says, I judge him not. I am not <span class="accented">now</span> pronouncing a sentence upon him; I am his Savior; but this is his condemnation, that he believes not, etc. (<a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17-19</a>). Our Lord claimed, in the sermon on the mount, to be the Executor of a judgment, and in <a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-29</a> he declared that he would be as Son of man, the final Adjudicator of doom on the disobedient (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>.), and in many places he made this thought even more solemn by speaking of himself on that occasion, not as the compassionate Savior, but the Administrator of an inviolable law, which cannot be swayed by immediate emotion, but will effectuate itself on eternal and unswerving principles. The Law accuses the old Law (<a href="../../par/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">but I judge him not; for I came</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">not to judge, but to save the world,</span> referring to the Incarnation in its purport and supreme motive.

How strange that some critics should, with a view to disparage the authenticity of the Gospel, make it appear that there is no reference in it to judgment to come, or to the last day, and should deliberately ignore this feature of the Johannine Gospel! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a></div><div class="verse">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - There is much emphasis to be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which implies that our Lord would give a sacred reason for the tremendous power with which his <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would be invested. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, is not simply his; it did not proceed from himself only, from his humanity, or even his Divine Sonship alone, but from <span class="cmt_word">the Father which sent me</span>. He stood and spake always as the Voice of the Eternal One, from whom he came, with saving powers. <span class="cmt_word">He has given me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak</span>. The two words <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<span class="accented">dicam</span> and <span class="accented">loquar</span>, Vulgate), though Hengstenberg says it is frivolous to distinguish, are supposed by Meyer, Westcott, and Godet, to discriminate matter and form, as Godet says, "What I should say, and how I should say <span class="accented">it</span>." My words and their manner and opportunity and tone are all of them the outcome of the Father's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>. It certainly is incredible that John could have put these words into the lips of Jesus. They are no mere summary. They are set down with awful sincerity as having burned themselves into his memory. But the Lord added, "I may be rejected and my words spurned, and yet they may go on as apparitors of judgment, but however that may be, and <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that his commandment,</span> his commission to me<span class="cmt_word">, is life eternal</span> - is so now" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12, 13</a>). "The Law is ordained unto life," said Paul, and "the goodness of God leadeth us unto repentance." The depth of this sublime experience goes down and back into the eternal counsels. <span class="cmt_word">The things which therefore I speak</span> (am speaking even at this moment), <span class="cmt_word">even as the Father has said unto me, so I speak</span>. "In rejecting me and my words, men reject and insult the Father. His word they dare to renounce, as solemn and unalterable as the word spoken on Sinai. They not only reject me, but they count themselves unworthy of eternal life. They not only spurn Law, but love." Thus, at the conclusion of the public ministry, the evangelist sets forth, in a few burning words, the theme of the prologue, so far as it is realized in the offer of a full revelation of the Logos to the world in human flesh. This Logos found adequate utterance through the human life and lips of Jesus. "The Father has been so amply revealed that the non-believer and rejecter, who hears and does not keep my sayings, is disbelieving and rejecting Hill." These potent words, and this wonderful conclusion of the entire record of the public ministry of Jesus, is the appropriate summary of teachings which were now brought to a dose. Without any exact parallels, they breathe the spirit of the whole teaching, they supply the basis of the prologue. It is, however, dear that the style is different from the prologue, and from the reflection of the evangelist in previous verses. Just as the whole Gospel is a series of recollections which form from their own intrinsic glory and truth a sacred inimitable whole, so this <span class="accented">spicilegium</span> is a brief <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio - a</span> gathering up of the whole in the narrow compass of a few precious lines. Though "the hour" has come, it waits. The comparison between this method of the evangelist and that of the apocalyptist is very impressive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
