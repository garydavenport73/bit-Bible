The fertility of the Jewish race in modern times has been a frequent subject of observation, and supplies the best comment upon Jeremiah s prophecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will set up shepherds</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> rulers, not necessarily kings (see on next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Which shall feed them</span>. For the evil shepherds "fed themselves, and fed not my flock" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall fear no more.</span> Ezekiel again contributes an essential feature to the description. The neglect of the shepherds left the flock exposed to the ravages of wild beasts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they be lacking</span>. A speaking phrase. Too many of the sheep had fallen down precipices or been carried off by lions. Yet the context rather favors a slight and palaeographically natural emendation of Hitzig, "Neither shall they be terrified." The Septuagint omits the word altogether, which favors the supposition that they read as Hitzig would read, for they are apt to condense by omitting synonyms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - (Comp. the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come</span>. The use of the analogous phrase, "And it shall come to pass in that day," would lead us to suppose that this verse describes a fresh stage in the progress of events, as if the faithful shepherds (ver. 4) were to precede the "righteous Branch" (ver. 5). Such a view, however, is not very plausible, for the Messtab, according to prophecy, is to appear in the darkest of times. The prophet simply means to impress upon us the greatness of the revelation which he is about to communicate. <span class="cmt_word">I will raise unto David</span>. The promised Messiah, then, is certainly to be of the family of David (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A righteous Branch</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a righteous Plant</span>: the root means "to bud, or sprout." This is the first time in which the title the Plant is unmistakably applied to the Messianic King (possibly, but <span class="accented">less</span> probably, to the Messianic kings). It indicates that this great personage stands in connection with the divinely ordained and ancient royal family, but that he is in some way unique, and far surpasses his human ancestors. He "springs forth;" therefore he is not a sort of meteoric appearance, without any natural home among men, but rather the blossom of the Jewish nation, the embodiment of its highest qualities. And yet there is something extraordinary about him, for it is needful that Jehovah himself should "raise" this Plant from the almost worn-out stock of David. Note that the word rendered here in the Authorized Version "Branch" is not the same as that in the parallel passage in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). It is, however, the word employed in <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>, which is taken by many, especially the elder interpreters (but with very doubtful justice), to be a prophecy of the Messiah. It is also the word used by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>), as a <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Messiah, which is one strong reason for rejecting the view mentioned above that the word rendered "the Branch," or "the Plant," is to be taken collectively as equivalent to "branches," or rather "plants" (the article is not expressed in the Hebrew). In short, this passage and the prophecies referred to in Jeremiah are exceptions to the general Old Testament usage of the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">cemakh</span>), which is elsewhere a collective term equivalent to "plantation." It is true that in ver. 4 "shepherds," in the plural, are spoken of, but there is no reason why this title should be confined to kings - it may as fairly be <span class="accented">extended</span> to the chief rulers under a king as the term "king" itself (see on Jeremiah 17:20); and true, further, that ill <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a> a continuous succession is promised of Davidic heirs to the throne, but this is not decisive in favor of the collective meaning, any more than Isaiah's later prophecy that "the [reigning Davidic] king shall reign in righteousness" disproves the strictly Messianic reference of his earlier promise in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. All prophecy is conditional; there may have been moral reasons why a continuance of the Davidic dynasty was held out by Jeremiah at one time as a possible prospect. (It is, however, extremely probable that <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a> is the work of some other inspired writer; see <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.) The thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, which is so closely parallel to this section, appears to interpret the prophecy of a single Messianic king (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And a King shall reign</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he shall reign as king</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be the realized ideal of an Israelitish king - a second David. <span class="cmt_word">And prosper</span>; or, <span class="accented">and deal wisely</span>. There is the same doubt as to the rendering of the verb in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a> a. The radical idea is that of wisdom, and the analogy of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> favors the alternative rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Shall execute judgment</span>; in contrast to the neglectful conduct of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall dwell safely</span>. In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) we read "Jerusalem," and there can hardly be a doubt that "Jerusalem" ought to be restored here. This is not the-only instance in which, by mistake, the scribe has written "Israel" instead of "Jerusalem" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-49.htm">Jeremiah 51:49</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>). In <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a> the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word, "Jerusalem," after the wrong one, "Israel," but without canceling the latter (Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' 1880, pp. 97-101). <span class="cmt_word">And this is his name whereby he shall be called</span>. There is a various reading, which may be rendered either, <span class="accented">whereby they shall call</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>, or her), or, <span class="accented">which they shall proclaim</span>, supported by the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and a few manuscripts (St. Jerome, too, mentions this reading). There is also a more important difference among the commentators as to the person who was to bear the name. The older Christian interpreters contended with all their might for the view that the name belonged to the Messiah, partly on real philological grounds, partly with the illegitimate theological object of obtaining a proof-text for the orthodox doctrine of the person of the Messiah and (in the case of Protestant writers) of justification. It is much to the credit of Hengstenberg that he sets this object aside, and while maintaining the Messianic reference of the pronoun interprets the name with a single eye to the requirements of the context, "He by whom and under whom Jehovah will be our righteousness." The objection is that in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) Jeremiah assigns the name "Jehovah-Tsidkenu," not to the Messiah, but to Jerusalem. The prophet must be allowed to be his best interpreter, so that we must, it would seem, at any rate, reject the Messianic reference. But then how are we to explain the pronoun? It is right to refer the parallel pronoun in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> to "Jerusalem," because the pronoun there is feminine, and evidently refers to a city, but it is not natural in our passage to explain "his name" of "Israel," seeing that the subject of the noun in the parallel line is, not Israel, but the Messiah. is the text here correct? A comparison of the parallel psalms Psalms 14 and Psalms 53, and of the corresponding chapters in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, will show how easily errors made their way into duplicate copies of the same passage. Granting that we have such duplicate copies of this prophecy in Jeremiah, there can be no doubt which is the more original; the form of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> has a difficulty from which <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> is free - a difficulty of interpretation and a difficulty also of grammar. For, as Ewald has already pointed out ('Hebrew Grammar,' &sect; 249 b), the contracted suffix is very rarely attached to the simple imperfect, and the clear style in which this section is written justifies us in regarding any unusual form with suspicion. "Israel" thus was probably written by mistake for "Jerusalem," and this error soon led to others - first, the omission of "her," and then the prefixing of "his name" for clearness, and (on the part of the authors of the points) the mispointing of the verb (so as to include in the form the pronoun "him"). It is some confirmation of this view that there are several other passages in which the words "Israel" and "Jerusalem" appear to have been confounded (see preceding note). Read, therefore, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, And this is <span class="accented">the name wherewith she shall be called</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">Yahveh</span> (Jehovah) <span class="accented">Tsidkenu</span>. The name is formed on the analogy of other symbolic names, such as El-elohe-Israel (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>), Jehovah-Nisei (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a> ), and especially Jehovah-Shammah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>), also a name of Jerusalem. These names are, in fact, sentences; Jehovah-Shammah, for instance, means "The Lord (is) there;" and the name in the present verse, "The Lord (is) our Righteousness" (Hengstenberg's view mentioned above seems less natural). It is singular that Zedekiah's name should come so near to that announced by the prophet. But there is still a difference between them. Zedekiah must mean "The Lord (is) righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is ever faithful to his revealed principles of action. But Jehovah-Tsidkenu may be correctly paraphrased, "The Lord is the author of our <span class="accented">prosperity</span>," or, more strictly, "of the justification of our claims in the sight of our enemies" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1, 2</a>). Similar applications of forensic language are familiar, e.g. "When they speak with their enemies in the gate" (<a href="../../par/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>).

Either the Septuagint translator or the copyist of the Hebrew manuscript which he used appears to have thought that the passage might, therefore, be dispensed with. In the Septuagint it is placed at the end of the chapter (being possibly supplied from another Hebrew manuscript), and the form given in this version to the close of ver. 6 (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, combining the opening words of ver. 9) shows that ver. 9 followed immediately upon ver. 6 in the Hebrew manuscript.

But it is not probable that two entirely different causes should be given for the prophet's deep emotion (see the latter part of the verse). Besides, "breaking of the heart" is nowhere a sign of anger (as Authorized Version would suggest), but either of grief (see on Jeremiah 8:20, or, as the context implies here, physical disturbance at the solemn message of Jehovah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All my bones shake</span>.

This verse is connected with ver. 16; it gives the reason why the false prophets were not to be listened to. None of them had been admitted to the secret council of the Lord; the interrogation is here a form of denial. "To stand in the council" is not the same as "to sit" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>); the latter phrase implies taking an active part in the consultations. It is specially applicable to the true prophets, according to ver. 22, and this, as we gather from other passages, m a twofold sense. Sometimes the prophets had visions, in which their inner eye was granted a sight of Jehovah in consultation with his trusted servants (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, comp. 8; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>); and the words of Eliphaz, "Weft thou listening in the council of God?" (<a href="../../par/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>), appear to be descriptive of a similar experience. But the phrase may also be used in a wider sense of entirely unecstatic revelations. Amos says (<a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), "Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret counsel unto his servants the prophets; ' and a psalmist extends the term "secret counsel" to the communion which God grants to the pious in general (<a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>). Thus there is no hard and-fast line between the experiences of the prophets and those of humbler believers. In so far as the latter are "disciples of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>), they too may be truly said to "stand," at least in the doorway, "in the council of Jehovah;" just as a well-known collect inherited from the Latin Church beseeches that "by God's holy inspiration we may think those things that he good." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath marked his word</span>? A Jewish tradition, represented by the marginal notes in the Hebrew Bible, has taken offence at this variation in the expression, and would correct the reading to "my word." But such changes of person are of frequent occurrence, and we know that the prophets were thoroughly assured that the word which they spoke was not theirs, but that of him who sent them.

The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence "shall not return"). The form of the verse reminds us of <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the latter days</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in future days</span>, as Dr. Henderson rightly renders. It seems better to restrict the term "latter days" to the Messianic period ("the coming age," <a href="../../par/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). The phrase in itself simply means "in the sequel of the days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30, 30</a>:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (<span class="accented">aria akhrat yumi irib</span>, "For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall consider it</span>, etc., or rather, <span class="accented">ye shall understand it clearly</span>, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins.

Jeremiah mentions it as one of the marks of a false prophet that he appealed to his dreams (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>); true prophecy contented itself with less ambiguous media of communication with the unseen world. It may be objected that Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), at any rate, and Abimelech (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) received Divine revelations in dreams; but these were not officially prophets. Nathan and the contemporaries of the author of Job had messages from God by night, but these are called, not dreams, but visions (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, comp. 17; <a href="../../par/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). Deuteronomy (and this is one of its striking points of agreement with Jeremiah) expressly describes a false prophet as "a dreamer of dreams" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). Two passages in the Old Testament seem inconsistent with this discouragement of dreams as a medium of revelation - <a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, where the Lord is said to make himself known to prophets by visions and dreams, and <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where the prophetic dreams of the old men are one of the features of a Messianic description; but it is noteworthy that the first of these refers to the primitive period of Israel's history, and the second to the distant Messianic age. In its classical period prophecy kept itself sedulously aloof from a field on which it had such compromising companionship (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>).

But this rendering leaves out of account a second interrogative which in the Hebrew follows "how long." It is better to translate this difficult passage, with De Dieu and many moderns, thus: "How long (<span class="accented">quousque durabit haec ipsorum impudentia</span>)<span class="accented">?</span> Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and the prophets of the deceit of their own heart; are they thinking (I say) to cause my people to forget," etc.?

Jeremiah, then, does not deny that there is a measure of truth in what these prophets say; he only demands a distinct declaration that their dreams are but dreams, and not equal in authority to the Divine word. For, as he continues, <span class="cmt_word">What is the chaff to the wheat</span>? What right have you to mix the worthless chaff with the pure, winnowed grain? How, he implies, can such an adulterated message produce the designed effect of a prophetic revelation? (St. Paul has a somewhat similar figure, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-13</a>.) So Naegelsbach. Keil, however, denies that there is any thought of an adulteration of the Divine word by the "false prophets." According to him, the question in this verse is simply meant to emphasize the contrast between the false, dream-born prophecy of Jeremiah's opponents and the true revelations. How can the false prophecy pretend to be the true? They are as different as chaff and wheat. Both views are admissible. Naegelsbach introduces a new element by suggesting the intermixture of false and true in the utterances of the "false prophets;" but his view is not inconsistent with what the prophet has stated before, and it is favored by ver. 30 and by the command, <span class="cmt_word">Let him speak my word faithfully</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in its genuine form; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>, "A faithful or trustworthy [i.e. a genuine] seed;" also, for the general sense, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>.

As in vers. 19, 20, so here, the prophet contrasts the message of the false prophets with that of the true. The former flatter their hearers with promises of peace; the latter speak a stern but potent word, which burns like a fire, and crushes like a hammer. Observe, the prophet does not define the activity of the fire as he does that of the hammer; for the fire has a twofold effect - protection to God's friends and destruction to his enemies. On the figure of the hammer, comp. Jeremiah 1:23; 51:20.

First we are told that the prophets <span class="cmt_word">steal my words every one from his neighbor</span>. The latter part of the phrase reminds us of ver. 27, but the neighbor in this case must mean, at any rate primarily, a fellow-prophet, one who has really received a revelation at first-hand from Jehovah. The "false prophets," not trusting to their "dreams" alone, listen greedily to the discourses of men like Jeremiah, not with a view to spiritual profit, but to making their own utterances more effective. We must remember that they lived by their prophesying (<a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>).

But the word <span class="accented">massa</span> was also in common use for "load, burden," and hence the "false prophets" applied the term derisively to Jeremiah's discourses. "Rightly does he call his word a <span class="accented">massa</span>; it is not merely a solemn utterance, but a heavy burden; as De Wette puts it, not merely a <span class="accented">Weissagung</span>, but a <span class="accented">Wehsagung</span>. The passage is important as indicating the sense in which the true prophets understood the term. It should be added that the term mused is prefixed to at least four Biblical passages which, not being of threatening import, do not admit of being entitled "burdens" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>).

This involves a slight difference in the pronunciation of the text from that adopted by the Massoretes, but is adopted by the Septuagint, Peshito, Vulgate, a few manuscripts, and most critics; it is, in fact, almost required by the figure which fills the verse. <span class="cmt_word">And cast you out of my presence</span>. "And cast you" is not in the Hebrew; nor is it necessary to supply the words, if the preceding clauses be rightly translated.
