"Girdle" is one of the meanings of the Hebrew ('<span class="accented">ezor</span>), but is here unsuitable. As Ver. 11 shows, it is an inner garment that is meant, one that "cleaveth to the loins of a man" (in fact, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Septuagint, the <span class="accented">lumbare</span> of the Vulgate). The corresponding Arabic word, '<span class="accented">izar</span>, has, according to Lane, the meaning of "waist-wrapper.' Israel was to Jehovah in as close a relation spiritually as that in which the inner garment referred to is to him who wears it materially. There is an Arabic proverb which well illustrates this: "He is to me in place of an '<span class="accented">izar"</span> (Freytag, 'Studium der Arab. Spraohe,' p. 298). "A linen apron" may perhaps be specified, because linen was the material of the priestly dress (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and Israel was to be spiritually" a kingdom of priests." But this is not absolutely necessary. The common man used linen in his dress as well as the priest; the only difference between them was that the priest was confined to linen garments. But an ,' apron" would in any case naturally be made of linen. <span class="cmt_word">Linen</span>; literally, flax (a product of Judah, <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Put it not in water</span>. The object of the prohibition is well stated by St. Jerome. It was at once to symbolize the character of the people of Israel, stiff and impure, like unwashed linen, and to suggest the fate in store for it (Ver. 9).

A long interval elapses, and he is commanded to make a second journey to the same place, and fetch away the apron. What does this <span class="accented">P'rath</span> mean? It is by no means easy to decide. Hardly "the Euphrates," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the common prefix, "the river," is wanting, though in so extraordinary a narrative it was peculiarly needed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because of the length of the journey to Babylonia, which has ex hyp. to be made twice; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the Euphrates is not a rocky river. Ewald suggested that "some wet place near Jerusalem" probably had the name of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, and indicates a valley and spring called Forah, about six English miles north-east of Jerusalem. Mr. Birch appears to have hit independently on the same spot, which he identifies with the Parah of <a href="../../par/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>, about three miles north-east of Anatbeth, and describes as a picturesque gorge between savage rocks, with a copious stream (<span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, October, 1880, p. 236). This combination, however, involves an emendation of the text (<span class="accented">P'rath</span> into <span class="accented">Parah</span>) <span class="accented">- logically</span> it involves this, as Mr. Birch has seen; Ewald's comparison of the Arabic <span class="accented">furat</span>, sweet water, seems inconsistent with his reference to Parah - for which there does not seem to be sufficient necessity; and it is better to adopt the view of the great old French Protestant scholar, Bochart, that <span class="accented">P'rath</span> is a shortened form of Ephrath, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at once Bethlehem and the district in which Bethlehem lay (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>). It need hardly be said that the limestone hills of this region afforded abundance of secluded rocks. There may, of course, be at the same time an allusion to the ordinary meaning of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, viz. Euphrates, on the analogy of the allusion in <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>. Those who hold the view here rejected, that <span class="accented">P'rath is</span> equivalent to the Euphrates, sometimes suppose that the narrative is a parable or symbolical fiction, such as Luther, Calvin, and others find in <a href="../../par/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 3</a>, the thing signified being in this case the carrying captive of the people to Babylon; and this seems the best way of making this interpretation plausible.

Could there be a greater humiliation for Judah and Jerusalem than to be compared to a rotting linen apron? The hard things said of <span class="cmt_word">this evil people</span> in Ver. 10 must of course be understood with the limitations indicated in the note on Jeremiah 9:15, 16. Imagination should (as usual) be <span class="accented">stubbornness</span>. The explanation in Ver. 11 is a strong argument for the rendering "apron" (see above, on Ver. 1).

The first symbol referred to the people as a whole; the second represents the fate of the individual members of the people. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the lord God of Israel</span>, are omitted in the Septuagint, and certainly the form of the following phrase seems hardly worthy of so solemn an introduction. <span class="cmt_word">Every bottle</span>. It is an earthenware bottle, or pitcher, which seems from Ver. 13 to be meant (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>), though the Septuagint renders here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The kings that sit upon David's throne</span>; rather, that <span class="accented">sit for David upon his throne</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as David's heirs and successors.

For the fulfillment, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. After a reign of three months, the young prince and his mother were carried to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">And to the queen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and to the queen-mother</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the mistress</span>). It will be noticed that, except in two cases, the names of the mothers of the reigning kings of Judah are scrupulously mentioned in the Books of Kings. This and the title of "mistress" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as "mistress," or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>.). From an historical point of view, the "queen-mother" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.). It should be added, however, that once (viz. <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-19.htm">1 Kings 11:19</a>) the same title, "mistress," is applied to the queen-consort. <span class="cmt_word">Humble yourselves, sit down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sit down in abase</span>-sent; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take the station suitable for your abased circumstances (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your principalities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your</span> <span class="accented">head</span>. <span class="accented">ornaments</span>.

The tense, however, in the Hebrew, is the perfect - viz. that of prophetic certitude.
