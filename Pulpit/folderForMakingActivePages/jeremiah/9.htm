A quaint conceit, it may be said. But "if we have been going on pace for pace with the passion before, this sudden conversion of a strong-felt metaphor into something to be actually realized in nature, is strictly and strikingly natural." So Bishop Dearie, quoting, by way of illustration, Shakespeare's 'Richard II.,' "meditating on his own utter annihilation as to royalty:" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Oh that I were a mockery king of snow,<br />To melt before the sun of Bolingbroke!"</span> The tone of complaint continues in the following verse, though the subject is different.

Comp., besides the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6, 7</a>, our own Cowper's fine reminiscence of Jeremiah: "Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness!" <span class="accented">etc</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Adulterers... treacherous men</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-11.htm">Jeremiah 5:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they bend their tongues <i>like</i> their bow <i>for</i> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they bend their tongues</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and they bend their tongue as their bow of falsehood</span>, <span class="accented">and they use not their valor in</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to</span>) <span class="accented">good faith</span>. There is a sad, stern irony in these words, which remind us of Isaiah's (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>) "valiant men - for drinking wine" and of our own prophet's repetition of himself in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>, "Their valor is - untruth." A less pointed form of the same figurative statement is that of the psalmist in <a href="../../par/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the land</span>. The Authorized Version pays very little regard to the context in its rendering of the ambiguous word <span class="accented">erec</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take ye heed every one of his neighbor</span>. Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were "the salt" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">Every brother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. <span class="cmt_word">Will utterly supplant</span>. There is nothing in the context to suggest an allusion to <a href="../../par/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> (Jacob). The verb has its common sense of deceiving. The tense should be the present, not the future, both here and in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Will walk</span>; rather, <span class="accented">goeth about</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, <i>and</i> weary themselves to commit iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have taught their tongue</span>, etc.; again an intimation of the unnaturalness (in the higher sense) of vice (comp. on Jeremiah 2:33). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-6.htm">Jeremiah 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">Thine habitation <i>is</i> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine habitation</span>, etc. According to St. Jerome, this is addressed to the prophet; but it is better to follow the Targum, which makes the clause refer to the Jewish people. The connection is (as Dr. Payne Smith points out)," Trust no one; for thou dwellest surrounded by deceit on every side." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will melt them.</span> It is the same word as that used in <a href="../../par/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a> of the "refiner and purifier of silver." Purification, not destruction, is the object of the judgment which is threatened! Strange that mercy should find place, after the offence of the criminal has been found so grievous l But, lest we should expect too favorable an issue, the prophet adds, in the name of Jehovah, <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I do</span>? or rather, <span class="accented">How should I act? How otherwise should I act?</span> The continuation is a little doubtful. The Hebrew has," by reason of the daughter of my people;" but this can hardly be right. We naturally expect something to justify the preceding statement. The reading of the Septuagint answers to our anticipations by rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and this is confirmed by the parallel passage <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-32.htm">Jeremiah 32:32</a>).

To give an idea of the greatness of the impending blow, all the skilled mourners are sent for to raise the cry of lamentation. But no, this is not enough. So large will be the number of the dead that all the women must take their part in the doleful office. The description of the mourning women is as true to modern as to ancient life in the East. "And, indeed," says Dr. Shaw, a thoughtful traveler and an ornament of Oxford in the dark eighteenth century, "they perform their parts with such proper sounds, gestures, and commotions, that they rarely fail to work up the assembly into some extraordinary pitch of thoughtfulness and sorrow" ('Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 242; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>).

Streets, in the parallel clause, means the "broad places" where men congregate to toll the news.

With other points, the word rendered "speak" would mean "pestilence." Possibly the word fell out of Ver. 21, where it would find an excellent place in the second clause (as an explanatory parallel to "death," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>), which would thus obtain greater roundness and symmetry. <span class="cmt_word">As the handful</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as thickly as one heap of corn succeeds another under the deft hand of the leaper.

Perhaps a comparison of <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17, 18</a>, may help us. There the prophet looks forward to a complete desolation resulting from the Chaldean invasion, and yet declares that he can even exult in his God. So here. All subjects of boasting have been proved untrustworthy; but one remains - not wisdom, not valor, not riches, but the knowledge of the revealed God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a></div><div class="verse">But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <i>am</i> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <i>things</i> I delight, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. <span class="cmt_word">First, loving-kindness.</span> This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>, corrected version), and as here (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5, 6</a>), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. <span class="cmt_word">Next, judgment, or justice.</span> Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>). Then, <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <i>them which are</i> circumcised with the uncircumcised;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - A further enforcement of the doctrine that no outward privileges, if dissociated from inward moral vitality, will avail. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - All them which are <span class="cmt_word">circumcised with the uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the circumcised in uncircumcision</span>, or, as Ewald turns it, "all the uncircumcised-circumcised." But what does this enigmatical expression signify? Hitzig, Graf, and apparently Dr. Payne Smith, think that it has a twofold meaning: that, as applied to the Jews, it means circumcised in the flesh, but not in heart, and, as applied to the heathen, simply uncircumcised (the one-half of the phrase neutralizing the other, like "a knife without the blade," "angels with horns and hoofs," etc.). The latter meaning, however, is surely very improbable, and it would only become necessary if it were proved that circumcision was practiced by none of the nations mentioned but the Jews. This is not the case. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were circumcised in very early times (see the drawing of a bas-relief in the Temple of Chunsu at Karnak, given by Dr. Ebers in his 'Egypten und die Bucher Meets'). The assertion that only the priests underwent the operation has no older evidence than that of Origen (edit. Lommatzsch, 4:138), "in whose time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to ridicule and contempt." As to the Ammonites and Moabites, we have, unfortunately, no information. With regard to the Edomites, it is true that, according to Josephus ('Antiq.,' 13:9, 1), they were compelled to accept circumcision by John Hyrcanus. But it is still quite possible that, at an earlier period, the rite was practiced, just as it was among the ancient Arabs, the evidence for which is beyond question (see the writer's article, "Circumcision," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edit.). (On the statement that "all these [the] nations are uncircumcised," see below.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a></div><div class="verse">Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <i>these</i> nations <i>are</i> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <i>are</i> uncircumcised in the heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that are in the utmost corners</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that</span> <span class="accented">are corner-clipped</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that have the hair cut off about the ears and temples. Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, "Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all these nations are uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), "The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that "uncircumcised" is equivalent to "circumcised in uncircumcision" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
