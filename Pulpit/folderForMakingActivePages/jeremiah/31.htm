<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, The people <i>which were</i> left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; <i>even</i> Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> which were <span class="cmt_word">left of the sword,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">the people of those left of the sword.</span> The expression clearly implies that the Jews at the time spoken of had escaped, or were about to escape, in some great battle or some other kind of slaughter. Hence the finding grace in the wilderness cannot refer to the sequel of the passage through the Red Sea, and we must perforce explain it of the second great deliverance, viz. from the Babylonian exile. This view is strongly confirmed by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, where the Israelites who escape the predicted slaughter at Babylon are called "escaped ones from the sword," and exhorted to remember Jehovah and Jerusalem "afar off." The "wilderness" of the present passage, like the "afar off" of ch. 51. (and of the next verse) seems to mean Babylon, which was, by comparison with the highly favoured Judah, a "barren and dry land" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), a spiritual Arabia. It may be objected that the tense here is the perfect; but there is abundance of analogy for explaining it as the prophetic perfect. The restoration of the chosen people to favour is as certain in the Divine counsels as if it were already an event past. (It seems less appropriate to understand "the wilderness" of the country which separated Assyria from Palestine. It was in Babylon that the covenant of Sinai was renewed to God's repentant people.) <span class="cmt_word">Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when I went to cause Israel to rest</span> (literally, <span class="accented">to cause him</span> - <span class="accented">Israel</span> - <span class="accented">to rest</span>; but the pleonastic pronoun need not be represented in the English). Another possible and perhaps preferable rendering is, <span class="accented">I will go to cause</span>, etc. "Rest" could only be had in the consciousness of God's favor. With all the outward property of many of the Jews in Babylon, there was no true "rest." Comp. chap. 16, "Ask for the old paths.., and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls" (the same verbal root in the Hebrew for "rest" in both passages).

"From afar" (so we ought to render, rather than "of old") she sees Jehovah, with the eye of faith, approaching to redeem her; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a> and Isaiah 59:20 (only that in these passages it is to Jerusalem, and not to Babylon, that Jehovah "comes" as the Redeemer); also the promise in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>, "I will save thee from afar," and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, quoted above. (Septuagint reads "unto him;" but an abrupt change of person is not uncommon in Hebrew.) Saying, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I have loved thee,</span> etc. "Saying" is inserted to make the connection plainer. The genius of Hebrew does not require such a distinct indication of a change of speakers as our Western languages. For other instances of this, see <a href="../../par/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With loving kindness have I drawn thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">do I continue loving kindness unto thee.</span> "To continue" is literally, <span class="accented">to draw out at length.</span> The  idea is the same as that in the great prophecy which follows that of the suffering Saviour, "With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>; comp. ver. 10).

The people of Israel is personified as a virgin (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Adorned with thy tabrets,</span> The expression will not, of course, bear to be logically criticized, for it was not the whole people who went out with "tabrets" or "timbrels," but the "damsels," who, it is true, formed an important part of religious processions (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>), and doubtless of secular ones also (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>). Joyousness is an essential part of the Biblical ideal both of religion and of a normal state of society: "The joy of the Lord is your strength." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-5.htm">Jeremiah 31:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat <i>them</i> as common things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains of Samaria.</span> "Samaria" is used, equally with Ephraim, for the northern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Shall eat</span> them <span class="cmt_word">as common things;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall enjoy the fruit.</span> The word, however, literally means <span class="accented">shall profane them.</span> The more common phrase, "shall eat the fruit," occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a>, where the same promise is given. The law was that newly planted fruit trees should be left alone for three years; that in the fourth year their fruit should be consecrated to God; and that in the fifth year their fruit might be "profaned," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> devoted to ordinary uses (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>).

It was the custom, at any rate in later times, to station watchmen at elevated points to give notice of the first appearance of "the slender sickle, which shines so brightly in the clear Oriental heaven" Let us go up. Not with reference to the physical elevation of Jerusalem, for the phrase, "to go up," is used of an army withdrawing from Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>). This seems to indicate that the term was sometimes used in a weakened sense, to which parallels might easily be given. These words, "Arise ye, and let us go up," etc., were, at a later period, the formula with which the leader of the pilgrims from any particular district summoned the members of his caravan to fall into the procession.

The latter, too, are interested in the restoration of Israel, because Israel is as it were a "priest" or mediator for the other nations (<a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Among the chief of the nations;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of the chief of the nations.</span> Israel is called the "chief of the nations" (so, with a cognate word for "chief," in <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) because Jehovah has" chosen" it as his <span class="accented">peculium</span> (to use the language of the Vulgate), <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, and because no other nation "hath God so nigh unto them," and "hath statutes and judgments so righteous," as Israel (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7, 8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, <i>and</i> with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The weakest among the Israelites will share the blessings with the strongest, even <span class="cmt_word">the blind and the lame</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>, "The lame take the prey"). Elsewhere we are told that, in the Messianic age, "the eyes of the blind shall see," and "the lame man shall leap as an hart" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall return thither;</span> rather, <span class="accented">hither</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Palestine, where Jeremiah writes this prophecy. The word for <span class="cmt_word">company</span> is <span class="accented">hahal</span>, the proper word in the Pentateuch for the Israelitish national "congregation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a></div><div class="verse">They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim <i>is</i> my firstborn.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With weeping;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a joy dashed with sorrow at the thought of the sin which has rendered such an interposition necessary (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Cause them to walk by the rivers of waters.</span> The reference here is primarily to the homeward journey of the exiles, which shall be free from the trials of the first Exodus, but not exclusively (see on next verse). The question arises how this prediction is to be reconciled with facts. For, as Kimchi has remarked, we find no reference to miracles performed for the Jews who returned from Babylon. A twofold reply seems admissible. We may say either that to those who enjoy a vivid sense of the favour and protection of God no trial is grievous, no circumstances exclude an undercurrent of joy (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>.); or that the prophecy is still waiting for its complete fulfilment, Israel having still a great future reserved for it upon its recognition of the true Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">In a straight way;</span> or, <span class="accented">in an even way, i.e.</span> one free from hindrances. Comp. Ezra's prayer (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>), and <a href="../../par/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>, in both of which passages "right" should probably be "even." Ephraim is my firstborn. It is doubted whether this simply means that Ephraim (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> North Israel) shall be in no respect inferior to Judah - a strong form of expression being chosen, on account of the longer continuance of Ephraim's captivity; or whether it implies a restoration to the tribes of Joseph of the prerogative conferred upon the sons of Joseph (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>). The former view seems hardly consistent with the dignity of a prophetic writer. "Forms of expression,"  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rhetorical phrases, may be admitted in poetical passages, but hardly in solemn prophetic revelations. It was true that Judah had "prevailed above his brethren;" but the original "gift of God" to Ephraim was "without repentance." With regard to the fulfilment of this prediction, we must remember that the remnant of the northern tribes whose faith was strong enough to induce them to profit by the edict of Cyrus, was smaller than that of the southern. Hence the outward signs of God's favour to Ephraim could not be so great as they would have been had the moral conditions of the fulfilment of the promise been more fully complied with. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a></div><div class="verse">Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare <i>it</i> in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd <i>doth</i> his flock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The isles;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the distant countries of the West (see on Jeremiah 2:10). So great an event as the restoration of the chosen people would be of worldwide importance. <span class="cmt_word">He that scattered Israel will gather him,</span> etc. "The Israelites were the flock of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), but during the Captivity a scattered and miserable flock. Jeremiah says that his eye 'shall run down with tears, because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive' (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>). The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (<a href="../../par/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>)" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11).

The land of Ephraim is orphaned and desolate. The prophet seems to hear Rachel weeping for her banished children, and comforts her with the assurance that they shall yet be restored. For Ephraim has come to repentance, and longs for reconciliation with his God, and God, who has overheard his soliloquy, relents, and comes to meet him with gracious promises. Then another voice is heard summoning Ephraim to prepare for his journey home. This verse is quoted by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-17.htm">Matthew 2:17</a>) with reference to the massacre of the innocents, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> prefixed. The latter formula of itself suggests that there was a previous fulfilment of the prophecy, but that the analogy of the circumstances of the innocents justifies - nay, requires - the admission of a second fulfilment. In fact, the promise of the Messianic age seemed in as much danger of being rendered void when Herod wreaked his fury on the children of Bethlehem, as when the tribes of Israel were scattered in exile. Dean Stanley finds a geographical inconsistency in the two passages. "The context of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> implies that the Ramah of the prophet was in the northern kingdom, probably Ramah of Benjamin. The context of <a href="../../par/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, on the other hand, implies that the Ramah of the evangelist was within sight of Bethlehem" ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 225). But this remark involves the assumption that the quotation was not intended merely as an application. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice was heard;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is heard.</span> It is a participle, indicating the continuance of the action. <span class="cmt_word">In Ramah.</span> In the neighbourhood of which town Rachel was buried, according to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> ("the city" where Samuel and Saul were - <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a> - appears to have been Ramah). <span class="cmt_word">Rachel weeping for her children.</span> Rachel ("Rahel" is only a Germanizing way of writing the name), being the ancestress of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, is represented as feeling like a mother for all the tribes connected with those three. Her "weeping" is no mere figure of speech. Jeremiah believes that the patriarchs and holy men of old continue to feel an interest in the fortunes of their descendants (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-16.htm">Jeremiah 31:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Rachel is admonished to cease from weeping, because her work has not  really been in vain; her children shall be restored. <span class="cmt_word">Thy work shall be rewarded.</span> Like the Servant of the Lord, Rachel had said (though with the voiceless language of tears), "I have laboured in vain; I have spent my strength for nought and in vain;" and like the ocean mother of Zidon, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth children, neither nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>). Rachel's work had been that of rearing up the patriarchs, "in whose loins" the tribes themselves were, in a certain sense. <span class="cmt_word">From the land of the enemy;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the countries of Israel's dispersion. But in the spirit of St. Matthew, we may fill the passage with a higher meaning, of which the prophet (like Shakespeare sometimes) was unconscious, namely, "from death;" and the passage thus becomes an undesigned prophecy of the Resurrection.

She is directed to mark out the road for the returning exiles. The command is obviously the. torical in form; the general sense is that the Israelites are to call to mind the road so familiar to their forefathers, though only known to themselves by tradition. The word rendered "waymarks" occurs again in 2 Kings 33:17 and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>. It apparently means a stone pillar, which might be used either as a waymark or a sepulchral monument.

A passage in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>) will occur to every one, in which a psalmist, longing at a distance for the services of the temple, pronounces blessed the man "in whose heart are the highways [to Zion];" here, it is true, "heart" has the double meaning of "mind" and "affections," but "highway" has almost exactly the same sense as in the passage before us. <span class="cmt_word">To these thy cities</span>.

The phrase, however, is extremely difficult. Of other explanations, the most plausible philologically is that of Schnurrer and Gesenius, "a woman shall protect a man" (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>). The part of a sentinel, pacing round and round his charge, seems most unfitted for a woman. When enemies are abroad, it is the men's natural duty to perform this part for the women. But in the coming age, the country shall be so free from danger that the places of men and women may safely be reversed. But would a paradox of this kind be likely to be uttered in this connection? Surely a clearer statement would be necessary to remove the reluctance of the Israelites. Vers. 19, 20 suggest that Ephraim needed reassurance as to the attitude of Jehovah towards him. The promise of ver. 22, as explained above, would give precisely the needed strength and comfort. The exposition of St. Jerome and other Fathers, that the birth of Christ from a virgin is referred to, is altogether inadmissible, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the nouns which form the subject and the predicate respectively indicate sex, not age, and the first in particular cannot be tortured so as to mean "virgin;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is no article to confine the reference to any particular persons.

Jeremiah puts this more forcibly than the Authorized Version represents.

That Jehovah is meant is not an admissible view. A weak believer may say complainingly, "Why sleepest thou?" but God himself cannot be represented under the image of a sleeper. There seems, however, to be no reason why the prophet should not have used this language. The doubt is whether a real, physical sleep is meant, or merely an ecstatic condition resembling sleep. Hengstenberg decides for the latter. But there is no parallel for sleep in the sense of ecstasy, and, on the other hand, there is evidence enough for dreams as the channels of Divine revelation (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). As Naegelsbach points out, this is the only unqualifiedly comforting prophecy in the whole book, and may well have left a sweet savour in the prophet's memory. Stern, indeed, was the reality which the moment of his waking brought back to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-30.</span> - The physical side of the Messianic blessing. Its effect upon the heart of the pardoned sinners will be such that they will fully recognize the justice of the Divine judgments. There will no longer be any room for a certain favourite proverb; the death of a sinner will be universally acknowledged to be the reward of his personal sin (Keil). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sow</span>, etc. The passage may be illustrated by <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>, where the Church of the restored exiles is represented as complaining that the land (of Judah) has not been brought into a state of security, and that inhabitants (in sufficient numbers) have not been begotten. Similarly here, only the tone of complaint is wanting. The thought has suggested itself - Will the Israelites of the latter days be sufficient to fill up the land? Yes, is the answer of revelation; for Jehovah will perform a wonder, and make the people and their cattle so prolific that it will seem as if children and young cattle grew up like plants. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As I have watched... so will I watch,</span> etc. The allusion is to the twofold commission given to the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>), which was partly to pluck up and to destroy, partly to build and to plant. Jehovah has hitherto been "watchful" (another point of contact with ch. 1; see on Jeremiah 1:12) over the fulfilment of the destructive prophecies; he will now be equally zealous for that of the promises of regeneration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a></div><div class="verse">In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have eaten a sour grape;</span> rather, <span class="accented">sour grapes.</span> The prophet (like Ezekiel,  ch. 18.) condemns the use of this proverb, and declares that the sinner is the artificer of his own ruin. At first sight, it may seem as if Jeremiah opposes the second commandment, which describes how God "visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). This, however, cannot really be, for he endorses this declaration later on (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The fact is that he is not so much condemning the proverb, as the blasphemous application of it made by the Jews of his time. It is an eternal truth that sin perpetuates itself (except by the miracles of grace) in the children of transgressors, and intensified sin leads to intensified punishment. But the children of transgressors do not cease to be responsible for their own share in the sin; - this was the truth which Jeremiah's contemporaries ignored. He does not deny the solidarity of the family or the race,but he superadds the neglected truth of the special responsibility of the individual. This is one among many evidences of the deepening sense of individual life in the later period of the Jewish monarchy. (A somewhat different view is offered by Delitzsch, 'Messianic Prophecies,' &sect; 50. According to him, Jeremiah looks forward to a time when the individual shall be liberated from the consequences of his solidarity with his race, and when personality shall be "invested with its rights." But can the individual be thus liberated?)

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - The new covenant. A prophecy which stands out from the rest of Jeremiah by its evangelical character, in which it strongly reminds us of parts of the second half of Isaiah. The doctrine of the covenant is "the thread which binds together the hopes and the fears of the prophet, his certainty of coming woe, his certainty of ultimate blessing." A covenant was granted of old, but that covenant had on man's side been broken. Still "the gifts and calling of God are not to be retracted" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>); and Jeremiah felt that the very nature of God guaranteed the renewal of the covenant on a new basis. "Covenant" is, no doubt, an unfortunate rendering. The Hebrew word so rendered means, primarily, a decision or appointment, and there is a whole group of passages in the Old Testament which requires this meaning (see the present writer's note, in 'The Prophecies of Isaiah,' on Isaiah 42:6). We retain it, however, as that with which the reader is familiar, and only remind him that God is everything, and man nothing, in fixing the terms of the transaction. The characteristics of the new covenant are three: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The relation between God and his people is protected from all risk by God himself making the people what he would have them be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Whereas, in the case of the old, the law of duty was written on <span class="accented">tables of stone</span>, in the case of the new the law is to be written on the <span class="accented">heart</span>; whereas, under the old, owing to the ritual character of the worship, the knowledge of God and his will was a complicated affair, in which men generally were helplessly dependent on a professional class, under the new, the worship of God would be reduced to the simplest spiritual elements, and it would be in every man's power to know God at first hand, the sole requisite for such knowledge as would then be required being a pure heart." And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "whereas, under the old, the provisions for the cancelling of sin were very unsatisfactory, and utterly unfit to perfect the worshipper as to conscience, by dealing thoroughly with the problem of guilt, under the new God would grant to his people a real, absolute, and perennial forgiveness, so that the abiding relation between him and them should be as if sin had never existed" (Dr. A.B. Bruce, in <span class="accented">The Expositor</span>, January, 1880, pp. 70, 71). Comp. the abolition of the ark indicated in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>. - The inspired author of Hebrews tells us (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>), speaking generally, that this promise delivered through Jeremiah was fulfilled in the gospel. But it must be remembered that the gospel has not yet taken form outwardly, except in a comparatively meagre sense. If the Jews as a nation (that is, the better part or kernel of Israel) should embrace the gospel, not necessarily in the logical expression familiar to the West, but in its essential facts and truths, we should see quite another embodiment of the promise, and feel the spiritual impulse in ourselves as we have not yet done. It seems appropriate, in conclusion, to quote a finely expressed passage from De Quincey's exposition of the New Testament term <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. Without pledging ourselves to the absolute correctness of his explanation of that word, his language may be well applied to Jeremiah's prophecy. "What would have been thought of any prophet, if he should have promised to transfigurate the celestial mechanics; if he had said, 'I will create a new pole star, a new zodiac, and new laws of gravitation;' briefly, 'I will make new earth and new heavens'? And yet a thousand times more awful it was to undertake the writing Of new laws upon the spiritual conscience of man."

At the north, west corner (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>). Both this and the tower of Hananeel are mentioned together again in the prophecy of the glorification of Jerusalem, in <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a></div><div class="verse">And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Over against it upon the hill Gareb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">straight forward unto the hill Gareb.</span> The hill of Gareb is not mentioned elsewhere; its meaning is probably "Leper's Hill." It must, of course, have been outside the city, and may be identified (after Schleussner and Hitzig) with "the fourth hill, which is called Bezetha" (Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). <span class="cmt_word">To Goath;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to Goah.</span> But the reading of the Peshito, "to Gibeah," should probably be adopted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a></div><div class="verse">And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, <i>shall be</i> holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - The southern boundary of the city. <span class="cmt_word">The whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes;</span> rather,...  <span class="accented">even the dead bodies and the ashes.</span> It is assumed by most that Jeremiah means the valley of Hinnom, which, after its defilement by Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), had become a receptacle of rubbish and offal. It is, however, against this view that the word for "valley" is not <span class="accented">gai</span> (elsewhere connected with Hinnom), but <span class="accented">emek</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "deep lying plain." The "dead bodies" are the corpses of men and animals, destroyed by the judgment of God, and lying unburied; but where, seems uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Ashes</span>. Wood ashes are not here meant, but those of flesh and fat, which remained after the burning of a sacrificial victim (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>; and comp. 4:12). <span class="cmt_word">The horse gate.</span> Mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Holy unto the Lord.</span> The unclean spots in the neighbourhood having been transformed. The expression reminds us of <a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a> (the legend on the forefront of the high priest's mitre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/30.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 30"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 30" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/32.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 32"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 32" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
