When the Israelites had come to Rephidim which was probably in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady Esh-Sheikh, complaint arose, not, as at Marah (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), that there was no drinkable water, but that there was no water at all. Water had been expected, and consequently no supply had been brought; but none was found. Violent murmurs arose, and the people were ready to stone their leader (ver. 4), who had, they considered, brought them into the difficulty. As usual, Moses took his grief to God, and laid it before him, with the result that God gave miraculous relief. Moses was bidden to take his rod, and go with the elders to a particular rock known as "the rock in Horeb" (ver. 6), and there strike the rock, and water would flow forth. This he did, and a copious stream welled out, which furnished abundant drink to the whole multitude. In remembrance of the murmuring, he called the place Massah (trial) and Meribah (quarrel). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the wilderness of Sin</span>. See the comment on Exodus 16:1. The sandy coast tract (El Murka) was probably quitted in lat. 28&deg; 42' nearly, and the Wady Feiran entered on at its south-western extremity. Two stations, Dophkah and Alush, lay between the Sin wilderness and Rephidim, as we learn from <a href="../../par/numbers/33-12.htm">Numbers 33:12, 13</a>. It is impossible to locate these places with exactness. <span class="cmt_word">After their journeys</span>. The three stages - from Sin to Dophkah, from Dophkah to Alush, and from Alush to Rephidim - seem to be alluded to. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandment of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> Literally, "at the mouth of Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as God ordered them. The command was signified by the movement of the "pillar of the cloud." <span class="cmt_word">And pitched in Rephidim</span>. The word Rephidim signifies "resting places," and "is the natural name for the paradise of the Bedouins in the palm-grove where the church and palace of the bishops of Paran formerly stood "(Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). <span class="cmt_word">There was no water</span>. The Wady Feiran is watered ordinarily by a copious stream; but at times the brook is dry (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> p. 40, note 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people did chide.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.<span class="cmt_word"></span></span>  "quarrelled," made open murmurs and complaint - as before frequently (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Give us</span> <span class="cmt_word">water</span>. As Moses had already given them flesh (the quails) and bread (the manna), so it perhaps seemed to the people easy that he should give them such a common thing as water. Stanley notices (p. 70) that the wadys suggest the idea of water, and make its absence the more intolerable - they are "exactly like rivers," with "torrent bed, and banks, and clefts in the rock for tributary streams, and at times even rushes and shrubs fringing their course"  - signs of "water, water everywhere, yet not a drop to drink." <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord</span>? To "tempt the Lord" is to try his patience by want of faith, to arouse his anger, to provoke him to punish us. It was the special sin of the Israelites during the whole period of their sojourn in the wilderness. They "tempted and provoked the most high God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>); "provoked him to anger with their inventions" (<a href="../../par/psalms/106-29.htm">Psalm 106:29</a>), "murmured in their tents" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 25), "provoked him at the sea" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 7), "tempted him in the desert" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 14). God's long-suffering, notwithstanding all, is simply amazing! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people thirsted there for water.</span> There is probably no physical affliction comparable to intense thirst. His thirst was the only agony which drew from the Son of Man an acknowledgment of physical suffering, in the words "I thirst." Descriptions of thirst in open boats at sea are among the most painful of the records of afflicted humanity. Thirst in the desert can scarcely be less horrible. <span class="cmt_word">The people murmured and said</span> When the worst comes on men, if they are alone, they bear it silently; but if they can find a scapegoat, they murmur. To lay the blame of the situation on another is a huge satisfaction to the ordinary human mind, which shrinks from responsibility, and would fain shift the burthen on some one else. <span class="cmt_word">To kill us</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>,  16:3. The circumstances of their life in the wilderness were such, that, until accustomed to them, the people thought that, at each step, they must perish. It may be freely admitted, that without continual miraculous aid this would have been the natural <span class="accented">denouement</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">our cattle</span>. It is interesting to see that the "cattle" still survived, and were regarded as of great importance. How far they served as a secondary head of subsistance to the people during the 40 years, is a point not yet sufficiently elaborated.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-5.htm">Exodus 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> <span class="cmt_word">on before the people.</span> "Leave the people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "where they are, in Rephidim, and go on in front of them, with some of the elders as witnesses, that the miracle may be sufficiently attested." On the other occasion, when water was brought forth out of the rock (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8-11</a>), it was done in the presence of the people. Perhaps now there was a real danger of their stoning Moses, had he not quitted them. <span class="cmt_word">Thy rod with which</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou smotest the river.</span> See above, <a href="../../par/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>.

It cannot, however, have been very far distant from Rephidim. (See ver. 8.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He called the name of the place Massah</span>. Massah is from the root nasah, "to try," or "tempt," and means "trial" or "temptation." Meribah is from rub, "to chide, quarrel," and means "contention, chiding, strife." Moses gave the same name to the place near Kadesh, where water was once more brought out of the rock, near the end of the wanderings. (See <a href="../../par/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 17:8-16 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-16.</span> - THE WAR WITH AMALEK. The Amalekites seem to have been descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>). They separated themselves off from the other Edomites at an early date, and became the predominant tribe in the more northern parts of the Sinaitic peninsula, claiming and exercising a sovereignty over the whole of the desert country between the borders of Palestine and Egypt. We do not find the name Amalek in the Egyptian records; but the people are probably represented by the Mentu, with whom so many of the early Egyptian kings contended. The Pharaohs dispossessed them of the north-western portion of the mountain region; but they probably claimed the suzerainty of the central hills and valleys, which the Egyptians never occupied; and on these they no doubt set a high value as affording water and pasture for their flocks during the height of summer. When the Israelites pressed forward into these parts, the Amale-kites, in spite of the fact that they were a kindred race, determined on giving them battle. They began by "insidiously attacking the rear of the Hebrew army, when it was exhausted and weary" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>). I-laving cut off many stragglers, they attacked the main body at Rephidim, in the Wady-Feiran, and fought the long battle which the text describes (vers. 10-13). The result was the complete discomfiture of the assailants, who thenceforth avoided all contact with Israel until attacked in their turn at the southern frontier of Canaan, when, in conjunction with the Canaanites, they were victorious (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>). A bitter and long continued enmity followed. Amalek, "the first of the nations" to attack Israel (Exodus 24:20), was pursued with unrelenting hostility (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), defeated repeatedly by Saul and David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>); the last remnant of the nation being finally destroyed by the Simeonites in the reign of king Hezekiah, as related by the author of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Then came Amalek</span>. The bulk of the Amalekites would have been passing <span class="cmt_word"><span class="accented">the</span></span> spring in the lower plains, where herbage is abundant after the early rains, while later in the year it dries up. They would hear of the threatened occupation of their precious summer pastures by the vast host of the Hebrews, and would seek to prevent it by blocking the way. Hence they are said to have "come" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to have marched into a position where they were not previously, though it was one situated within their country. We must remember that they were nomads. <span class="cmt_word">And fought with Israel</span> For the nature of the fighting on the first day, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; by which it appears that the original attack was made on the rear of the long column, and was successful. The Amalekites "smote the hindmost" of the Israelites, "even all that were feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to Joshua.</span> On hearing what had happened, Moses summoned to his presence an Ephraimite in the prime of life - about 45 years old - and devolved on him the military command. The man's name at the time was Hoshea or Oshea (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>). He was the son of a certain Nun (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) or Non (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-27.htm">1 Chronicles 7:27</a>), and the tenth in descent from Ephraim, the son of Joseph (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 23-27). Some forty years later Moses changed his name from Hoshea to Jehoshua. which became contracted into Joshua. The occurrence of this form in the present passage may be accounted for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By Moses having written (or reviewed) Exodus late in his life; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By a later authorised reviser (Ezra?) having altered the text. <span class="cmt_word">Choose out for us men</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Select from the congregation such a number of fit men as appear to thee sufficient, and with them fight Amalek." To-morrow. It was probably evening, when Moses heard of the attack on his rear, and there was consequently no possibility of retrieving the disaster till the next day. lie could but make his arrangements for retrieving it. <span class="cmt_word">I will stand on the top of the hill</span>. It is implied that there was a conspicuous hill (gibeah), not a rock (tsur) in the near vicinity of Rephidim, whence Moses could see the fight, and be seen by those engaged in it. Dean Stanley finds all the conditions answered by an eminence on the south side of the Wady Feiran (Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). Others suggest the Jebel Tahuneh north of the same wady. <span class="cmt_word">With the rod of God in my hand.</span> Moses meant to indicate by this, that he looked for victory to God alone, and did not  trust in an "arm of flesh," while, nevertheless, he sent his soldiers to the combat. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hur</span>. Hur has not been mentioned hitherto. According to one Jewish tradition, he was the son, according to another, the husband of Miriam. Scripture only tells us of him, that he was descended from Judah, through Caleb the son of Hezron (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18-20</a>), and that his grandson, Bezaleel, was the artificer of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>). He is again associated with Aaron in <a href="../../par/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Moses held up his hand,...  Israel prevailed</span>. The elevation of Moses' hand, with the rod held in it, was an appeal to God for aid, and must be supposed to have been accompanied by fervent prayer to God, that he would help his people and give them victory over their enemies. So long as the hand was upraised, the Israelites prevailed; not because they saw it, and took it as directing them to continue the fight (Kalisch), but because God gave them strength, and vigour and courage, while Moses interceded, and left them to themselves when the intercession ceased, It may be said, that Moses might have continued to pray, though his hands were weary; but only those who have tried, know how difficult a thing it is to pray with any intensity for a continuance. Probably Moses' spiritual and physical powers collapsed together; and when he dropped his hand through physical fatigue, he rested also from his mental effort. To impress upon Israel the importance of intercessory prayer, God made success and failure alternate with its continuance and discontinuance, thus teaching his people a lesson of inestimable value. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">But Moses' hands <i>were</i> heavy; and they took a stone, and put <i>it</i> under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Moses' hands were heavy</span>. Moses, no doubt, held the rod alternately with one hand and the other, until both were so tired that he could hold them up no longer. It is this natural weariness which is expressed by the words - "his hands were heavy." When Aaron and Hut perceived this, they brought a stone for him to sit on, and then, standing one on either side of him, alternately <span class="cmt_word">supported his hands</span> until the sun set and the battle was over.
