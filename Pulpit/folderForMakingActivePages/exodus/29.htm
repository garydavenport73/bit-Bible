From the description of the priestly attire, the Divine Law-giver passed to the form of priestly consecration, whereof investiture in the "holy garments" was a part. The ceremony of consecration was to consist of four things: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ablution; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Investiture; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Chrism or Anointing with oil; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the directions given, we have, first, the preparation of the offerings (vers. 1-3); secondly, directions for the ablutions (ver. 4); thirdly, directions for the investiture of Aaron (vers. 5, 6), of his sons (vers. 8, 9); fourthly, directions for the anointing (ver. 7); and fifthly, directions as to the mode in which the sacrifices should be offered and disposed of (vers. 10-34). A command is then given that the ceremonies should be repeated every day for a week (ver. 35); and another, that the altar should receive consecration at the same time as the priests (vers. 36, 37). Additional light is thrown on most of these matters by the account contained in Leviticus (ch. 8.), of the manner in which Moses carried oat the directions here given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the thing that thou shalt do to them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "This is the ceremonial that thou shalt use on the occasion." There is a tacit reference to verse 41 of ch. 28, which had announced that the priests were to be consecrated. <span class="cmt_word">Take one young bullock</span>. The offerings were to be provided beforehand, so as to be in readiness when the investiture and anointing were over. Hence they are mentioned first. <span class="cmt_word">Rams without blemish</span>. Literally "perfect." On the offence to God of offering him blemished offerings, see <a href="../../par/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-14</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a></div><div class="verse">And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: <i>of</i> wheaten flour shalt thou make them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unleavened bread</span> was regarded as purer than leavened, since fermentation is a sort of corruption. See the comment on Exodus 12:15. <span class="cmt_word">Cakes</span> <span class="cmt_word">tempered with oil</span>. Literally, "mixed with oil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, having oil as one <span class="cmt_word">of</span> their ingredients, in contrast with the <span class="cmt_word">wafers,</span> which had oil poured over them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-3.htm">Exodus 29:3</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">them in the basket.</span> Rather, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">offer</span> them." A preliminary offering of the animals and of the "meat-offerings," in the lump seems to be intended. This, apparently, preceded the ablution. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">The Ablution</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the door of the tabernacle.</span> The great laver was to be placed between the entrance to the tabernacle and the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>). It was to this probably that Aaron and his sons were to be brought. Its main purpose was to be a lustral vessel, placed ready for the various ablutions which the law required (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 19-21). <span class="cmt_word">Thou .... shalt wash them with water.</span> Ablutions were an important part of the ceremonial of almost all ancient religions. In Egypt, the priests were compelled to wash themselves from head to foot in cold water twice every day, and twice every night (Herod. 2:37). In the religion of Zoroaster frequent washing with water was prescribed for many kinds of impurity (Zendavesta, 8. p. 271, et seq.). The Greeks were particularly addicted to ceremonies of which ablution formed a part; and it is to Rome that we are indebted both for the word and for the idea of "lustration." It is a true instinct which has taught men the analogy between physical and moral purity, and led them to typify the removal of spiritual, by the cleansing from physical, defilement. The religion given at Sinai set a stamp of approval in many points on what may be called "the religion of nature;" and among them on this. Ablutions were required of the priests, not only at consecration, but every time that they entered the tabernacle, or sacrificed on the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>). Washing was a main feature in the cleansing of leprosy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-54.htm">Leviticus 13:54, 58</a>) and of the leper.  (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>). It was also employed for the purification of many minor defilements (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-25.htm">Leviticus 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, etc.). At what date it first came into use in the admission of proselytes is uncertain. Whether the washing of consecration extended to the whole body, or was limited to the hands and feet, is also a point on which critics have disagreed, but one of no great importance. (See <a href="../../par/john/13-9.htm">John 13:9, 10</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-5.htm">Exodus 29:5</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The Investiture of Aaron</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take the garments</span>. The directions, as here given, are incomplete, and not quite in the right order. In the LXX. they are still more incomplete. For the full process of investiture, we mast look to <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7-9</a>. There we find that the process included nine acts. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The putting on of the linen tunic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The girding with the under-girdle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The putting on of the robe of the ephod. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The putting on of the ephod. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The girding with the curious girdle of the ephod. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The putting on of the breast-plate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The putting into the breast-plate of the Urim and Thummim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> The putting on of the mitre. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> The affixing to the mitre of the golden plate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second and seventh are omitted here; and the order of the fifth and sixth is inverted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The holy crown</span>. The plate of gold with its blue ribbon, or lace, formed a species of diadem, such as in the East seems to have been always regarded as the special emblem of royalty. An ornament of the kind seems to have been introduced into Egypt by Khuenaten or Amenophis IV. It marked the royal character of the high priest, who, as the main type of Christ in the Mosaic law, was bound to be "Prophet, Priest, and King." (Compare <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-9.htm">Leviticus 8:9</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour <i>it</i> upon his head, and anoint him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">The Chrism or Anointing</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The anointing oil</span> had been mentioned previously in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>, when "spices" had been required from the congregation to form a portion of it. Its composition is given in <a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>; a passage from which we gather that it was exceedingly rich and costly. <span class="cmt_word">And pour it upon his</span> <span class="cmt_word">head.</span> Compare <a href="../../par/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>. While ablution is a rite common to many religions, the religious use of unction is peculiar to the Mosaic and the Christian. In the Mosaic it was applied to initiate into their office the prophet, the priest, and the king. In Christianity it was originally a rite by which sick persons were miraculously cured (<a href="../../par/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14, 15</a>), from which use it was afterwards extended by ecclesiastical authority to other important ceremonies. The typical meaning under Christianity is clear; the oil represents the Holy Spirit, and the anointing the outpouring of that Spirit on those who are the objects of it. Christ himself obtained his title of Christ (or Messiah), because he was "anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power" (<a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). Under Mosaism this idea was, at most, latent. Unction was understood to mark <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dignity, because the olive was the first of trees (<a href="../../par/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Continuance, because oil preserves things for a long time from corruption. Unction with the holy oil of the sanctuary no doubt further signified consecration to God's service. It was applied not only to the priests, but to the tabernacle, the ark, the table of shew-bread with its vessels, the seven branched candlestick, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering, and the laver, all of which thereupon became "most holy" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-8.htm">Exodus 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="accented">The Investiture of Aaron's sons</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt bring his sons</span>. See verse 4. They were to be brought to the door of the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Put coats upon them</span>. The investiture of the high priest consisted of nine acts (see the comment on ver. 5); that of the ordinary priests of three only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The putting on of the linen tunics. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The girding with the girdles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The putting on of the cap. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They do not seem to have been anointed, as Aaron was, by having the holy oil poured upon their heads, but only by having some of it sprinkled upon their garments (ver. 21; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">The bonnets</span>. Rather "caps." There is no article. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.</span> Literally, "Thou shalt fill the hand of Aaron and the hand of his sons." Installation in an office was usually effected among the Eastern nations by putting into the hand of the official the insignia which marked his functions. In this particular case certain portions of the offerings were used as the insignia. See ver. 24. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-34.</span> - <span class="accented">The Consecration Offerings</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word"><span class="accented">-</span>  Thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">the</span> bullock," - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the bullock mentioned in ver. 1, which was to be made ready before the ceremonies commenced." Aaron and his sons were <span class="cmt_word">to put their hands upon the head of the bullock</span>, in order to identify themselves with it, and transfer to it the guilt of their own sins and imperfections, since it was to be a "sin-offering" (ver. 14; compare <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-11.htm">Exodus 29:11</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, <i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take of the blood,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and put it upon</span> <span class="cmt_word">the horns of the altar</span>. The virtue of the altar was regarded as residing especially in its horns. Here expiation was obtained by the blood - "which is the life " - of the victim being first smeared upon the four horns, and then the remainder poured out at the altar's base. Such was the usual practice with "sin-offerings" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>) whereof this was to be the first example.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul <i>that is</i> above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that <i>is</i> upon them, and burn <i>them</i> upon the altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take all the fat</span>, etc. Among all nations who have offered sacrifices, it has been very usual to select certain parts of the victim only for burning upon the altar, and to dispose otherwise of the remainder. The Greeks commonly burnt on the altar the thighs and the fat only. The Romans burnt certain parts of the intestines only, and called them <span class="accented">prosecta</span>, <span class="accented">prosiciae</span>, or <span class="accented">ablegmina</span>. In Egypt, according to Herodotus, the greater part of the body was burnt; but the head, the neck, the shoulders, and the lower part of the legs, as well as the paunch, were reserved and not burnt (Herod. 2:40). The fat was generally regarded as the best part of the offering, and most acceptable to the gods. This was probably on account of its burning with a bright flame and helping to consume the rest of the offering. <span class="cmt_word">The caul that is above the liver</span>. Probably the membrane which covers the upper part of the liver, sometimes called "the small omentum." (reticulum jecoris, Vulg.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a></div><div class="verse">But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it <i>is</i> a sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The flesh... shalt thou burn with fire without the camp</span>. Such was the rule with sin-offerings generally (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-11.htm">Leviticus 4:11, 12</a>). The curse of sin which was on them, made them unfit for food and even unworthy of burial within the camp. On the symbolism of the burial, see <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His dung</span>. That which the bowels contained at the time of death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One ram</span>. Literally "the one ram" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "one of the two rams mentioned in verse 1. <span class="cmt_word">Put their hands</span>. Here, again, the object was to identify themselves with the victim, and make it their representative; though now, as the ram was to be a burnt offering, self-sacrifice, rather than expiation, was the leading thought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-16.htm">Exodus 29:16</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle <i>it</i> round about upon the altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take his blood and sprinkle it</span>. Rather, "and <span class="accented">cast</span> it." The blood was to be thrown from a basin, not sprinkled with the hand or with hyssop. Rabbinical tradition says that it was so cast at two of the corners, and thus moistened all the four sides. This was regarded as casting it "on the altar round about." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-17.htm">Exodus 29:17</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put <i>them</i> unto his pieces, and unto his head.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt cut the ram in</span> <span class="cmt_word">pieces.</span> Literally, "into <span class="accented">its</span> pieces," which Kalisch supposes to mean "into its natural limbs." Egyptian sculptures show us animals thus cut up, and offered at sacrificial feasts to ancestors. <span class="cmt_word">Wash its inwards</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, its "intestines" - probably the stomach and bowels only. <span class="cmt_word">Its legs</span>. The lower joints of the leg, with the foot, to which it was likely that dust might attach. <span class="cmt_word">Put them unto his pieces</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "replace them after washing with the other pieces," or joints, into which the animal had been cut.

This became the general law of the burnt-offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a>). It indicated that self-sacrifice was wholly acceptable to God; whereas in sin-offerings there was a taint of evil which rendered all but certain parts of the victim unacceptable (ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">A sweet savour.</span> This is not to be understood in the coarse sense in which heathen writers used similar expressions, meaning by them (as it would seem) that the gods were really pleased with the odour of sacrifices. No candid mind can ascribe to the Hebrews such anthropomorphism. Evidently no more is meant than that the offering would be pleasing to God. See <a href="../../par/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a>, etc.

Compare ver. 15; and see also vers. I and 3, where two rams had been mentioned. This second ram is called, "the ram of consecration" in ver. 22, and again in <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22</a>. It was "by far the most peculiar part of the whole ceremony" (S. Clark). It must be viewed as a "peace-offering" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>), but one of a peculiar character. The application of the blood to the persons of the priests was altogether unique, and most significant. It was the crowning act of consecration, and implied the complete dedication of their life and of all their powers to the service of the Almighty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-20.htm">Exodus 29:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put <i>it</i> upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The victim having been offered and accepted, its blood had a sanctifying power. <span class="cmt_word">Placed upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons,</span> it sanctified that organ, which was to be ever open to the Divine voice; placed <span class="cmt_word">upon the thumb of their right hand</span>, it sanctified their ministerial actions; placed <span class="cmt_word">upon the great toe of their right foot</span>, it sanctified their whole walk in life, their "going out," and their "coming in." The consecrated life of the victim which they had offered "was given back to them, in order that it might be devoted to the service of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/29-21.htm">Exodus 29:21</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt take of the blood that <i>is</i> upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle <i>it</i> upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take of the blood...  . and of the anointing oil.</span> Apparently, this is the only unction that the ordinary priests were to receive. (Compare <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>.) The mixture of the blood with the oil is unusual, and presents some difficulties; but perhaps it is best to view it as symbolising the intimate union which exists between justification and sanctification - the atoning blood, and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">And sprinkle it</span>. The verb is different from that used in ver. 16, and is rightly rendered, "sprinkle." <span class="cmt_word">He shall be hallowed and his garments</span>. As the garments shared in the sprinkling, they shared also, so far as was possible, in the consecration. It was hence especially that they became "holy garments."

The offerings were to be laid first, on the hands of Aaron, and then on those of his sons, which were to support them; while Moses, putting his hands under theirs, made a waving motion with them towards the four corners of the heavens, to indicate that the gifts were offered to the omnipresent God. This process was that "filling of the hand," by which the actual installation in office took place. Moses, by the act, transferred the priestly functions, which he had hitherto exercised, to his brother and his brother's descendants. He made them by his muscular energy perform their first priestly act.

The consecration of the altar, which is made a part of the consecration of the priests, is to be followed immediately by the establishment of the daily sacrifice. Two lambs are to be offered day by day to the Lord, one in the morning and the other in the evening, as "a continual burnt-offering" (ver. 42), in acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Jehovah (Cook), aria that they were bound to offer perpetually "themselves, their souls and bodies, to be a reasonable  holy, and lively sacrifice" to him. The burnt-offerings were to be accompanied by appropriate "meat and drink-offerings" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a certain quantity of flour mingled with olive oil for the one, and a certain quantity of wine for the other - indications of the debt of gratitude which the nation owed to God for his continual benefits <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lambs of the first year</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>. The LXX. add "without blemish."

The application of the "drink-offerings" is uncertain. Josephus says (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:9, &sect; 4) that they were poured out round the brazen altar. But the analogy of the "meat offering" makes it probable that a portion only was thus treated, while the greater part belonged to the priests. In the entire provision by which burnt and peace-offering were to be necessarily accompanied with meat-offerings and drink-offerings, we can scarcely be wrong in seeing an arrangement made especially for the convenience of the priests.

The chapter terminates with a parenthetic insertion of various promises, intended to cheer the Israelites under the hard circumstances of their wanderings in the wilderness, and growing out of the mention of the tabernacle as "the tabernacle of meeting" (ver. 42). "There," says God, "He will meet, not only Moses, to speak to him, but also the children of Israel, to receive their offerings, hear their prayers, and grant their requests. There will he meet them, and there his glory shall be; and the tabernacle shall be thereby sanctified. He will sanctify both the tabernacle and the altar; he will sanctify, moreover, both Aaron and his sons; and he will dwell among the children of Israel, and be their God; and they shall know him." Very precious and gracious promises, made absolutely; though, as the result showed (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-18</a>), contingent on their obedience; and faithfully performed, as long as even a remnant was obedient, during a space of above seven hundred years from the Exodus to the Captivity! <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There will I meet the children of Israel</span>. Lay Israelites might not enter the tabernacle, and could only "meet God" at its entrance, when they brought their sacrifices to the altar. He promises, however, to meet them on these occasions with favour and. acceptance<span class="cmt_word">. The tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>. The presence of the Shechinah was the true sanctification of the tabernacle - all the rest was mere type and figure. God not only "put his name there," but put his presence there visibly.

Thus the altar had its miraculous sanctification, as well as the tabernacle, and was not merely consecrated by human instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify also both Aaron and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that here also something more is intended than had been accomplished by the rites of consecration. The verb is in the future - "I will sanctify" - and must allude to something which has not yet taken place. Probably, sanctification of the spirit is intended - that Divine influence upon the heart which alone makes men really and truly "holy." (Compare <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9, 16</a>.) But in this case the promise must have been conditional.
