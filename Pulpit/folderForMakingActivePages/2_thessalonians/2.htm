Thus Calvin: "He adjures believers by the coming of Christ; for it is customary to adjure by those things which are regarded by us with reverence." But such a construction is unknown in the New Testament, and is besides unnatural. Others render the preposition "in behalf of" or "in the interest of," "as though he were pleading, in honour of that day, that the expectation of it might not be a source of disorder in the Church" (Jowett); but such a sense is too artificial. It is best to render it "concerning," or, as in the R.V., "touching." <span class="cmt_word">The coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Some (Whitby, Hammond) suppose that by the coming of the Lord Jesus was here meant his coming in spirit at the destruction of Jerusalem, and that the apostasy was the revolt of the Jews from the Romans; the restraining power being differently interpreted. But this is a forced and extravagant interpretation, and is completely overthrown by what the apostle says in the next verse, for the destruction of Jerusalem was imminent. Besides, the Thessalonians, who were chiefly Gentile converts, were too distant from Jerusalem to be much troubled by the destruction of that city. By the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, then, is here meant, as is the uniform meaning of the phrase in the writings of Paul, the second advent. <span class="cmt_word">And by</span> (or, <span class="accented">concerning</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>our gathering together unto him.</span> The word translated "gathering together" occurs only once again in the New Testament, where it is used with reference to the assembling of Christians for worship (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35</a>). Here it is used with reference to the assembling of believers to Christ, when he shall be revealed from heaven; it refers, not to the raising of the dead, but to the gathering together of those who are then alive (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; to the end that, the purpose for which the apostle besought the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">Ye be not soon</span>; <span class="accented">quickly.</span> This has been variously interpreted, "so soon after my exhortation," or "so soon after my departure from Thessalonica," or "so soon after your reception of the gospel," or "so soon after this opinion of the imminence of Christ's coming was promulgated." Others refer it to manner rather than to time - "soon and with small reason" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Shaken</span>; agitated like the waves by a storm, as the word signifies. <span class="cmt_word">In mind;</span> or <span class="accented">rather, from your mind</span>;<span class="accented">from your sober reason. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Or be troubled;</span> a still stronger expression; "terrified." <span class="cmt_word">Neither by spirit;</span> not any falsely understood prophecies of the Old Testament, nor any mistaken revelations, whether by visions or dreams; but prophetical discourses delivered by members of the Church in a state of excitement, announcing the immediate coming of Christ, and which were mistaken for Divine communications. There does not appear to have been any intention to deceive; the Thessalonians erred in neglecting "to try the spirits" and to "prove the prophecics." <span class="cmt_word">Nor by word;</span> not any traditional word of Christ, nor any misinterpretation of his prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, nor a calm discourse in distinction from prophetic utterances; but the  report of some of the apostle's words, either erroneous or misunderstood. <span class="cmt_word">Nor by letter.</span> Not the apostle's former Epistle to the Thessalonians, the passages in which concerning the advent had been misinterpreted (Paley); for, if this were the case, the apostle would have expressed himself more plainly and would not have repudiated it; but some letter, either forged in the apostle's name or pretending to inculcate his views. <span class="cmt_word">As from us.</span> These words apply to the last two particulars: "Let no pretended saying or pretended letter of mine disturb you in this matter." <span class="cmt_word">As that</span> - to the effect that - <span class="cmt_word">the day of Christ;</span> or, as the best manuscripts read, <span class="accented">of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is at hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is present</span>, so R.V. The verb is so translated in the other passages where it occurs (<a href="../../par/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>), except in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>, where it ought also to have been so rendered. It is, however, difficult to conceive how the Thessalonians could think that the day of the Lord was actually present. We cannot imagine that they thought that Christ had already come for judgment. To escape the difficulty, some conceive that "the day of the Lord" is not identical with "the coming of the Lord," but that, besides the actual advent, it includes the events which are its antecedents and concomitants (Eadie). It appears, however, best to suppose that the word is a strong expression for the imminence of that day; that the hour of the advent was about in strike. The Thessalonians ought always to be living in a state of preparation for the day of the Lord, as that day would come suddenly and unexpectedly; but they were not to be so impressed with a sense of its immediateness as to be deprived of their sober reason. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">Let no man deceive you by any means: for <i>that day shall not come</i>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no man deceive you by any means;</span> in any way, not only in any of the foregoing methods, "by spirit, or word, or letter," but in any way whatever. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="accented">that day shall not come</span>). The bracketed words are not in the original, but are correctly supplied for the completion of the sense. <span class="cmt_word">Except there come a falling away;</span> or, <span class="accented">the apostasy</span>; namely, that apostasy about which the apostle, when in Thessalonica, had instructed his readers. The falling away here alluded to is evidently religious, not political. Hence it cannot be the revolt of the Jews from the Romans, or any of those revolts and disturbances which then occurred in the political world. Nor must we conceive that the man of sin himself is here meant; for this apostasy precedes his coming - prepares the way for his advent; it is not the result, but the cause, of his appearance. The word, then, is to be taken generally to denote that remarkable "falling away" from Christianity concerning which Paul had instructed the Thessalonians (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">First</span>; namely, before the coming of the day of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">And that man of sin;</span> in whom sin is, as it were, personified, as righteousness is in Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Be revealed.</span> The apostle considers the man of sin as the counterpart of Christ; as Christ was revealed, so shall the man of sin be revealed. <span class="cmt_word">The son of perdition;</span> whose sin necessarily conducts to perdition; not here the perdition of his followers, but his own perdition. The same name which was applied by our Lord to Judas Iscariot (<a href="../../par/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who opposeth;</span> or, <span class="accented">the opposer</span>, taken substantively. The object of opposition is not so much believers, as Christ; he is antichrist, the opponent of Christ. And yet antichrist is not Satan, the great adversary (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>), for he is expressly distinguished from him (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), but the instrument of Satan. As Satan entered into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of perdition, so does he take possession of the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And exalteth himself above;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">against</span>, in a hostile manner. <span class="cmt_word">All that is called God;</span> not only against all the false gods of the heathen, but also against the true God (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or that is worshipped;</span> that is an object of worship. The same word that is used in <a href="../../par/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, "As I passed by and beheld your devotions" - the objects of your worship. <span class="cmt_word">So that he as God.</span> The words "as God" are to be omitted, as not found in the best manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Sitteth in the temple of God.</span> According to some, the temple of Jerusalem (De Wette, Lunemann, Eadie), either as it then existed or as restored according to the prophecy of Ezekiel But it appears more correct to refer the expression metaphorically to the Christian Church. It is a favourite metaphor of Paul to compare believers in particular, or the Church in general, to the temple of God (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Showing</span> - exhibiting - <span class="cmt_word">himself that he is God.</span> His sitting in the temple of God was an assertion of his divinity; he claimed to be regarded and worshipped as God. This was the crowning act of his impiety; not only, like the Roman emperors, he demanded to be worshipped as one of many gods, but he claimed to himself the prerogative of the Godhead, not only to the exclusion of the false gods of heathenism, but even of the tree God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</span> These words contain a reproach. Had the Thessalonians remembered the instructions of the apostle, they would not have been so soon shaken from their sober reason or troubled. The apostle, when he was in  Thessalonica, had told them of these things; he had instructed them concerning the nature of the apostasy and the coming of the man of sin; so that, as already observed, this description, so obscure to us, was not obscure to the Thessalonians, - they possessed the key to its interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now.</span> The particle "now" has been variously interpreted. Some connect it with the restraining influence: "And ye know what now withholdeth;" but if so, there would have been a different arrangement of the words in the original Others consider it as a mere particle of transition: "Now, to pass over to another subject;" but there is no transition, the apostle continues his description of the man of sin. It is rather to be considered as a particle of time: "Now ye know, because you have been instructed on this point." <span class="cmt_word">Ye know;</span> Paul having told them when he was at Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">What withholdeth</span>; hindereth. The hindrance does not refer to the prevention of the apostle from speaking freely on this subject, lest he should involve himself in political difficulties; nor to any delay in the coming of Christ; but to a restraint upon the appearance of the man of sin: "Ye know what prevents his open manifestation." <span class="cmt_word">That he;</span> namely, the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Might be revealed in his time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in his season</span>; in his proper time, the time appointed by God. Events were not yet ripe for his appearance. Just as there was a "fulness of time" when Christ should appear (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), so there was a "fulness of time" when the man of sin should be revealed; there was a series of events going on which would culminate in his revelation. The nature of this restraining or withholding influence will afterwards be considered; whatever it was, the Thessalonians were formerly explicitly informed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth <i>will let</i>, until he be taken out of the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the mystery.</span> "Mystery" here denotes something which was unknown or secret before it was revealed (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>). So also one of the names of Babylon, the seat of the antichristian power, is Mystery (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of iniquity;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of lawlessness</span>; namely, this apostasy which shall precede the coming of the man of sin. The genitive here is that of apposition - "that mystery which is <span class="accented">lawlessness,"</span> whose essence and sphere of operation is lawlessness. <span class="cmt_word">Doth already work;</span> or, <span class="accented">is already working.</span> The mystery of iniquity even now works in secret; but the man of sin himself will not appear until the restraining power be removed. Even at the time the apostle wrote the seeds of apostasy were already sown; the leaven of lawlessness was fermenting inside Christianity; the foundations of a false Christianity were being laid. Thus the apostle warned the Ephesians that false teachers would arise from among themselves; to Timothy he writes of those perilous times which were then present; and, in his Epistles, mention is made of false practices and doctrines, such as the worship of angels, abstinence from meats, bodily mortifications, and the honour conferred on celibacy. So also John, in his First Epistle, refers to this working of this antichristian power when he says, "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists .... Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>). "Antichrist does not step on the scene suddenly without any preparations; on the contrary, a stream of anti-christian sentiment and conduct pervades the whole history of the world" (Olshausen). <span class="cmt_word">Only he that now letteth;</span> or, <span class="accented">restraineth</span>, the old meaning of the word "let." <span class="accented">Will let.</span> These words are not in the original, and ought to be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Until he be taken out of the way.</span> The whole clause ought to be rendered, "The mystery of lawlessness is already working, only until he who restraineth is removed;" when that takes place, when the restraining influence is removed, the mystery of lawlessness will no longer work secretly, but will be openly manifested. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then;</span> namely, so soon as he that restraineth is taken out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">Shall that Wicked;</span> or, <span class="accented">that lawless one</span>, in whom the mystery of lawlessness is realized; not different from, but the same with, the "man of sin, the son of perdition." <span class="cmt_word">Be revealed;</span> appear unveiled in all his naked deformity. No longer working secretly, but openly, and in an undisguised form; no longer the mystery, but the revelation of lawlessness. The apostle now interrupts his description of the man of sin by announcing his doom. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord;</span> or, as the best attested manuscripts read, <span class="accented">whom the Lord Jesus.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall consume;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">shall slay</span> (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">With the spirit</span> (or, <span class="accented">breath</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his mouth.</span> Various interpretations have been given to this clause. Some refer it to the Word of God, and others to the Holy Spirit, and suppose that the conversion of the world is here predicted; but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation, as the doom of antichrist is here announced. Others refer the term to a cry or word, and think that the sentence of condemnation pronounced by the Lord Jesus on the wicked is intended. But the words are to be taken literally as a description of the power and  irresistible might of Christ at his coming - that the mere breath of his mouth is sufficient to consume the wicked (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall destroy</span> (or, <span class="accented">annihilate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the brightness</span> (or, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his coming.</span> The two words, <span class="accented">epiphany</span> and <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which are elsewhere used separately to denote the coming of Christ, are here employed. There is no ground for the assertion that the first is the subjective and the second the objective aspect of Christ's coming (Olshausen). The brightness of Christ's coming is not here expressed; but the meaning is that the mere appearance of Christ's presence will annihilate the wicked.

Here, also, the counterpart to Christ is manifest; for the same terms - "powers," "signs," and "wonders," are employed to denote his miracles (<a href="../../par/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). The miracles of Christ were miracles of truth; the miracles of the man of sin would be miracles of falsehood. There does not seem to be any essential difference between powers, signs, and wonders; but the words are employed as a mere rhetorical enumeration. It is not to be supposed that the man of sin will be enabled to perform real miracles; they are the wonders of falsehood; but still by them his followers will be deceived (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>).

The man of sin works by deceit and falsehood; and by means of imposture and wonders and high pretensions he will succeed in imposing on the world. The energetic power of the man of sin is, however, by no means irresistible; only they who perish will succumb to it. <span class="cmt_word">In them.</span> In the best manuscripts the preposition "in" is wanting; therefore the words are to be translated <span class="accented">for them</span> or <span class="accented">to them. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That perish</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>); <span class="cmt_word">because they received not the love of the truth.</span> Not only did they not receive the truth when it was offered them, but, what was worse, they were destitute even of a love of the truth. By the truth here is meant, not Christ himself, as some expositors think, but primarily the Christian truth, and secondarily the truth generally. There was in them a want of susceptibility for the truth, and thus not only were they prevented embracing the gospel, but they were led astray by numerous errors and delusions. <span class="cmt_word">That they might be saved.</span> The result which naturally would arise from the reception of the truth.

These words are not to be weakened, as if they meant merely that in righteous judgment God permitted strong delusion to be sent them; the words are not a mere assertion of judicial permission, but of actual retribution. It is the ordinance of God that the wicked by their wicked actions fall into greater wickedness, and that thus sin is punished by sin; and what is an ordinance of God is appointed by God himself. <span class="cmt_word">That they should believe a lie;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">the lie</span>, namely the falsehood which the man of sin disseminates by his deceit of unrighteousness.

Its reception would have been the cause of their salvation; its rejection results in their condemnation. <span class="cmt_word">They all might be damned;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">judged</span> (R.V.).

By some restricted to Paul, and by others as including Silas and Timotheus (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are bound to give thanks alway to God.</span> Notwithstanding the disorders which had arisen in the Church of Thessalonica, Paul had abundant reason to thank God for his great grace vouchsafed to the Thessalonians, in retaining them in the gospel, and in enabling them to abound in faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">For you, brethren beloved of the Lord;</span> that is, of Christ. In the former Epistle he calls them "beloved of God" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>), here "of Christ;" one of the numerous indirect proofs in these Epistles of the 1)trinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Because God hath from the beginning.</span> Some valuable manuscripts read, "because God hath chosen you as firstfruits," and this rendering has been adopted by several eminent expositors (Jowett, Hofmann, Riggenbach); but the preponderance of authorities is in favour of the reading in our A.V. The phrase, "from the beginning, does not denote "from the beginning' of the gospel," but "from eternity." The apostle refers the salvation of the Thessalonians to the eternal election of God. <span class="cmt_word">Chosen you to salvation</span> - the final purpose of God's election. <span class="cmt_word">Through</span>; or rather, in, denoting the elements in which the salvation consisted, or, which is the same thing, the state into which they were chosen. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctification of the Spirit</span> - the Divine side - <span class="cmt_word">and belief of the truth</span> - the human side of the element in which the salvation was realized.

The last meaning is the correct one. Believers are constituted "heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ."
