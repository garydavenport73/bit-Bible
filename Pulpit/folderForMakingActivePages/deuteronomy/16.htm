This injunction refers primarily to the preparation of the Paschal lamb for a festal meal (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>); but here it is used in a wider sense as referring to the whole Paschal observance, which lasted for seven days.

The animal for the Paschal supper was expressly prescribed to be a yearling of the sheep or of the goats (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), and this was to be consumed at one meal; but on the other days of the festival the flesh of other animals offered in sacrifice might be eaten. The term "Passover" here, accordingly, embraces the whole of the festive meals connected with the Passover proper - what the rabbins call <span class="accented">chagigah</span> (Maimon., in 'Kor-ban Pesach,' c. 10. &sect; 12; cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, etc.).

Of the latter no mention is made here, as the law regarding them was already sufficiently proclaimed (<a href="../../par/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29.); and in a popular address it was rather to what depended on the will of the people than to what was imperative by law, that attention had to be directed.

Whilst the people were in the wilderness, united as one body and under the leadership of Moses, this arrangement was sufficient; but a more extended arrangement would be required when they came to be settled in Canaan and dispersed in towns and villages over the whole land.

No instruction is given as to the number of judges and officers, or as to the mode of appointing them; nor was this necessary. The former would be determined by the size and population of the place where they were appointed, and the latter would, as a matter of course, follow the method instituted by Moses in the earlier arrangement (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-26</a>).

Here, indeed, the word "plant" is used, but this is only because, as the asherah was sunk in the earth that it might stand firm, it might be figuratively said to be planted, just as nails driven in are said to be planted (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>, where the same verb is used; comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-15.htm">Amos 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>).
