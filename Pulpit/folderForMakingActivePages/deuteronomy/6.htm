Being about to enjoin upon the people the commandments they were to obey in the land on which they were about to enter, Moses prefaces this with a general announcement of what he was about to deliver, and with a statement of the reason for such deliverance, and of the benefits that would flow from the observance of what should be enjoined. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the commandments.</span> In the Hebrew it is, <span class="accented">This is the commandment</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sum and substance of the Divine enactment; equivalent to "the Law" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-44.htm">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>). "The statutes and judgments" (rights) are in apposition to "the commandment," and explain it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do <i>it</i>; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - God had promised from the first to the patriarchs that he would make of their posterity a great nation (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). But the fulfillment of this promise was conditioned by their continuing as a people in the fear of God, and in obedience to his Law. Everything, then, depended on their hearing what Moses had been commanded to teach them, and observing to do it (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In the land</span>, etc. This is to be connected with the clause, "that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily;" the land was to be the scene and sphere of their prosperity and increase. Some would render thus: "As the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee a laud," etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a place in which thou mayest prosper and increase; the other, however, is the more natural construction and rendering. There is, indeed, no preposition before "the land" in the Hebrew; but nothing is more common in that language than for the accusative of a noun to be used adverbially to describe the place where anything is done. <span class="cmt_word">Milk and honey</span>; emblem of fruitfulness and sweetness (<a href="../../par/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>); proverbially descriptive of Canaan, as rich in pasturage for flocks, and abounding in flowers whence the bees could extract honey (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God <i>is</i> one LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-25.</span> - THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. "In the fear of Jehovah all true obedience is rooted (vers. 2, 3); for this is the first and most intimate fact in the relation of Israel and Jehovah (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). But where the supreme fear of Jehovah hinders men from allowing self to preponderate in opposition to God, there will be no stopping at this renunciation of self-will, though this comes first as the negative form of the ten commandments also shows, but there will come to be a coalescence of the human with the Divine will; and this is love, which is the proper condition of obedience, as the ten commandments also indicate (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-10.htm">Deuteronomy 5:10</a>)" (Baumgarten). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.</span> This is an affirmation not so much of the <span class="accented">moneity</span> as of the <span class="accented">unity</span> and <span class="accented">simplicity</span> of Jehovah, the alone God. Though Elohim (plu.), he is one. The speaker does not say, "Jehovah is alone God," but "Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah" (comp. for the force of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16-19</a>). Among the heathen there were many Baals and many Jupiters; and it was believed that the deity might be divided and communicated to many. But the God of Israel, Jehovah, is one, indivisible and incommunicable. He is the Absolute and the  Infinite One, who alone is to be worshipped, on whom all depend, and to whose command all must yield obedience (cf. <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). Not only to polytheism, but to pantheism, and to the conception of a localized or national deity, is this declaration of the unity of Jehovah opposed. With these words the Jews begin their daily liturgy, morning and evening; the sentence expresses the essence of their religious belief; and so familiar is it to their thought and speech that, it is said, they were often, during the persecution in Spain, betrayed to their enemies by the involuntary utterance of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - To the one indivisible Jehovah undivided devotion and love are due. Hence the injunction, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span> The "heart" is the inner nature of the man, including his intellectual, emotional, and cognitive futurities; the "soul" is the personality, the entire self-consciousness; and the" might" is the sum of the energies, bodily and mental. Not by profession merely is Jehovah to be loved; the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, is to be yielded to him in holy and devout affection (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The last letter Of the first word, and the last letter of the last word in this verse are larger than the ordinary size (<span class="accented">majuscula</span>), and as these two form the word for witness (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span>), the Jews say that they are written thus "that every one may know, when he professes the unity of God, that his heart ought to be intent and devoid of every other thought, because God is a <span class="accented">witness</span>, and knoweth everything" (R. Bechai, fol. 195, quoted by Michaelis, 'Bib. Heb,' in loc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Where true love to God exists in the heart, it will manifest itself in a regard to his will, and in the diligent keeping of his commandments. Hence his words were to be not only in the memory of the people, but laid upon their heart (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>), that they might be ever present to the thought and will. They were also to be inculcated upon their children, and to be the subject of conversation on all fitting occasions between them, the members of their household, and even their casual associates. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Thou shalt sharpen them to thy children</span>, impress them upon them, send them into them like a sharp weapon.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The words of God were to be bound for <span class="cmt_word">a sign</span> [a memorial or directory] <span class="cmt_word">upon thine hand</span>, the instrument of acting, and to be as <span class="cmt_word">frontlets</span> [fillets or bands] <span class="cmt_word">between thine eyes</span>, the organs of direction in walking or moving, and so on the forehead, the chamber of thought and purpose; and they were to inscribe them on the posts of their houses, and on their gates. The purport of this is that they were constantly and everywhere to have these commandments of the Lord in view and in mind, so as to undeviatingly observe them. It seems, however, to have been a custom widely prevalent among the ancient Eastern peoples to carry about their persons slips of parchment or some other material, on which were written sentences of moral or religious import; and such sentences they were also wont to inscribe on conspicuous places of their dwellings; usages still to be found among the Moslems (see Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' 3:364; Lane, 'Modern Egypt,' 1:358; Russell, 'Nat. Hist. of Aleppo;' Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:216), and the latter of which was not altogether unknown among Western nations (cf. Virgil, 'Georg.' lit. 26, etc.), of which traces may still be seen in Switzerland, Germany, and on old houses in both England and Scotland. This custom originated, probably, in a desire to have the sentiments inscribed always in mind; but for the most part these inscriptions came to be regarded as amulets or charms, the presence of which on the person or the house was a safeguard against evil influences, especially such as were supernatural. By the Jews this custom was followed; and they regarded it as authorized by the injunction of Moses in this passage. Taking his words literally, they had their t&ocirc;t&acirc;photh and their mezuzah, the former of which - the phylacteries of the New Testament - were strips of parchment, on which passages of the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2-10, 11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-10, 13-22</a>) were written, and these, enclosed in a box, were bound on the forehead and left wrist, and worn at prayers by the worshippers; the latter a slip of parchment, on which were written certain passages of Scripture (vers. 4-9; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>), and which, enclosed in a reed or cylinder, was fixed on the right-hand doorpost of every room in the house (see arts. 'Mezuzah' and 'Phylacteries' in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' 3rd edit.).

They are, therefore, here warned against the danger to which they would be thus exposed. <span class="cmt_word">House of bondage</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>).

Thus, really believing in God and reverently worshipping him, the Israelites would be careful not to go after other gods, or to give to any object that homage which is due unto Jehovah alone, knowing that this he will not endure or suffer with impunity; for he is a jealous God, and them that thus dishonor him he will destroy (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, etc.). Thus also they should be kept from murmuring against God, and thereby tempting him - putting him, as it were, to the proof, and calling in question his presence and his power, as they had done at Massah (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). Without this genuine religious principle there will be no sincere worship, no true reverence, no real obedience, rendered unto God. But where this dwells in the heart it will influence the whole life, so that the commandments of God shall be diligently kept, and that which is good and right in his sight shall be done.
