The other side of the sea would be the south-east side of the sea. <span class="cmt_word">Into the country of the Gadarenes</span>, or rather, <span class="accented">Gera-senes</span>, which is now generally admitted to be the true reading, from Gerasa, Gersa, or Kersa. There was another Gerasa, situated at some distance from the sea, on the borders of Arabia Petraea. The ruins of the Gerasa, here referred to, have been recently discovered by Dr. Thomson, ('The Land and the Book'). Immediately over  this spot is a lofty mountain, in which are ancient tombs; and from this mountain there is an almost perpendicular declivity, literally (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) corresponding accurately to what is required by the description in the narrative of the miracle. Dr. Farrar ('Life of Christ') says that in the days of Eusebius and Jerome, tradition pointed to a "<span class="accented">steep</span> place" near "<span class="accented">Gerasa"</span> as the scene of the miracle. The foot of this steep is washed by the waters of the lake, which are at once very deep. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-2.htm">Mark 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit</span>. St. Matthew says that there were two. St. Luke, like St. Mark, mentions only one, and him "possessed with devils," The one mentioned by St. Mark was no doubt the more prominent and fierce of the two. This does not mean merely a person with a disordered intellect. No doubt, in this case, as in that of insanity, physical causes may have helped to lay the victim open to such an incursion; and this may account for cases of possession being enumerated with various sicknesses, though distinguished from them. But our Lord evidently deals with these persons, not as persons suffering from insanity, but as the subjects of an alien spiritual power, external to themselves. He addresses the unclean spirit through the man that was possessed, and says," Come forth thou unclean spirit" (Ver. 8). <span class="accented">There met him out of the tombs.</span> The Jews did not have their burial-places in their cities, lest they should be defiled; therefore they buried their dead without the gates in the fields or mountains. Their sepulchres were frequently hewn out of the rock in the sides of the limestone hills, and they were lofty and capacious; so that the living could enter them, as into a vault. So this demoniac dwelt in the tombs, because the unclean spirit drove him thither, where the associations of the place would accord with his malady and aggravate its symptoms. St. Matthew, speaking of the two, says that they were "exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass that way." The demoniac particularly mentioned by St. Mark is described as having been possessed of that extraordinary muscular strength which maniacs so often put forth; so that all efforts to bind and restrain him had proved ineffectual. No man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7b;</span>). Chains and fetters had often been tried, but in vain. Frequently too, in the paroxysms of his malady, he would turn his violence against himself, crying out, and cutting himself with stones<span class="cmt_word">.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-3.htm">Mark 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">Who had <i>his</i> dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</div><div class="comm">

These words, "from afar," explain the fact of our Lord being immediately met by the man as soon as he left the boat. Vers. 3-5 inclusive must be regarded as parenthetical. They describe the ordinary condition of the demoniac, and his sad wild life from day to day. From the high ground which he frequented he had seen the boat, in which Jesus was, nearing the shore. He had seen the other boats. Perhaps he had seen the sudden rise of the storm and its equally sudden suppression; and he, like others who witnessed it, was affected by it. So he hastened to the shore; <span class="cmt_word">he ran and worshipped him</span>. He felt the power of his presence, and so he was constrained through fear to do him reverence, for "the devils also believe and shudder (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cried with a loud voice</span>; that is, the evil spirit cried out, using the organs of the man whom he possessed. <span class="cmt_word">What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God?</span> From hence it appears that, although at the great temptation of our Lord in the wilderness, Satan had but an imperfect knowledge of him: yet now, after the evidence of these great miracles, and more especially of his power over the evil spirits, there was a general belief amongst the hosts of evil that he was indeed the Son of God, the Messiah. I adjure thee by God, torment me not. The torment which he dreaded was that which he might suffer after expulsion. So St. Luke says that they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. Great as this mystery of evil is, we may believe that the evil spirits, although while they roam about upon this earth they are in misery, still it is some alleviation that they are not yet shut up in the prison-house of hell, but are suffered to wander about and their depraved pleasure in tempting men; so that, if possible, they may at last drag them down with them into the abyss. For they are full of hatred of God and envy of man; and they find a miserable satisfaction in endeavoring to keep men out of those heavenly mansions from which, through pride, they are themselves now for ever excluded. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">For he said unto him, Come out of the man, <i>thou</i> unclean spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for he was saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>). The unclean spirit endeavored to arrest, before it was spoken, that word of power which he knew he must obey. So in what follows, <span class="cmt_word">He was asking him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">What is thy name?</span> Why does our Lord ask this question? Clearly to elicit from him an answer that would reveal the multitude of the evil spirits, and so make his own power over them to be fully known. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many</span>. The Roman legion consisted of six  thousand soldiers. But the word is here used indefinitely for a large number. St. Luke so explains it where he says (<a href="../../par/luke/8-30.htm">Luke 8:30</a>), "And he said, Legion: for many devils were entered into him." This revelation is doubtless designed to teach us how great is the number as well as the malignity of the evil spirits. If one human being can be possessed by so many, how vast must be the host of those who are permitted to have access to the souls of men, and if possible lead them to destruction! Satan here imitates him who is "The Lord of hosts." He too marshals his hosts, that he may fight against God and his people. But "for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he asked him, What <i>is</i> thy name? And he answered, saying, My name <i>is</i> Legion: for we are many.</div><div class="comm">

It would appear as though this evil spirit felt (speaking in the name of the other evil spirits) that if they were driven out from their present dwelling-places, their condition would be changed for the worse; and that until the time should come when they were to be cast into the abyss, their best relief was to possess some materialism, to occupy flesh and blood, and that flesh and blood tenanted by a spiritual being, through whom they might torment others. They could find no rest, no relief, but in this. "The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>). Even the swine were better than nothing; but that dwelling did not serve the evil spirits long. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-11.htm">Mark 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was there nigh unto the mountains</span> - literally, <span class="accented">on the mountain side</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">a great herd of swine feeding</span>. St. Matthew says (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-30.htm">Matthew 8:30</a>), "There was a good way off from them:" our Lord's interview with the demoniac was on the seashore. "The herd of swine," two thousand in number (as St. Mark tells us, with his usual attention to details), were at a distance, feeding on the slopes of the mountain; The Jews were not allowed to eat swine's flesh. But Jews were not the only inhabitants of that district. It had been colonized, at least in part, by the Romans immediately after the conquest of Syria, some sixty years before Christ. It was in this district that ten cities are said to have been rebuilt by the Romans, whence the territory acquired the name of "the Decapolis." And though the Jews were forbidden their Law to eat this kind of food, yet they were not forbidden to breed swine for other uses, such as provisioning the Roman army. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-12.htm">Mark 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And he gave them leave</span>. They could not enter even into the swine without Christ's permission; how much less into "the sheep of his pasture"! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-13.htm">Mark 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently</span> <span class="cmt_word">down a steep place</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">down the steep</span> - <span class="cmt_word">into the sea,... and were choked in the sea</span>. By this Christ shows of how little worth are earthly possessions when set in the balance with the souls of men. The recovery of this demoniac was worth far more than the value of the two thousand swine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-14.htm">Mark 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">And they that fed the swine fled, and told <i>it</i> in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country</span>. St. Matthew mentions only the city. St. Mark's narrative is more full. No doubt many of these swineherds lived in the country districts; and so the fame of the miracle was spread far and wide. The swineherds would take care that the owners should understand that it was through no fault or carelessness on their part that the swine had perished; but that the destruction was caused by a power over which they had no control. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the owners - <span class="cmt_word">came to see what it was that had come to pass</span>. Their first care was to see the extent of their loss; and this was soon revealed to them. They must have seen the carcases of the swine floating hither and thither in the now calm and tranquil sea; and when they had thus satisfied themselves as to the facts, "they came to Jesus." St. Mark here uses the historic present, "they come to Jesus," that they might behold him of whom these great things were told, as well as the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone when they entered into the swine. They were, of course, concerned to know the magnitude of their loss, and the mode in which it had happened, that they might see whether there were any means by which it might be made up to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-15.htm">Mark 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with devils sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion; and they were afraid</span>. St, Luke adds that they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus. It is likely enough that the man, as soon as he found himself dispossessed, had east himself at the feet of Jesus, and was worshipping him; but that, when hidden by Christ to sit, he chose to place himself at his feet. "He was clothed, and in his right mind." What a contrast to the previous description! "And they were afraid." They dreaded Christ's power. They saw that he was almighty; but they did not seek to know his love, and so to attain to that love which "casteth out fear." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-16.htm">Mark 5:16</a></div><div class="verse">And they that saw <i>it</i> told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and <i>also</i> concerning the swine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How it befell him that was pessessed with devils, and concerning the swine</span>. The loss of the swine. They   could not get over that. They thought far more of the worldly loss than of the spiritual gain; <span class="cmt_word">and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders</span>. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>) says that "they were taken (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) [literally, were <span class="accented">holden</span>] with great fear." This was the dominant feeling. They did not entreat him to depart out of humility, as though they felt themselves unworthy of his presence; but out of servile, slavish fear, lest his continued presence among them might bring upon them still greater losses. They saw that Jesus, a Jew according to the flesh, was holy, powerful, Divine. But they knew that they were Gentiles, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Wherefore they feared lest he should punish them more grievously, both on account of their being Gentiles and on account of their past sins. It was not, therefore, so much on account of hatred, as out of a timorous fear, that they besought Jesus that he would depart out of their borders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-17.htm">Mark 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</div><div class="comm">

It was natural that he should desire this. It would be grateful and soothing to him to be near to Christ, from whom he had received so great a benefit and yet hoped for more. <span class="cmt_word">And he suffered him not, but saith unto him; Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee.</span> Our Lord here takes a different course from what lie so often took. He saw, no doubt, that this restored demoniac was fitted for missionary work; and there was no reason to apprehend any inconvenience to himself in consequence from a people who wished to get rid of him. <span class="cmt_word">And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis</span> - in Decapolis, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the whole district of the ten cities - <span class="cmt_word">how great things Jesus had done for him</span>. This would bring him into contact alike with Gentiles and with Jews; and so this dispossessed demoniac became a missionary to both Jew and Gentile. Here he planted the standard of the cross. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</div><div class="comm">

St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>) distinctly tells us that he had left Nazareth, and was now dwelling at Capernaum, thus fulfilling the ancient prophecy with regard to Zebulun and Nephthalim. The circumstances under which he quitted Nazareth are given by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-31</a>). St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>) calls Capernaum his own city. Thus as Christ ennobled Bethlehem by his birth, Nazareth by his education, and Jerusalem By his death, so he honored Capernaum by making it his ordinary residence, and the focus, so to speak, of his preaching and miracles. When Jesus returned, <span class="cmt_word">a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea</span>. St. Luke says that the people welcomed him, for they were waiting for him. Again he placed himself by the sea, probably for the conveniences of addressing a multitude, and of relieving himself of the pressure, as before, by taking refuge in a boat.

Observe here the promptitude of Christ to assist the afflicted. St. Chrysostom suggests that our Lord purposely interposed some delay, by healing, as he went, the woman with the issue of blood, in order that the actual death of the daughter of Jairus might take place; and that so there might be full demonstration of his resurrection power.

All the synoptic Gospels mention the length of time during which she had been suffering. Eusebius records a tradition that she was a Gentile, a native of Caesarea Philippi. This disease was a chronic hoemorrhage, for which she had found no relief from the physicians. Lightfoot, in his 'Horae Hebraicae,' gives a list of the remedies applied in such cases, which seem quite sufficient to account for St. Mark's statement that <span class="cmt_word">she was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse</span>.

St. Matthew tells us that "she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." From this it appears that, though she had faith, it was an imperfect faith. She seems to have imagined that a certain magical influence was within Christ and around him. And the touching of the border of his garment (the blue fringe which the Jews were required to wear, to remind them that they were God's people) was supposed by her to convey a special virtue. Yet her faith, though imperfect, was true in its essence, and therefore was not disappointed.

This incident shows the mysterious connection between the spiritual and the physical. The miraculous virtue or power which went forth from the Saviour was spiritual in its source and in the conditions on which it was imparted, but it was physical in its operation; and that which brought the two together was faith. Multitudes thronged the Saviour, but only one of the crowd <span class="accented">touched</span> him.

It was her own act. She seemed to herself as though without permission she had stolen a blessing from Christ; and so she could hardly venture to hope that the faith which had prompted her would be accepted. Hence her fear and terror, and her free and full confession. We thus see the <span class="accented">gentleness</span> of Christ in his dealings with us. Perhaps the woman had intended to escape, satisfied with a temporal benefit, which would hardly have been a blessing at all, if she had been suffered to carry it away without acknowledgment. But this her loving Saviour would not permit her to do. It was the crisis of her spiritual life. It was necessary that all around should know of the gift which she had endeavored to snatch in secret. Our Lord might have demanded from her this public confession of her faith beforehand. But, in his mercy, he made the way easy to her. The lesson, however, must not be forgotten, that it is not enough to believe with the heart. The lips must do their part, and "with the mouth confession must be made unto salvation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Our Lord here reassures this trembling woman, who feared, it may be, lest, because she had abstracted the blessing secretly, he might punish her with a return of her malady. On the contrary, he confirms the benefit, and bids her be whole of her plague. The Greek expression here is stronger than that which is given as the rendering of what she had used when we read that she said within herself, "I shall be saved (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." Here our Lord says, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Go in peace, and be whole</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>). It is as though he said, "It is not the mere fringe of my garment, which you have touched with great faith, and with some hope of obtaining a cure - it is not this that has cured you. You owe your healing to my omnipotence and your faith. Your faith (itself my gift) has delivered you from your issue of blood; and this deliverance I now confirm and ratify. 'Go in peace.'" The original Greek here (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) implies more than this. It means "Go for peace." Pass into the realm, the element of peace, in which henceforth thy life shall move. It is here obvious to remark that this malady represents to us the ever-flowing bitter fountain of sin, for which no styptic treatment can be found in human philosophy. The remedy is only to be found in Christ. To touch Christ's garment is to believe in his incarnation, whereby he has touched us, and so has enabled us by faith to touch him, and to receive his blessing of peace.

The ruler must have been agonized with the thought that, while our Lord lingered, the life of his dying child was fast ebbing away.  And now comes the fatal message to him. Thy daughter is dead (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>); the aorist expresses that her death was now a past event. <span class="cmt_word">Why troublest thou the Master any further?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

Here the word can only have th<span class="accented">e</span> meaning of "not heeding," or " refusing to hear." This seems to be a strong reason for giving the word a somewhat similar meaning in this passage. And therefore, on the whole, "not heeding" seems to be the best rendering. Indeed, it seems to cover both meanings. Our Lord would overhear, and yet not heed, the word spoken.
