Nazareth would be about a day's journey from Capernaum. This was not the first public exercise of his ministry at Nazareth. Of that and its results St. Luke gives us the account (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>). It would seem reasonable to suppose that, after the fame which he had now acquired, he should again visit the place where he had been brought up. His sisters were still living there. St. Mark here again uses the historical present <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "he cometh," for which there is better authority than for <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">His disciples follow him</span>.

And they were offended at him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not this</span> <span class="cmt_word">the carpenter?</span> St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>) says, "the carpenter's son." We infer from this that our Lord actually worked at the trade of a carpenter, and probably continued to do so until he entered upon his public ministry. We may also infer that Joseph was now no longer living, otherwise it would have been natural for his name to have been mentioned here. According to St. Chrysostom, our Lord made ploughs and yokes for oxen. Certain]y, he often drew his similitudes from these things. "No man putting his hand to the <span class="accented">plough</span>, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (<a href="../../par/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>). "Take my <span class="accented">yoke</span> upon you, and learn of me "(<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>). Christ was the son of a carpenter. Yes; but he was also the Son of him who made the world at his will. Yea, he himself made the world. "All things were made by him," the Eternal Word. And he made them for us, that we might judge of the Maker by the greatness of his work. He chose to be the son of a carpenter. If he had chosen to be the sou of an emperor, then men might have ascribed his influence to the circumstances of his birth. But he chose a humble and obscure condition, for this, among other reasons, that it might be acknowledged that it was his divinity that transformed the world. Is not this the carpenter, the son of <span class="cmt_word">Mary</span>,  <span class="cmt_word">and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon?</span> Some have thought that these were literally brethren of our Lord, sons of Joseph and Mary. Others have considered that they were his legal half-brothers, sons of Joseph by a former marriage. This view is held by many of the Greek Fathers, and has something to recommend it. But, on the whole, the most probable opinion is that they were cousins of our Lord - sons of a sister of the Virgin Mary, also called Mary, the wife of Cleophas, Clopas, or Alpheeus. There is evidence that there were four sons of Clopas and Mary, whose names were James, and Joses, and Simon (or Symeon), and Judas. Mary the wife of Clopas is mentioned by St. Matthew (Matthew 27:56) as the mother of James the less and of Joses. Jude describes himself (<a href="../../par/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>) as the brother of James; and Simon, or Symeon, is mentioned in Eusebius as the son of Clopas. It must be remembered also that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew word which it expresses, means not only "a brother," but generally "a near kinsman." In the same way the "sisters" would be cousins of our Lord. According to a tradition recorded by Nicephorus (2:3), the names of these sisters or cousins were Esther and Tamar. <span class="cmt_word">And they were offended in him</span>. They took it ill that one brought up amongst them as a car<span class="accented">penter</span> should set himself up as a prophet and a teacher; just as there are those in every age who are apt to take it amiss if they see any one spring from a trade into the doctor's chair. But these Nazarencs <span class="accented">knew</span> not that Jesus was the Son of God, who of his great love for man vouchsafed to take a low estate, that he might redeem us, and teach us humility by his example. And thus this humility and love of Christ, which ought to have excited their admiration and respect, was a stumbling-block to them, because they could not receive it, or believe that God was willing thus to humble himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country</span>, etc. One reason for this is that it is almost natural for persons to hold of less account than <span class="accented">they</span> ought, those with whom they have been brought up and have lived on familiar terms. Prophets are commonly least regarded, and often most envied, in their own country. However unworthy may be the feeling, the inhabitants of a district, or members of a community, do not like to see one of themselves put above them, more especially a junior over a senior, or a man of humble origin over a man well born. But it should be remembered that God abhors the envious, and will withhold the wonders of his grace from those who grudge his gifts to others. The men of Nazareth, when they saw Christ eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and working at his trade, like others, despised him when he claimed respect and reverence as a Prophet, and especially because his relations according to the flesh were of humble condition; and Joseph more particularly, whom they supposed to be his real father, for they could not imagine or believe that he was born of a virgin, and had God alone for his Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he could there do no mighty work</span>. This is a remarkable expression. <span class="accented">He could do no mighty work there.</span> The words imply want of power - that in some sense or other he was unable to do it. He did indeed perform some miracles. He laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them; but he wrought none of his greater miracles there. Of course, even these less striking miracles ought to have sufficed. in a miracle there must be the suspension of some known law of nature; and one clear instance of such suspension ought to be as conclusive as a hundred. Then it must be remembered that it is not God's method in his dealings with his creatures to force conviction upon them when the ordinary means prove insufficient. For men's actions must be free if they are to be made the test of judgment, and they would not be free if God constrained men to obey his will. The men of Nazareth had sufficient evidence had they not chosen to be blinded, and a greater amount of evidence would only have increased their condemnation. So their unbelief thwarted his purposes of mercy, and he went in and out amongst them like one hampered and disabled, marvelling at their unbelief, or rather <span class="cmt_word">marveling because of their unbelief</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). The condition of mind of these Nazarenes was what caused amazement to the Saviour. At length he turned away from Nazareth, never, so far as we know, to visit it again; for this was their second opportunity, and the second occasion which they deliberately rejected him. What, however, they refused he immediately offered to others. He was not discouraged<span class="cmt_word">. He went round about the villages teaching.</span>

St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>) adds, "and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/6-8.htm">Mark 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">And commanded them that they should take nothing for <i>their</i> journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in <i>their</i> purse:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only</span>. St. Matthew says (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a>), according to the best authorities (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), they were not to take a staff. St. Luke says the same as St. Matthew. The meaning is that they were not to make any special provision for their journey, but to go forth just as they were, depending upon God. Those who bad a staff might use it; those who had not one were not to trouble themselves to procure one. The scrip (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) was the wallet for food. <span class="cmt_word">They were to take no money in their purse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">brass in their girdle.</span> St. Mark, writing for Romans, uses this word for money.

St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-9.htm">Matthew 10:9</a>) says, "provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass."

According to St. Matthew, shoes are forbidden directly; according to St. Mark, they are forbidden by implication, where he says that they were to be shod with sandals. Shoes are here forbidden which cover the whole foot, not sandals which only protect the soles of the feet lest they should be injured by the rocky ground. The soil of Judaea was rocky and rough, and the climate hot. The sandals therefore protected the soles of the feet, and yet, being open above, kept the feet more cool, and therefore fit for the journey. It is worthy of our notice that, after our Lord's ascension, we find St. Peter using sandals when the angel, who delivered him out of prison, said to him (<a href="../../par/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>), "Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals."

A very significant action. The dust was shaken off as an evidence of the toil and labour of the apostles in journeying to them. It witnessed that they had entered the city and had delivered message, and that their message had been refused. The very dust, therefore, of the place was a defilement to them. "It shall be more tolerable," etc. This clause is omitted by the best authorities; it was probably copied from St. Matthew.

It is hardly possible to separate this from the reference to the use of oil for the sick, in <a href="../../par/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>. Unction was employed extensively in ancient times for medicinal purposes. It is recorded of Herod the Great by Josephus ('Antiq.,' 17:6, 5) that in one of his sicknesses he was "immersed in a bath full of oil," from which he is said to have derived much benefit. The apostles used it, no doubt not only on account of its supposed remedial virtues, but also as an outward and visible sign that the healing was effected by their instrumentality in the name of Christ, and perhaps also because the oil itself was significant of God's mercy, of spiritual comfort and joy" the oil of gladness." Neither this passage nor that in St. James can properly be adduced to support the ceremony of "extreme unction;" for in both these cases the result was that the sick were restored to health. The so-called sacrament of" extreme unction "is administered immediately before death, when the sick person is <span class="accented">in articulo morris.</span>

The word "tetrarch" properly means the sovereign or ruler of the fourth part of a territory. He is known as Herod Anti-pus, son of Herod the Great, who had appointed him "tetrarch" of Galilee and Peraea. Herod Antipas had married the daughter of Arctas, King of Arabia, but deserted her for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. <span class="cmt_word">John the Baptist is risen from the dead</span>; that is, "is risen in the person of Jesus Christ." St. Luke. (<a href="../../par/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>) says that at first Herod was "much perplexed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)" "about him. At length, however, as he heard more and more of the fame of Christ's miracles, he came to the conclusion that our Lord was none other than John the Baptist risen again. Such is the opinion of St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and others. At that time the views of Pythagoras respecting the transmigration of souls were generally current, and probably influenced the troubled mind of Herod. He had put to death an innocent and holy man; and it is a high testimony to the worth of the Baptist that, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, Herod should have come to the conclusion that he had risen from the dead, thus probably giving the lie to his own opinions as a Sadducee; and terrified lest the Baptist should now  avenge his own murder. "What a great thing," exclaims St. Chrysostom," is virtue! for Herod fears him, even though dead." It should not be forgotten that this is the same Herod who set Jesus at nought and mocked him, when Pilate sent him to him, in the hope of relieving himself of the terrible responsibility of condemning one whom he knew to be innocent.

Here St. Mark says <span class="cmt_word">that Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; for Herod feared John</span>. There is no contradiction between the two evangelists. The case appears to have been this: that at first Herod desired to put John to death, because John had reproved him on account of Herodias.

Nor is there any inconsistency in the next clause in St. Mark, if we accept this reading. Herod was not utterly depraved. There was to him a charm, not only in the character, but in the discourses of John the Baptist. But he was an inconsistent man, and was continually the victim of a conflict between the good and the evil within him, in which evil, alas! triumphed. Herodias, on the other hand, had always wished to get rid of John, as the stern and uncompromising reprover of her adultery and incest; and so at length she persuaded Herod to give way.

We cannot suppose that this was a pretended grief. The true reason is doubtless to be found in the relentless animosity of Herodias.

St. Augustine says, "The girl dances; the mother rages.

Because they could not bear to hear the truth, therefore they bored through with a bodkin the tongue that had spoken the truth.

Josephus says that after the beheading, the mutilated remains were east out of the prison and left neglected. God's judgments at length found out Herod. For not long after this he was defeated by Aretas in a great battle, and put to an ignominious flight. Herodias herself and Herod were banished by a decree of the Roman Senate to Lyons, where they both perished miserably; and Nicephorus relates that Salome, the daughter of Herodias, died by a remarkable visitation. She fell  through some treacherous ice over which she was passing, and fell through it in such a manner that her head was caught while the rest of her body sank into the water, and thus it came to pass that in her efforts to save herself her head was nearly severed by the sharp edges of the broken ice.

The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> appears in the Sinaitic Manuscript and in the Cambridge Codex. <span class="cmt_word">His disciples came unto him, and said</span>.

Thus our Lord prepared the way for his miracle, he detained the multitude till the day was far spent, so that the disciples might be induced to pray him to dismiss them. This would open the way for him to direct the disciples to feed them. And thus the miracle would appear all the more evident in proportion as they found themselves in a strait, and utterly destitute of the needful supplies of food for such a multitude in the desert. St. John's account here is much more full. He tells us (<a href="../../par/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>) that Jesus, addressing Philip, said, "Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?" And he adds, "This he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do." Our Lord, it would seem, asked Philip rather than the others, because Philip was simple-minded, sincere, and teachable, rather than clever, and so was accustomed to ask things which appeared plain to others. We have an instance of this simplicity of mind in the question which he asks (<a href="../../par/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a>), "Lord show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."

The penny, or "denarius," was the chief Roman silver coin, worth about eight-pence halfpenny. Upon the breaking up of the Roman empire, the states which arose upon its ruins imitated the coinage of the old imperial mints, and in general called their principal silver coin the "denarius." Thus the denarius found its way into this country through the Anglo-Saxons, and it was for a long period the only coin. Hence the introduction of the word into the Authorized Version. Two hundred pennyworth would be of the value of nearly seven pounds. But considering the constant fluctuation in the relation between money and the commodities purchased by money, it is in vain to require what number of loaves the same two hundred denarii would purchase at that time, although it was evidently the representation of a large supply of bread.

St. John tells us (<a href="../../par/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>) that the loaves were of barley, and that the fishes were small (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>); St. Mark says <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Barley bread was considered an inferior and homely kind of food, very inferior to bread made of wheat flour. The comparative  value of the two kinds of bread is given in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>. "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny."

St. John says (<a href="../../par/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>) that "there was much grass in the place." This indicates the time of the year. The grass was growing, and it was green. It would not be green in that district after April. Thus St. Mark's account of the state of the grass at that time (an account evidently repeated from an eye-witness) coincides with the account of St. John, who says that "the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand" (<a href="../../par/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>).

Probably the English word "ranks" expresses the meaning as clearly as any could do. This arrangement was probably made, partly that the numbers might be better known, partly that all things might be done in an orderly manner, and that each might have his portion. St. Matthew's account (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>) seems to imply that the "men" were separated from the "women and children." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave <i>them</i> to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - All the synoptists give our Lord's acts in the same words. The taking of the food into the hands would seem to have been a formal act before the" blessing," or "giving of thanks," for it. Probably our Lord used the ordinary form of benediction. This is one amongst other instances showing the fitness and propriety of" grace before meat." In considering the miraculous action which followed the benediction, our reason is baffled. It eludes our grasp. It is best simply to behold in this multiplying of the food, both the bread and the fishes, an act of Divine omnipotence; not indeed now, as at the beginning, a creation out of nothing, for here there was the nucleus of the five loaves and the two fishes, but an act of creative development of the food in its best kind; for all the works of God are perfect, <span class="cmt_word">He gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) would be better rendered, <span class="accented">he was giving.</span> It was in his hands that the miracle was wrought, and the food continually multiplied.

It is probable that the women and children were a considerable number; for they would be, if possible, even more eager then the men to see the great Prophet.

It does not become us to pry too curiously into the method of our Lord's working; but the number of these baskets (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), namely, twelve, seems to suggest that he first broke the loaves, and in breaking multiplied them, and distributed them into these baskets, one for each apostle, and that the food, as it was distributed by the disciples, was more and more multiplied, as needed, so that at length they brought back to Christ as many basketfuls of fragments as they had first received from him, and much more than the original supply. It is obvious here to remark that by this stupendous miracle our Lord showed himself to be the true Bread of life, by which the spiritual wants of all hungering souls may be supplied. "For," says St. Augustine," he was the Word of God, and all the acts of the Word are themselves words for us. They are not as pictures, merely, to look at and admire; but as letters which we must seek to read and understand."

Again and again our Lord crossed this sea to escape the crowds who followed him about, and now wished "to take him by force and make him a king." He desired for a time to be in retirement, in order that he might pray with the greater earnestness, and freedom from interruption.

To pray (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). This is a very full word, implying the outpouring of the heart to God. Our Lord did this that he might teach us in our prayers to shun the crowd, and to pray in silence and in secret, with collected mind. There is here, too, a special example for the clergy, namely, this: that when they have preached they should go apart and pray that God would make effectual that which they have delivered; that he would himself give the increase where they have planted and watered, and renew their spiritual strength, that they may return again to their labour refreshed by communion with him.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> means more than "toiling;" it means literally, <span class="accented">tormented.</span> It is well rendered in the Revised Version by <span class="accented">distressed</span>. It was only by painful effort that they could make head against the driving storm blowing upon them from the west, that is, from the Mediterranean Sea. <span class="cmt_word">About the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea</span>. The Jews formerly divided the night into three watches; but when Judaea became a Roman province they adopted the Roman division. The Romans changed the watches every three hours, lest through too long watches the guards might slumber at their posts. These periods were called "watches." If the night was short, they divided it into three watches; if long, into four. Therefore the fourth watch began at the tenth hour of the night, that is, at three o'clock in the morning, and continued to the twelfth, that is, to six o'clock. It would seem, therefore, that this storm lasted for nine hours. During that time the disciples had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, that is about three Roman miles - eight furlongs - making a mile. The Sea of Galilee is not more than six miles broad at its widest part. They were therefore now (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) "in the midst of the sea," as St. Mark expresses it; so that, after rowing for nine hours, they had hardly crossed more than half over the sea. The Sea of Galilee is, speaking roughly, about twelve miles from north to south and six from east to west. It may be asked why our Lord suffered them to be tempest-tossed so long; and the answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It was a trial of their faith, so as to urge them to seek more earnestly the help of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It was a lesson to accustom them to endure bard-ness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It made the stilling of so tedious and dangerous a storm all the more grateful and welcome to them at last. The Fathers find a fine spiritual meaning in this. Jerome says, "The fourth watch is the <span class="accented">last."</span> So, too, St. Augustine, who adds that "he who has watched the ship of his Church will come at length at the fourth watch, at the end of the world, when the night of sin and evil is ended, to judge the quick and the dead." Theophylact says, "He allows his disciples to be tried by dangers, that they may be taught patience, and does not come to them till morning, that they may learn perseverance and faith." Hilary says, "The <span class="accented">first</span> watch was the age of the Law, the <span class="accented">second</span> of the prophets, the <span class="accented">third</span> of the gospel, the <span class="accented">fourth</span> of his glorious advent, when he will find her buffeted by the spirit of antichrist and by the storms of the world. And by his reception into the ship and the consequent calm is prefigured the eternal peace of the Church after his second coming" (see Wordsworth's 'New Testament:'St. <a href="../../par/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14</a>). <span class="accented">He walked on the sea</span>. This he did by his Divine power, which he possessed as God, and which, when he pleased, he could assume as man. Infidelity is at fault here. Paulus the rationalist, revived the ridiculous idea that Christ walking on the sea merely meant Christ walking on the shore, elevated above the sea; but the interpretation was rightly denounced by Lavater as "a laughable insult on logic, hermeneutics, good sense, and honesty." Was it because our Lord simply walked on the shore that the disciples "cried out and were troubled"? Was it merely for this that they were "sore amazed at themselves beyond measure and wondered"? Yet such are the shifts to which unbelief is reduced when it ventures to measure itself against the acts of Omnipotence. <span class="cmt_word">He would have passed</span> <span class="cmt_word">by them.</span> An expression something like that in St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/24-28.htm">Luke 24:28</a>), "He made as though he would go further," although there the Greek in St. Luke is different (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Here it is <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">he wished to pass by them</span>;  so at least it appeared to the disciples. It has been suggested that our Lord did this that the disciples might more clearly see how the wind was stilled in his presence. <span class="cmt_word">They supposed that it was an apparition</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a phantom.</span> Why did they suppose this? Partly from the idea that spectres appear in the night and in the darkness to terrify men, and partly because in the darkness they could not so readily recognize that it was Jesus. Then the fact that our Lord" would bare passed by them," flitting past them as though he eared nothing for them and had nothing to do with them, but was going elsewhere; this must have increased their terror. But now came the moment for him to calm their fears. Straightway he talked with them soothingly. <span class="cmt_word">Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid</span>. Now, Christ did this that he might teach his disciples to conquer fear and temptation, even when they are very great, and that so the deliverance and the consolation might impress them all the more powerfully and sweetly in proportion to their former terror. "'It is I' - I, your Lord and Master, whom you know so well, and of whose goodness and omnipotence you have already had so much experience; I, your Master, who do not come to mock you as a phantom, but to deliver you both from fear and from storm." It will be observed that St. Mark omits all mention of Peter's act of faith "in going down from the boat, and walking upon the waters to come to Jesus," as recorded by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28</a>). Throughout this Gospel, as already noticed, St. Peter is kept in the background.
