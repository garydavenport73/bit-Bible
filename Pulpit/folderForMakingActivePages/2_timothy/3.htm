"Grievous" is not a very good rendering. "Perilous," though in some contexts it is a right rendering, is a little too restricted here.

If <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the right reading, it must refer either to God or to St. Paul. In favour of its referring to God is the expression in the Prophet Isaiah commented upon by our Lord in <a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> answers to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the promise concerning the Comforter, "He shall teach you all things" (<a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, etc.); and the very similar reasoning of St. John, when he is exhorting his "little children" to stand fast in the faith, in spite of those that seduced them: "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning;" for "the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,...and even as it hath taught yon, abide in him" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24-28</a>); and other similar passages. There would obviously be great force in reminding Timothy that he had received the gospel under the immediate teaching of the Holy Spirit, and that it would be a shameful thing for him to turn aside under the influence of those impostors. If <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to God, it must refer to St. Paul. If, on the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is the true reading (which is less probable), it must refer to Lois and Eunice, which seems rather feeble.

But as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is invariably used in the New Testament for "Scripture," and not for any profane writing: it is not in accordance with biblical language to say, "every inspired Scripture," because every <span class="accented">Scripture</span> is inspired. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sentence, taken according to (B), is an extremely awkward, and, as Alford admits. harsh construction, net supported in its entirety by one single parallel usage in the whole New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The sentence, taken according to (A), is a perfectly simple one, and is exactly parallel with <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is in perfect harmony with the context.

They are inspired of God, and hence their wide use and great power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> This interpretation is supported by high authority: Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, etc., among the ancients (Alford); and Bengel, Wiesinger, De Wette, etc., among modern. The advocates of (B), as Bishop Ellicott, Dean Alford, etc., speak very doubtfully. With regard to the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, no doubt, strict grammar, in the absence of the article, favours the rendering in the R.V., "every Scripture," rather than that of the A.V., "all Scripture." But Alford's remark on <a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a> applies with full force here: "When a word or an expression came to bear a technical conventional meaning, it was also common to use it without the article, as if it were a proper name, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>," etc. Therefore, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>) means "all Jerusalem," not "every Jerusalem," so here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "all  Scripture." What follows of the various uses of Holy Scripture is not true of "every Scripture." One Scripture is profitable for doctrine, another for reproof, and so on. Examples of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> without the article are <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/1-2.htm">Romans 1:2</a>; and of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> not followed by the article, and yet meaning "all," are in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a> and Ephesians 3:15. <span class="cmt_word">Inspired of God,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament or LXX., but occasionally in classical Greek, as Plutarch. <span class="cmt_word">For teaching</span>, etc. The particular uses for which Scripture is said to be profitable present no difficulty. Teaching, of which Holy Scripture is the only infallible source. <span class="cmt_word">Reproof</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>; but in classical Greek it means "a proof," specially for the purpose of "refutation" of a false statement or argument. Here in the same sense for the "conviction" or "refutation" of false teachers (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9, 13</a>), but probably including errors in living (compare in the 'Ordering of Priests,' "That there be no place left among you, either for error in religion or for viciousness in life"). <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but occasionally in the LXX., and frequently in classical Greek, as Aristotle, Plato, etc., in the sense of "correction," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting a person or thing straight, "revisal," "improvement," "amendment," or the like. It may be applied equally to opinions and to morals, or way of life. <span class="cmt_word">Instruction which is in righteousness.</span> There is no advantage in this awkward phraseology. "Instruction in righteousness" exactly expresses the meaning.

By the use of Holy Scripture the Christian is being continually more perfectly instructed in holy living.
