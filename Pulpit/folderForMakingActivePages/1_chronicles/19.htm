It is possible that this may be the Nahash of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1, 2</a> and 1 Sam 12:12, who, being signally defeated by Saul, may have been the more inclined to show partiality to David. But it would appear that nearly sixty years had elapsed, and if so, it must be held very unlikely, and would point to the conclusion that it was his son whose death is here in question. With this the statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 6:05, &sect; 3), would tally, which says that the Nahash of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>. was killed in the destruction of the Ammonite army then wrought by Saul. Possibly the word "Nahash" was the official title of kings of the Ammonites (and, though considering its signification, <span class="accented">i.e. serpent</span>, scarcely a flattering one from a modern point of view, yet this is overruled by the association of the attribute of <span class="accented">wisdom</span> with the serpent in olden time, of which we have more than a trace in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), as "Pharaoh" of kings of Egypt, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-2.htm">1 Chronicles 19:2</a></div><div class="verse">And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because his father showed kindness to me</span>. The instance of kindness here alluded to is not recorded. There may have been many opportunities and calls for it during David's persecuted life, and when the Ammonite king would feel a motive beyond any intrinsic goodness of heart to "show kindness" to the youth who was Saul's object of hatred. It is, however, very remarkable that we find a genuine kindliness towards David still cleaving to the succession of Ammonite kings, even after the events of this chapter (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>). Hanna. Nothing else is known of this <span class="cmt_word">Hanun</span>. Though here the name of an Ammonite king, we find it in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-13.htm">Nehemiah 3:13, 30</a>, the name of two of those who helped repair the city. The <span class="accented">Assyrian Inscriptions</span> contain the name as that of a Philistine king, tributary to Tiglath-pileser (see 'Speaker's Commentary'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-3.htm">1 Chronicles 19:3</a></div><div class="verse">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thinkest thou that David</span>, etc.? The Hebrew is, "In thine eyes doth David?" The order of <span class="cmt_word">to overthrow, and to spy out</span> is reversed in Samuel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-4.htm">1 Chronicles 19:4</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The classical scholar will not fail to be reminded, so far as the <span class="cmt_word">shaving</span> here spoken of is concerned, of the account contained in Herodotus, 2:121. The parallel place makes the resemblance close, in that it tells us that "one-half of their beards" was shaved. To shave them was an affront to their customs, dignity, and religion: to shave them half added mockery; and to cut off half their garments completed the tale of ignominious and contemptuous insult (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>). The beard was held almost in reverence by Easterns.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Made themselves odious</span>. The Hebrew root of very strong force, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, is here employed, and which our Authorized Version translates, both in the parallel place and elsewhere, far more uncompromisingly than here. <span class="cmt_word">A thousand talents</span>. Not stated in Samuel. This talent was of three thousand shekels, believed to be equivalent to f 342. Mesopotamia. The parallel place has Aram-beth-rehob, instead of our <span class="accented">Aram-naharaim</span> ("Syria of the Two Rivers," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Tigris and Euphrates; Authorized Version, "<span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia"</span>). From comparing this verso with ver. 16, it may seem probable that those strictly called "<span class="accented">of Mesopotamia"</span> lent either no aid at first or but very partial. It is observable that the numbers of men supplied by Beth-rehob, Zobah, and Ishtob in the parallel place (viz. <span class="accented">thirty-two thousand</span>) agree with the numbers of this verse, from which we may conclude that, whatever Aram-beth-rehob (probably either Reho-both on the Euphrates, or Rehob last of Lebanon) and Aram-naharaim may <span class="accented">strictly</span> stand for respectively, they here substantially mean the same. It is possible that the difference is that of a corrupt text or careless copying. The Aram-naharaim (<span class="accented">Mesopotamia</span>), which comes before us first in <a href="../../par/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>, passes out of Scripture language after the defeats of this chapter - the tract of country which it designated (some seven hundred miles by twenty to two hundred and fifty) being absorbed, first by Assyria, and afterwards by Babylon. The <span class="accented">Assyrian Inscriptions</span> reveal the fact that Mesopotamia was the prey of a largo number of small separate tribes at the period of the judges and the early Jewish monarchy, which is quite consistent with the glimpses we here get of it and its people<span class="cmt_word">. Aram-maachah</span> probably designates the tract of country north of East Manasseh, bordering on Palestine, and bounded by the Jordan, Mount Hermon, and on its east, Salcah. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, note; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>). The parallel place adds also "the men of Ishtob." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a></div><div class="verse">So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty and two thousand chariots</span>. The reading in the parallel place is evidently what is intended (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a> with its parallel, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>). Clearly a stop should follow the numeral, which designates the number of the men under arms. <span class="cmt_word">Medeba</span>. Some four miles south-cast of Heshbon (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), or others give it as nine miles. It is not given in Samuel.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-10.htm">1 Chronicles 19:10</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The meaning in brief of this Terse is that, as Joab found there were practically two enemies, and two armies to face, he avoided the mistake of being shut up between them more than necessary, and divided his own hosts. He took the flower of all, under his own command, to face the Syrians in the field, who were the most formidable of the enemy. The rest he put under his brother Abishai, to face the Ammonites at the gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the city Medeba. The plan succeeded, for if Abishai had only done as much as hold back the Ammonites awhile, so soon as they saw the Syrians break and flee they knew that Joab and his army would be free to "help" Abishai.

This is equivalent to saying that, for what he deemed sufficient reasons, Joab did not stay to besiege the Ammonites in the city, within the wails of which they had taken refuge, nor to pursue the Syrians. Hence we find these latter soon made bold to rally and to get additional aid.

The reading of the parallel passage is probably correct, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they "came to Helam," inasmuch as the place is repeated, both in ver. 16 and ver. 17.
