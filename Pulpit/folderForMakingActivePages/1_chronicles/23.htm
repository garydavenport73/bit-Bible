These words give the key note of what remains in this book. David made his son king, as he himself acknowledges (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), under the superintending direction of God. The manner in which the formal event was precipitated by the conduct of Adonijah is found at length in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>. The original occasion alluded to there more than once, on which David promised, "and sware" to Bathsheba, that her son should be his chief heir and successor to the throne, is not distinctly recorded. We can easily assign one convenient place in the history for it to have found monition, viz. in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>. The brevity of the statement which composes this verse, when compared with all the deeply interesting matter recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>, is one among many other very clear illustrations of the purposed silence of our present history in certain directions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-2.htm">1 Chronicles 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span> As on an occasion of supreme importance, David, in view of his own death and of his son's succession at the present time, calls together the full council, and the highest possible representative council of the nation. So <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>; in which last passage the word "captains" should have have been rendered "princes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The arrangement of the Levites, and the distribution of their functions in the presence of the princes, as here described, and as it is even more strongly put (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>), "by" them, simply points to the fact that the ultimate outer authority, as between Church and state, lay with the state. The Church was made for it, not it for the Church. And it was the duty of the state to defend the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward.</span> The thing which Joab had rightly resisted (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-3.htm">1 Chronicles 21:3-6</a>) and shrunk from doing was now rightly done. There was now a practical and a legitimate object for doing it. This consideration helps to determine what it was that "displeased the Lord" in the former general census of David. In connection with this clause, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a> should be noted, where we read, "But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens." The period from the age of thirty years up to fifty (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 23, 35, 39</a>) was fixed under Moses, for those "that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation" (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). It is not certain, however, that this census did not inquire, in point of fact, respecting some below this limit of age. For we may note ver. 24 in the first place, and this is partly explained by <a href="../../par/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-25</a>. The number "thirty and eight thousand" of our present verse may be compared with the "eight thousand and five hundred and four score" of <a href="../../par/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47, 48</a>. It is to be observed how promptly the national council did on this occasion commence with the arrangement of the ministers of religion, "the Levites." As we read (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>) of "thirty years" of age as the appointed age for the commencement of their ministry, and (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>) of the present or "offering" of "six covered waggons and twelve oxen," which the twelve "princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, princes of the tribes," offered "before the Lord," which greatly lessened the laborious work of the Levites; so we find the commencing age reduced from time to time, to "twenty-five" years (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), and to "twenty years" of age, as in our present chapter (vers. 24-28). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">Of which, twenty and four thousand <i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To set forward</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, Piel conjugation). The strict meaning of the word here is <span class="accented">to superintend.</span> The word has already occurred in the same sense in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-21.htm">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Officers and judges</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The explanation of the nature of the work of these, as really outward work, for the "outward business of Israel," is distinctly stated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5-11</a>. These <span class="accented">officers</span> are mentioned under the same Hebrew term in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>, in a very different connection. It is plain that they were generally foremen, or overseers; while the <span class="accented">judges</span> took cognizance of matters which involved the interests of religion. This verse and the following give between them the <span class="accented">four</span> divisions of Levites, afterwards to be more fully described. The fuller account of the "twenty-four thousand" priests (including attendants) occupies ch. 24; the "six thousand" officers and judges, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20-32</a>; the "four thousand" porters, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-19</a>; and the "four thousand who praised the Lord with the instruments," ch. 25. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover four thousand <i>were</i> porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, <i>said David</i>, to praise <i>therewith</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Porters</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>); <span class="accented">doorkeepers.</span> The word is so translated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-23.htm">1 Chronicles 15:23, 24</a>.

There is no connection between either the word or idea we have here, and those of <a href="../../par/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>, where the Hithp. conjugation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5e4;</span> is used, and the sense of residence probably intended to be conveyed. <span class="cmt_word">The instruments which I made...  to praise</span>. Possibly the quotation of a short sentence often on David's lips. Men given to music may have been very conscious of it, in ancient days, as well as in modern. The language, however, does not necessarily assert that David claimed the inventing or in any similar sense the <span class="accented">making</span> of these musical instruments, but that he <span class="accented">appointed</span> them for the service of praise. What some of them were may be seen in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> - "cymbals, psalteries, harps, trumpets" (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>).

This is made clear, not only by the remaining clause of this verse, which says, "These were the chief of the fathers of Landau," and again by the enumeration in ver. 10 of sons of that Shimei who is coupled with Landau in ver. 7, but also by a comparison of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-21.htm">1 Chronicles 26:21-26</a>.

This statement must be read, both with ver. 3 - into the number of Levites mentioned in which Aaron and his sons do not count - and with ver. 14, which implies that Moses and his sons did count into that number.

The duties of the priest are described as threefold, in this place, viz.: "to burn incense before the Lord," - this will carry the idea of making atonement; "to minister to God," on behalf of man, ? this will be one part of the work of a mediator; and "to bless in the Name of God,"  - this will fulfil the remaining part. For <span class="accented">ever.</span> The proviso may, no doubt, include reference to the "ever-living High Priest." The threefold summary of solemn and beneficent duties receives ample illustration from many passages, and in special connection with the names of Aaron and his sons (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1, 38, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 35, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>).

Otherwise we must account for the name of Mahli habitually standing first, as here, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-19.htm">1 Chronicles 6:19</a> also, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26</a>, as also in <a href="../../par/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20, 33</a>, etc.; in all of which places the statement is as distinct as in this verse, that Mahli and Mushi were sons. This and the following verse must be compared particularly with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-29</a>; the <span class="accented">Jaaziah</span> of which passage was evidently no son of Merari, on a par with Mahli and Mushi, but a later descendant. His descendants were three - Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri (Beno being no proper name, but signifying "his son").

(On the present verse comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-3, 21-23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-26</a>.) It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the "thirty" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with "David's last words" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number "thirty" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David.

The "for" of this clause cannot be supposed to account exclusively for the inclusion in the census of Levites beginning from the age of twenty years; it accounts no doubt for the whole proceeding. Since there would be no more journeyings for people, for buildings, or for sacred vessels, it was nosy fully time to organize religious duty and "the service of the house of God" in a manner adapted to permanent institutions. In order to this, the first step was to know and to arrange the number of those who were answerable for sacred duties.

Emphasis is laid on the thought of the relief that permanent habitation in Jerusalem conferred on the Levites over and above the whole body of the rest of the people. They will no more be mere burden-bearers, though the burdens they Bore were of the most sacred character.

The work of these assistants of the "sons of Aaron" is detailed in three or four items, so far as this verse goes.
