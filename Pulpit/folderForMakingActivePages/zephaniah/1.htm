"The name," says Dr. Pussy, "is probably the Syriac name of 'priest,' used in Holy Scripture of idolatrous priests, because the Syrians were idolaters" Not only shall the persons of these priests be cut off, but their very name and memory shall vanish (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the priests</span> (<span class="accented">kohanim</span>).

The worship of the sun, moon, and stars was a very ancient form of error, the heavenly bodies being regarded as the representatives of the powers of nature and the originators of events on earth (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). It was especially prevalent in the time of Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), On the flat roofs of the houses, which were used as places of meditation, recreation, or conference (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), they erected altars for family worship of the heavenly bodies. Here they both burned incense (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>) and offered animal sacrifices (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). "In Syrian cities," says Dr. Thomson, "the roofs are a great comfort. The ordinary houses have no other place where the inmates, can either see the sun, smell the air, dry their clothes, set out their flower pots, or do numberless other things essential to their health and comfort. During a large part of the year the roof is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening. There multitudes sleep during the summer" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Them that worship and that,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the worshippers who</span>, etc. These were people who endeavoured to blend the worship of God with that of Baal, or halted between two opinions (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Swear by the Lord;</span> rather, swear to the <span class="accented">Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bind themselves by oath to him, and at the same time <span class="cmt_word">swear by Malcham;</span> <span class="accented">swear by their king</span>, Baal, or Moloch; call upon him as god.

But it is, perhaps, best to retain the name untranslated, in which ease it would be the appellation of the god Moloch, who could hardly be omitted in enumerating the objects of idolatrous worship (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; and notes on Amos 1:15; 5:26).

The punishment of the wicked is regarded as a satisfaction offered to the Divine justice. <span class="cmt_word">He hath bid his guests;</span> <span class="accented">he hath consecrated his called</span>. The "called ones" are the strange nations whom God summons to execute his vengeance.

These are said to be "sanctified," as if engaged in a holy war, when summoned to punish those who had become as heathen. So those who are called to chastise Babylon are termed "my sanctified ones" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), as being the instruments appointed and set apart to  carry out this purpose (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). The particular agents intended are not specified by the prophet, whose mission was not directed to any such definition. He has to speak generally of the judgment to come, not of those whom God should employ to inflict it. We know from other sources that the Chaldeans are meant, they or the Assyrians being always announced as the executors of God's vengeance on his rebellions people. The notion, adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and others, that the prophet refers to some supposed invasion of Scythians which took place about this time, would never have been started had not such authors desired to eliminate the predictive element from prophetic utterances. The vague account of Herod., 1:105 gives no support to the assertion that the Scythians invaded Palestine in Josiah's reign; nor is there a trace of any knowledge of such irruption in Zephaniah or Jeremiah (see Introduction, &sect; I.).

The royal family, not specially the sons of Josiah, who, if they were then in existence, must have been mere children, but princes of the royal house. The reference may be particularly to the sons of the king reigning when the judgment fell (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). The king himself is not mentioned as subject to the judgment, inasmuch as he was pious and obedient (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>, etc.). In the mention of these "children" Keil finds proof of the late origin of the prophecy. Such as are clothed with strange apparel. This clause must represent the sin for which the princes are "visited." "Strange" apparel means "foreign" apparel, and this implied foreign manners and habits. The Israelites were reminded by their very dress that they were a peculiar people, consecrated to God's service (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-37.htm">Numbers 15:37</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). These nobles, however, assumed the dress of the Egyptians and other nations with which they came in contact, and, despising their own national customs, copied the manners and vices of foreigners (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>; 1 Macc. 1:11-15).

There is no allusion to the circumstance of the priests of Dagon abstaining from treading on the threshold of their temple in consequence of what happened to the idol at Ashdod (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). It is inconceivable that this merely local custom, which demonstrated the impotence of the false god, should have been imported into Judah. where, indeed, the worship of Dagon seems never to have made any way. The following clause explains the meaning which the Latin version intimates, <span class="accented">Omnem qui arroganter ingreditur super limen</span> - all those who, carrying out their masters' wishes, violently invade the houses of others and pillage them of their contents. The expression, "to leap over the threshold," seems to have been a common term for burglary and stealing with violence. <span class="cmt_word">Which fill their masters' houses.</span> These retainers plunder and steal in order that they may increase their masters' treasures. The king (though not Josiah) may be meant, the plural being the plural of majesty, or the idol temples. The LXX., followed by Jerome, renders, "who fill the house of the Lord their God." This is plainly erroneous, as there is no question here about the temple at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Violence and deceit;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of, what they have extorted by, violence and fraud (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a>).

The word is found in <a href="../../par/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a> of a hollow place in a rock, and it is  here used in the sense of "valley," and probably refers to the Tyropoeum, or part of it, the depression that ran down the city, having Aera and Zion on its west side, and Moriah and Ophel on its east, and extended south as far as the pool of Siloam. It does not seem a very appropriate appellation for a lengthy valley like the Tyropceum, nor is there any trace of such a name being applied to it elsewhere. It may have been a name affixed to a certain locality where a bazaar was situated or certain special industries had their seat; or it may have been invented by Zephaniah to intimate the fate that awaited the evil merchants, that they should be, as it were, brayed in a mortar by their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">The merchant people;</span> literally, <span class="accented">people of Canaan.</span> So Septuagint and Vulgate (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; Hist. of Susannah 56; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>).
