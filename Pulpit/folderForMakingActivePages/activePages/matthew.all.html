Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-19</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13-16</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>). This Commentary upon St. Luke deals so fully both with the list as a whole and with the separate names that it will not be necessary to say much here. Observe that the general agreement in arrangement points to some common basis underlying all four accounts; also that of these the one found in the Acts is the briefest, giving little more than the bare names; and that that found in our Gospel, on the contrary, is the fullest, containing, with two exceptions (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), the details mentioned in one or other of the parallels, and adding two of its own. It mentions, in one instance or more, the parentage (Zebedee, Alphaeus), the relationship ("his brother...  his brother"), the birthplace (Kerioth), the earlier occupation and religious standpoint ("publican...  Zealot"), and, with a bare hint at the beginning (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), but a clear statement at the end, the after-history ("first... who also betrayed him") of the apostles. The two omissions are the fact that our Lord added the names of Peter (parallels, but really given earlier, <a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>) and Boanerges (Mark). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the names,</span> In the parallels part of the word "names" is found as a verb, "whom also he named apostles;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the naming there refers, not to the individuals, but to their office. Is the form found in our Gospel an "accidental" rearrangement due to a reminiscence that the word "name" occurred in the earliest source, or is it possible that the two facts are connected, and that the individuals received a new name when they definitely entered on a new office? That they should have received a new name seems <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">priori</span> not improbable, but the evidence is very slight. "Peter" is a clear case, for though the name <span class="accented">was</span> given earlier, it would receive a new application now, and perhaps was now again expressly given (cf. parallel passages); and other cases may be St. Matthew (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.) and possibly St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddaeus. Mark expressly says that the term "<span class="accented">Boanerges"</span> was given to the sons of Zebedee; but as there is no evidence that either St. James or St. John was afterwards known by this name, it need not have been a name in the same sense in which the others were. Observe the formal order of the first words of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Did the author of the Gospel take them from the heading of a section that already contained the names in order? If so the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> would probably not have existed there, and it is worth noting that the original hand of D, the manuscript that is of special value for Palestinian tradition, omits it. <span class="cmt_word">Of the twelve</span> (ver. 1, note) <span class="cmt_word">apostles</span> (ver. 5, note) <span class="cmt_word">are these: The first</span>. This, perhaps, refers to the order of call, <a href="../../par/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a> (Nosgen), but more probably to the leading position that St. Peter held among the twelve.

If the word "Thaddaeus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>) was as seems likely (for Edersheim's connexion of it with <span class="accented">todah</span>, "praise," is based on what is apparently a mere play of words in Talm.

The similarity of sound would help towards this, even if another derivation that seems possible, "the Fiery" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "kindle"), be the true one. In the latter case the appellation, "Jude the Zealot" (Old Latin), may rest on something more than a mistaken interpretation of the parallel passage in Luke. In Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' it is said that "this name [Lebbaeus] is apparently due to an early attempt to bring Levi (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) the publican (<a href="../../par/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27</a>) within the Twelve, it being assumed that his call was to apostleship just as in <a href="../../par/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is changed in Western texts to <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> follows, and it was assumed that the son of Halphseus elsewhere named as one of the Twelve must be meant.

The connexion and development of thought in this important charge is exceedingly difficult to perceive, and has been understood in many ways. Perhaps that most generally accepted in this country is Alford's, according to which the charge is divided into three sections - the first (vers. 5-15) referring to the mission to the cities of Israel; the second (vers. 16-23) to the general mission of the apostles as developing itself, after the Lord should be taken from them, in preaching to Jews and Gentiles, ending with the close of the apostolic period in the narrower sense (ver. 23 referring primarily to the destruction of Jerusalem); the third (vers. 24-42) spoken directly of all the disciples of the Lord, concluding with the last great reward. But this threefold historical arrangement seems to be little more than fanciful, the basis of truth Underlying it probably being that the charge in its present form is due to the writer of the Gospel (nor to our Lord directly), who desired not only to record what our Lord said at the time of this mission, but also to incorporate other sayings of his that bore upon similar work, and thus to give such a summary of our Lord's utterances as would be of special use to preachers of the gospel, irrespective of place or time. Observe that ch. 5. - vii, referred to believers in their private capacity - laying stress on the relation that they were to hold to the religion of the day - while this chapter refers to them as representing Christ to the world. The original basis of the commission was addressed to men called to give their whole time to this work, but as the chapter stands it applies to all believers in their  capacity of witnesses for Christ. The ministerial function of preaching committed to men selected for it is only an accentuation of one of the duties expected from all Christ's followers. The development of thought in the chapter appears to be as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The external conditions of conveying Christ's message, with special reference to the immediate occasion (vers. 5<span class="accented">b</span> - 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The internal conditions (vers. 16-39). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 16-23: Though surrounded by enemies, you must conduct yourselves with calmness (ver. 19); with endurance (ver. 22); with wisdom (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 24-33: Remembering that fellowship with me in suffering is essential to fellowship with me in glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Vers. 34-39: Such fellowship with me will cost separation from the dearest on earth, yet its reward is great. 3.

Had they accepted it, they would have become the great factors in the evangelization of the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12, 15</a>); as they rejected it, it was necessary that the offer should, apart from them, be made to others (<a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The apostles were as yet in no fit state spiritually to carry the message beyond their own nation, and the facts which they were in a position to proclaim might, when proclaimed alone, have proved a stumbling-block to the after-acceptance by Gentiles and Samaritaus of a fuller and therefore truer message (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Therefore they are now bid perform their present duty without turning away from it, and, as we may add, will-out anticipating their entrance upon a wider sphere. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Go not</span>. This would be outside your course (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). In the Greek, however, the following words receive the <span class="accented">emphasis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Into the</span> (<span class="accented">any</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">way of the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> These words are generally understood to mean "into any road that would lead to Gentile lands or districts." So Tyndale, "Go not into the wayes that leade to the gentyls." (For this genitive of direction, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and perhaps, Judith 5:14.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.,' takes them as equivalent to "into any street in a heathen land," making the genitives, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, both possessive. There are serious objections to these two interpretations; to the first, that the genitives are then used in different senses; to the second, that it suggests something altogether outside the Israelitish border. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Is not a third interpretation possible - to consider flint our Lord had in his mind the parts of towns, otherwise Jewish, which were inhabited by heathen, just as, in the days of Omri and Ahab, such parts were assigned to Syrians in Samaria, and to Israelites in Damascus, or in modern times to Jews in Christian towns? We have not, indeed, direct evidence of Gentiles, during the time of our Lord, thus living in separate streets, but with the Jewish aversion to even letting them houses and to having more to do with them than possible (cf. Schurer, II. 1:51-56), it would seem probable that, without any formal arrangement being made, the result would be separation of this kind. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is not used elsewhere in this sense in the New Testament, but a comparison of passages in the LXX. seems to justify our so interpreting it. For <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>, means such streets, and the LXX. for this is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), yet <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in the sense of "streets," is often elsewhere rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>). Compare especially <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>, "in the streets of Ascalon," where, for the common text, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Lucian's reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The expression thus means - Go not off into any quarter (of such towns as you may come across) inhabited by Gentiles, and (both in complete parallelism and with perfect accuracy, for Samaritans dwelt alone) into any city of Samaritans enter ye not. <span class="cmt_word">And into any city</span>. In the Greek both clauses are in the same order, the verb coming last. It will be noticed that the Revised Version has transposed both for the sake of uniformity. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Samaritans</span>. By <span class="accented">descent</span>, a mixed race, from the intermingling of the remnants of the Israelitish population more especially with the heathen colonists introduced by the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>); by <span class="accented">religion</span>, so far Israelite as to have accepted the Pentateuch, and to have maintained the observance of circumcision, the sabbath, and the annual festivals. Both sides of their  connexion with Israel seem to have contributed to their being placed by the Mishna between Jews and Gentiles (cf. further, Schurer, II. 1:5, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Enter ye not</span>. A slight turning away would sometimes bring them to Gentile quarters; but into a Samaritan town they would have definitely and purposely to enter. Observe that our Lord himself so far extended his own practice as not to refuse to take the opportunity of preaching to a Samaritan woman when it presented itself, and further followed up the work thus begun by continuing two days in her village (<a href="../../par/john/4-40.htm">John 4:40</a>). But the nature of the exception proves the rule.

There is no connotation of foresight in the word itself, but only of acquisition. Observe that the apostles are not forbidden to take what they already have. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' shows that travellers ordinarily took with them a staff, a purse, shoes, a wallet, and sometimes a book of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Neither gold, nor silver, nor brass</span>. The <span class="accented">brass</span> would be the copper coinage of the Herods (examples are figured in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' 2. p. 413), which alone might be struck by them; or some of the Greek imperial coins, especially those struck at Antioch. The <span class="accented">silver</span>, either Greek imperial tetradrachms or Roman denarii of a quarter their weight, didrachms having fallen into disuse; only certain free cities were allowed to coin silver. The <span class="accented">gold</span>, as Palestine was a subject province, must have been coined at Rome, for she retained the coining of gold entirely in her own hands (cf. Madden's 'Coins of the Jews,' pp. 107, 290, ft., edit. 1881; and It. S. Peele, in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' <span class="accented">s.vv.</span> "Money," "Stater;" further, see ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In your purses</span>; literally, <span class="accented">girdles</span>, which in the East often serve as purses. This prohibition may have been suggested by the last words of ver. 8, but can hardly refer to them. It seems to regard the journey only (cf. parallel passages). <span class="cmt_word">Nor scrip</span>; no <span class="accented">wallet</span> (Revised Version). At the present time, "all shepherds have them, and they are the farmer's universal <span class="accented">vade-mecum.</span> They are merely the skins of kids stripped off whole, and tanned by a very simple process" (Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 345, edit. 1887, where a picture of one is given). But they might be made even of fish-skin (Mishna, 'Kelim,' 24:11). Because of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>, an haggada says that David's money was stamped with a staff and wallet on one side, and a tower on the other ('B'resh..R.,' &sect; 39, in Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>  <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your journey</span>. The clause is to be joined with "scrip" only. <span class="cmt_word">Neither two coats</span>. A second for sabbaths and festivals. For the rabbinic rule insisted upon a different coat for these days from that ordinarily worn. To the objection of poor disciples, that they had but one garment for sabbath and week-day alike, R. Samlai said that they must at least change the way in which they wore it (Talm. Jeremiah. 'Pea.,' 8:7 [S], in Hamburger, 'Realencycl.,' 2. p. 642. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shoes</span>. The parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/6-9.htm">Mark 6:9</a>, has. "but <span class="accented">to go</span> shod with sandals" (Revised Version). This is, perhaps, a case of verbal inaccuracy, but as it is impossible to suppose that our Lord can have wished his disciples to go without the ordinary protection to the feet, or that the author of this Gospel, accustomed, on any theory, to Eastern modes of life, can have intended to credit him with such a wish, some other explanation of the verbal discrepancy must be looked for. The true explanation is probably this - The rabbis insisted so strongly on a man never appearing barefooted: "Let a man sell the beams of his house and buy shoes for his feet" (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 129<span class="accented">a</span>), that it is very possible that a second pair was often carried in ease of need. it is this that our Lord forbids. On the other hand, Jews did not carry one pair for sabbath and another for week-days (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Sabb.,' 6:2). Some commentators escape the difficulty by distinguishing between "shoes" and "sandals;" but it is very doubtful if the usage of the words is always so exact that one term excludes the other. <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet staves</span>; <span class="accented">nor staff</span> (Revised Version). The plural, both here (Stephen) and in <a href="../../par/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a> (Received Text), is a clumsy attempt to harmonize with <a href="../../par/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>.8, where our Lord bids the twelve take nothing "save a staff only." The difference between the two reports of our Lord's words has been magnified by many commentators into a contradiction. But this is not the true state of the case. For it would be so extraordinary and apparently so useless an order to forbid their having a staff, that it is hard to suppose this to have been the meaning of his words as <span class="accented">reported</span> here. His thought in vers. 9, 10 is rather that they were to make no preparation, for their wants should be supplied, and that even if they had not a staff they were not to take the trouble to procure one. St. Mark's account only so far differs that he assumes that they will st least have a staff already. Observe, however, that no stress can be placed on the difference of the verbs here and in Mark, for in this respect Mark and Luke agree. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the workman</span>; <span class="accented">labourer</span> (Revised Version); thus connecting the utterance closely with <a href="../../par/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Is worthy of his meat</span>. The disciples may therefore expect that it will be provided for them by those to whom they minister (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, of the seventy), and indirectly by the Master whom they serve (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). <span class="accented">Meat</span>; <span class="accented">food</span> (Revised Version). In all but most highly organized systems of society, this is an important (frequently the most important) part of the day labourer's wages. Hence not unnaturally "<span class="accented">wages"</span> is found in the form of the sayings given by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>). Probably our Lord's words became a current proverb in Christian circles, the original word "<span class="accented">food"</span> being modified to suit the more general circumstances of life. Clem. Romans, &sect; 31, recalls the Matthaean form, "The good workman receiveth the bread of his work with boldness." Epiphanius gives a kind of confla-tion, containing the further thought that if the workman receives his food he must be content: "The workman is worthy of his hire, and sufficient to him that works is his food." Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 97, 140) connects this form of the saying with the practice of giving only food to the travelling "apostles" and prophets of the sub-apostolic age ('Did.,' &sect; 11.). Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 2:76) suggests that if our Lord's original word was <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, it would explain the origin of both Matthew and Luke; but it seems very doubtful it' it really ever means "<span class="accented">wages."</span> Two patristic remarks are worth quoting: the first from Origen ('Cram. Cat.'), "In saying <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, ('food') he forbade <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> ('luxury');" the second from St. Gregory the Great (in Ford), "Priests ought to consider how criminal and punishable a thing it is to receive the fruit of labour, without labour."

St. Luke's "Go not from house to house" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). It is, on the other hand, quite unnecessary to see here, with Meyer and Weiss, a prohibition to go to the synagogues or indeed to anywhere else where they could gain a hearing during their stay.

App. 11.) thus summarizes the enactments on Jewish scourging as recorded in the Mishna ('Makkoth'): "Even a single Jewish scourging might well entitle any man to be regarded as a martyr. Thirty-nine blows were inflicted, unless, indeed, it was found that the strength of the patient was too much exhausted to admit of his receiving the full number. Both of his bands were tied to what is sometimes called a column. but which was in reality a stake a cubit and a half high. The public officer then tore down his robe until his breast was laid bare. The executioner stood on a stone behind the criminal. The scourge consisted of two thongs, one of which was composed of four strands of calf's skin, and one or two strands of ass's skin, which passed through a hole in a handle. The executioner, who was ordinarily the <span class="accented">Chazzan</span> of the synagogue, could thus shorten or lengthen them at will, so as not to strike too low. The prisoner bent to receive the blows, which were inflicted with one hand, but with all the force of the striker, thirteen on the breast, thirteen on the right and thirteen on the left shoulder. While the punishment was going on, the chief judge read aloud <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58, 59</a>, 'If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God; then the Lord will make thy plagues ["strokes"] wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed.' He then read <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>, 'Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that  ye may prosper in all ye do;' and lastly, <a href="../../par/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38, 39</a>, 'But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away. and did not stir up all his wrath.' If the punishment was not over by the time that these three passages were read, they were again repeated, and so timed as to end exactly with the punishment itself Meanwhile a second judge numbered the blows, and a third before each blow exclaimed, '<span class="accented">Hakkehu</span> ('strike him') The severity of the pain may best be estimated by the brief addition, ' <span class="accented">If the criminal die under the infliction</span>, the executioner is not accounted guilty unless he gives by mistake a single blow too many, in which case he is banished.'"

Not every one shall acquire the technical name of "righteous," but those who help such a man shall share his reward (ver. 4l); even the smallest kindnesses shall not be unrewarded (ver. 42). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth you receiveth me</span>.

Here, however, this is hardly the case, the word appearing to retain its idea of both name and corresponding position. The preposition may mean <span class="accented">either</span> receive him into the position of a prophet, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into the treatment with which a prophet should be received; <span class="accented">or</span>, simply, receive him at the rank and standing of a prophet (<a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>). Anyhow, it is in contrast to receiving him out of mere human compassion or ordinary friendliness. The reception is to have regard to that which the name implies, for the sake of the cause that the prophet represents. <span class="cmt_word">Shall receive a prophet's reward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall share in the reward of that work in which by his kindness to the prophet he so tar takes part.

(On <span class="accented">reward</span>, see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>, note.) Observe that not the action, but the motive for the action, is made all-important.

This word also is used in a quasi-Jewish sense, and points back to the time when Jewish Christians performed, not only the law as expounded in the sermon on the mount, but also those external rites and observances which had been commanded them as Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>). Among such Jewish Christians some would he especially noticeable for their regard to these things (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the "Just," or "Righteous"), and it is to one of these that the epithet here refers.

The title may be merely due to the evangelist's narrative, or may represent the actual terms in which the message was brought to John. It brings out the pathos of the situation.

Although John might justly fear that they would follow him rather than Jesus (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>, note), yet he seems to have made this inquiry for his own sake. He who stood on the Jewish side of the threshold of the kingdom (ver. 11) did not understand the methods by which the King was acting, and thus his faith was tried (comp. Tertullian, 'Adv. Marc.,' 4:18). In this he recalls his great prototype, whose plans seemed to have failed and his boldness to have done no good (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 14</a>).

Observe that in both records the evangelist's own summary of John's message speaks of a difference in kind, but that in the form given by the messengers (<a href="../../par/luke/7-20.htm">Luke 7:20</a>) it is only a matter of a second person coming (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 15:39, etc.).

Although John's difficulty had been felt when he heard of the works (ver. 2, note), our Lord only said in reply, "Tell him of my works." It was an old message, and yet a new one. In the nature of those works, when fully understood, lay the true solution of his difficulty. Observe that here also Christ adds a Beatitude (ver. 6). <span class="accented">The blind</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>, note), (<span class="accented">and the lame.</span> The "and" is doubtless genuine here, its omission in some manuscripts being due to the parallel passage in Luke.

It almost suggests that they went out as though to see a spectacle. They were stirred by no deeper motive. Bengel compares <a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A reed shaken with the wind?</span> If the reed referred to by our Lord was the papyrus, which still grows freely in certain parts of the Jordan valley, the description of this plant in 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' ch. 17, is specially interesting: "There is first a lateral trunk, lying on the water and half-submerged. This is sometimes as thick as a man's body, and from its lower side hang innumerable string-like roots from three to five feet long, and of a deep purple colour .... These pendent roots...  retard much of the surface-current where the papyrus grows On the upper surface of the trunks the stems grow alternately in oblique rows;, their thickness at the junction is often four inches, and their height fifteen feet, gracefully tapering until at the top is a little round knob, with long, thin brown, wire-like hairs eighteen inches long, which rise and then, recurving, hang about it in a thyrsus-shaped head." He also says, "The whole jungle of papyrus was <span class="accented">floating upon the water</span>, and so the waves raised by the breeze were rocking the green curtain to and fro." This explained "a most curious hissing, grinding, bustling sound, that was heard like waves upon a shingly beach," as "the papyrus stems were rubbing against each other as they nodded out and in." It is, however, much more probable that the reed referred to was "the <span class="accented">Arundo donax</span>, a very tall cane, growing twelve feet high, with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It grows especially on the western  side of the Dead Sea (cf. Tristram, 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 4,37, edit. 1889). To our Lord's question no answer was needed. John had rejected the overtures of the nationalists (<a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19-21</a>), and had not feared to rebuke a king (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-4.htm">Matthew 14:4</a>).

Menahem the Essene was by the wish of Herod the Great made deputy to Hillel in the Sanhedrin, but afterwards left his office. "Whither did he go out? Abai said. He went out to destruction. Rabba said, He went out for the service of the king. There is also a Baraitha [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> an 'uncanonical' Mishna] to this effect, that Menahem went out for the service of the king, and there went out with him eighty pairs of disciples clothed in Syrian robes" (Talm. Bab., 'Chagigah,' 16b, edit. Streane). It has been conjectured, though hardly on sufficient evidence, that our Lord was thinking of this case; but the Talmudic passage at least illustrates the gorgeousness of the apparel of the courtiers, and suggests the luxury of living that St. Luke speaks of ("They which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts"). It is, however, only fair to Menahem to say that Gratz ('Geschichte der Judaer,' 3. p. 230, edit. 1877) is able to suppose that he merely went back again to his solitude.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a></div><div class="verse">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - It is curious that in St. Luke's account of this speech of our Lord's he should omit our vers. 12-14 (on ver. 15, see note there), thus leaving out all Christ's plainer and more direct teaching about the relation of John to himself. St. Luke places (<a href="../../par/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>) our vers. 12 and 13 in what appears to be merely a cento of sayings. Possibly the original occasion has been recorded by neither evangelist, but in Matthew the passage certainly brings out the thought upon which our Lord was insisting on this occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>.

Possibly the sentence had become modified in oral teaching, so as to include many years, say up to A.D.  or 60.

In Luke it is middle, "Every man entereth violently into it;" and though it is certainly passive here, St. Luke's phrase compels us to understand the reason of the violence to be entrance into the kingdom. The kingdom is not ill treated, but it is as it were taken by storm (Meyer). Nosgen strangely understands the phrase to mean that the kingdom is set forward with power, and he would apparently see in "the violent" a special reference to our Lord and John. <span class="cmt_word">And the violent</span>; <span class="accented">and men of violence</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>: only they; men whose mind is made up and who care not what force and power they employ to attain their object. <span class="cmt_word">Take it by force</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "grasp it for themselves," like rough and violent bandits seizing their prey. Weiss sees in this verse blame of the politico-Messianic endeavours to hasten the completion of the kingdom. This explanation is good in itself (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>), but disconnects the verse from its context. Our Lord is describing the energy with which some souls are pressing in, and urging the need of such energy if salvation is to be obtained.

And <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> thus gives au excellent sense. Our Lord says that the Divine Wisdom is justified in the minds of men from the results she brings about. Of what is he thinking? Doubtless moral results, and probably those found in the change that might be seen in the publicans and sinners of which he has just been speaking. The Divine Wisdom, which appeared to the careless and unsympathetic so strange and changeable in her methods, is, notwithstanding, pronounced to be in the right, because of the results of her activity, the men and the women brought under her influence. These <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>) are always the best justification of misunderstood plans. While, however, this seems the best interpretation of the sentence as recorded in Matthew, it must be confessed that in Luke it appears more natural to understand "her children" as those who justify her; and further, this was probably St. Luke's own interpretation. For he seems to purposely give an explanation of the apothegm in the verses (<a href="../../par/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29, 30</a>) by which he joins the equivalent of our vers. 16-19 to the equivalent of our ver. 11. He there tells us that all the people and the publicans "justified God," having been baptized with the baptism of John, but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's plan towards them, not having been baptized by him. Wisdom's children justified her; others did not. Anyhow, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would appear to be the more original of the two terms, for with the explanation preferred above, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would be very easily derived from it. It may, indeed, be due to a more primitive confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> ("her works," cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> ("her servants," Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>), this last word being commonly rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and, perhaps through <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, even <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. Reseh, ' Agrapha,' p. 277), but even then it is unlikely that the former and harder reading should be only due to a mistake for the latter. That the harder and metaphorical should be changed into the easier and more literal, even as early as St. Luke's time, appears much more probable.

We know no other occasion which would be so likely to evoke this utterance. Although it is just possible that the seventy returned when our Lord was addressing the people in the manner related in the preceding verses of this chapter, it seems much more likely that a sense of a moral and not of a temporal connexion guided St. Matthew in his arrangement. What is true in a time of success (<a href="../../par/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>) is equally true in a time of failure (vers. 20-24). Observe the difference in the style of ver. 27 (<a href="../../par/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>) from that of vers. 25, 26, suggesting the use of another, apparently Johannine, source. But this must have been added before either St. Matthew or St. Luke incorporated the passage. Observe that the comparatively  early date thus indicated for Johannine phraseology suggests that the language and form of the Fourth Gospel underwent a long process of development before St. John completed his work. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>; <span class="accented">season</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>.

St. Matthew's refers rather to that stage or period in his ministry (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span>. Only in Matthew. If we could suppose this to be the original context of the passage, the" answer" would probably refer to some expression of astonishment or complaint at his solemn statement in vers. 20-24. Professor Marshall's derivation of both "answered" and "rejoiced" (Luke) from a common Aramaic original (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891) appears very strained. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I thank thee</span>; better, as the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">praise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). There is no thought of gratitude, but of publicity in assent (<a href="../../par/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>), in confession (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) and in acknowledgment (<a href="../../par/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>), and thus of praise (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a> (Lucian); <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It implies a profession of personal acceptance by Christ of God's methods. "I profess to thee my entire and joyful acquiescence in what thou doest."

The word expresses perfect relationship and intimate communion.

As "Father" was the note of personal relationship, so is this of sovereign majesty.

In ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>: here, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>. There the term referred more directly to God as his own Father; here to him as Father of all, notwithstanding the methods he used. For. Giving the reason of Christ's acceptance. <span class="accented">That</span> (Revised Version margin) would make this clause closely dependent on the preceding. But this seems unnatural. <span class="cmt_word">So</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in this double method. <span class="cmt_word">It seemed good</span> (<span class="accented">it was well-pleasing</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">in thy sight</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">it was good pleasure before thee -</span> an Aramaism equivalent to "it was thy will" (compare the Targum of <a href="../../par/judges/13-23.htm">Judges 13:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>]; see also <a href="../../par/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>). The phrase implies, not merely that it seemed good to God, but that, in a sense, it was his pleasure. For the workings out of the laws of truth must give pleasure to the <span class="cmt_word"></span> God of truth. (On the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, see ver. 25, note.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Matthew 11:27 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">things.</span> Not in the widest sense, for this would forestall ch. 28:18 but all things that are required for my work <span class="cmt_word">of</span> manifesting the truth. The utterance is thus both closely parallel to <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>, and also in most intimate connexion with the preceding verses. God's twofold action in hiding the truth from some and revealing it to others is, our Lord says, all of a piece with my whole work. This is all arranged by my Father, and the knowledge of God by any man is no chance matter. <span class="cmt_word">Are</span> <span class="cmt_word">delivered unto me;</span> <span class="accented">have been delivered</span> (Revised Version); rather, <span class="accented">were delivered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Here also it is possible to interpret the aorist from the standpoint of the hereafter (ver. 25, note); but, as it is immediately followed by the present tense, it more probably refers to some time earlier than that at which our Lord was speaking. The time of his entrance on the world naturally suggests itself. Observe when bringing out his dependence upon his Father, our Lord lays stress on the notion of transmission (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); but in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where he is bringing out his post-resurrection greatness (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>), he merely mentions his authority as an absolute gift (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Notice the contrast implied in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> to the Jewish <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Pharisees boasted that their tradition came from God, though through many hands; Christ claimed to have received his from God himself. <span class="cmt_word">Of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>). For the transmission was immediate; there were no links between the Giver and the Receiver (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My Father</span>; me...  my. Observe the double claim; his unique position as Teacher is due to his unique relation by nature. <span class="cmt_word">And no man knoweth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a gradual, but at last complete, perception (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). In the Gospels this word is used of the knowledge of God and of Christ in this verse alone, though such a reference is especially suited to its meaning of perfection of know. ledge (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Son</span>. Not "me," because Christ wished <span class="cmt_word">to</span> bring out more clearly his unique relation to God, and thus to emphasize the impossibility of any one, even an advanced disciple, fully knowing him. <span class="cmt_word">But the Father</span>. Not "his Father." It may be that Christ wishes to include the suggestion that after all there is a sense in which his Father is the Father of all men, but more probably, by making <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> completely parallel to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, he wishes to suggest that the full idea of Sonship and Fatherhood is nowhere else so fully satisfied. <span class="cmt_word">Neither knoweth any man</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, save the Son, and</span> he <span class="cmt_word">to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</span> The connexion is - You may think this (<span class="accented">i.e. ver.</span> 25) strange, but I alone have that knowledge of God which enables me to understand his ways; I alone, yet others also, if I reveal him to them. As St. Luke expressed it in his form of our ver. 19, "Wisdom is justified of her children" (comp. also <a href="../../par/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">To whomsoever.</span> Though but a babe (ver. 25). <span class="accented">Will reveal</span>; <span class="accented">willeth to reveal</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Not "is commanded," for Christ claims equality (see Chrysostom). Notice the idea of plan and deliberation, and not that of mere desire, unable, perhaps, to assign a reason for its existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>.

The toilers and burdened (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Our Lord purposely did not define in what the toil and burden consisted; for he would include all, from whatever quarter their toil and burden came. But since the spiritual is the central part of man (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note), the more that the toil or burden is felt there so much the stronger would our Lord's reference to it be. He would therefore be inviting most especially those that toil in legal ways of righteousness (<a href="../../par/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2, 3</a>), and are burdened under Pharisaic enactments (<a href="../../par/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I.</span> Emphatic (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>).

Not to be identified with the phrase in ver. 29 (see there). As contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a> and on Ignat., 'Ephesians,' &sect; 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> refers to temporary rather than permanent cessation from work, and it thus especially connotes refreshment of body and soul obtained through such rest. In confortuity with this we find <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> regularly used in the LXX. as a translation of <span class="accented">sabbathon</span> ("sabbath-keeping," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, for which <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> comes in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a> as an equivalent). The thought, therefore, here is not that those who come  to Christ will have no more work, but that Christ will give them at once such rest and refreshment of soul that they may be fit for work, should God have any in store for them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a></div><div class="verse">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Vers. 29, 30 have so much in common with both the language and the thought of Ecclus. 51:26, 27, that probably this passage was in our Lord's mind. It is noteworthy that most of the other signs of acquaintance with Ecclesiasticus are found in the Epistle of St. James (cf. Edersheim, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on Ecclesiasticus, p. 22). <span class="cmt_word">Take my</span> <span class="cmt_word">yoke upon you</span>. For there is work to be done, therefore enter on it. The yoke is the service that Christ gives us to do, and therefore implies more than his teaching. This, however, is so important a part of his service, both in itself and as being the means of knowing what he wishes done, that Christ speaks of it as though almost identical with his yoke. (On the figure of the yoke, compare a note by Professor Ryle and Mr. James, in 'Psalms of Solomon,' 7:8, suggesting that our Lord was contrasting his yoke with the yoke of minute legal observance laid upon the people by the scribes and Pharisees. For a detailed description of the yoke and plough used now in Palestine, see an article by Dr. Post in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration for 1891, p. 112.) <span class="cmt_word">And learn of me</span>. The figure of the oxen passes into that of the scholars. The "of" is slightly ambiguous, and may refer to Christ as the Example from which they may draw the lesson for themselves (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>), or as the Teacher who will himself instruct them (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>). The second meaning is more suitable here. (For the thought, comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The reason why they should learn from him and no other teacher. He alone was what he claimed to teach, therefore he alone could teach it properly, and therefore from him alone could they learn that type of character which they ought to develop. <span class="cmt_word">I am</span>. Observe the claim. It is almost greater than that of ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Meek</span>. Primarily, as regards God (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, note). Receiving in my degree whatever yoke my Father puts on me. <span class="cmt_word">And lowly in heart</span>. As regards men. Observe that <span class="accented">meek</span> and <span class="accented">lowly</span> correspond, though the order is reversed, to "He humbled himself and became obedient" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to the Incarnation (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), but to his relation to others in this world). <span class="accented">In heart</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, note). "Lowly in heart" very nearly corresponds to "he that is of a lowly spirit." Such a person as Christ's experience shows (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) "shall obtain honour" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall find rest unto your souls</span>. In this learning and service. The words are taken from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a> (not the LXX.; cf. also Ecclus. 6:28), where they form the promise given to those that ask for the old paths and walk in the good way of the Divine commandments. But these roads were now more clearly made known in Christ. Observe the full force of the two expressions, <span class="accented">I will give you rest</span> (ver. 28), and <span class="accented">Ye shall find rest.</span> The tired comers are at once refreshed by Christ; these accept his service and teaching, and in performing it find further rest. The first rest may be termed the peace of justification; the second, <span class="accented">that</span> of sanctification. Both are obtained through Christ alone, yet they are not to be confused, much less identified, with one another.

A similarly difficult neuter is found in vers. 41, 45. If the neuter be insisted upon, we must understand Christ to refer to his cause, the work in which the disciples were engaged. This was greater than the temple; lunch more, therefore, was it greater than the sabbath. Probably, however, our Lord is referring to himself, to his own Person and character, but uses the neuter, either as forming a more decided contrast to <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, or as being more weighty than the masculine (cf. ch. 11:9, note). Also it was less defined and more mysterious. He could not reveal to them the secret of his presence. Observe the use, even at this stage in his ministry, of words implying the decadence of the temple service (cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). <span class="accented">In this place</span>; <span class="accented">here</span> (Revised Version), as in vers. 41, 42.

Christ clinches the argument, and at the same time explains his phrase in ver. 6. The temple is greater than the sabbath; I am greater than the temple; these my disciples are therefore guiltless; for, to put it briefly, I, whom they are following, am greater than the sabbath and rule over it. Observe, however, that Christ does not directly say "I," but <span class="accented">the Son of man.</span> The reason is seen in Mark, where a connecting link is given: "The sabbath was made for man. and not man for the sabbath: so that the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath." Christ there implies that the sabbath is inferior to man, not only because it exists for his sake (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-9.htm">1 Corinthians 11:9</a>),but also because it falls under the lordship referred to in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; and therefore that he himself is really superior to it as man, and much more as the ideal Man (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note). Our saying is very condensed, but includes the name thought, omitting <span class="accented">even</span> as unnecessary, after having definitely pronounced the innocence of his disciples. (For the thought of the saying, cf. 2 Macc. 5:19, "God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake," and the Midrash 'Mechilta,' on <a href="../../par/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, especially the words, "The sabbath is given to you, not yon to the sabbath."

In this section the opposition of the Pharisees is turned directly against our Lord himself for breaking the sabbath. Observe, however, that he did not do this for his own benefit.

When. therefore, it took place we have absolutely no means of knowing, save that it was not on the same day as the event recorded in vers. 1-8 (cf.

According to the LXX. of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, David's expression about Solomon affords a curious parallel, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (edit. Dr. Swete). But Lagarde's edition of the Lucianic text punctuates and accents differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and this is much nearer to the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">My beloved, in whom my soul is well</span> <span class="cmt_word">pleased</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, note): <span class="cmt_word">I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show</span> (declare, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">judgment to the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). Although <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> usually represents in the New Testament God's decision as to the character and life of men, it here must be understood, like <span class="accented">mishpat</span> in the original, of the Divine right as made known to them for their acceptance and imitation. It is "the true religion viewed on its practical side as a norm and standard for life in all its relations" (Delitzsch). The thought here, therefore, is not of Christ's power to punish and avenge (though he refused to use it as yet), but of his bringing a revelation which should eventually spread, not only to the Jews who now rejected him, but to the Gentiles whom they despised. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a></div><div class="verse">He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not strive, nor cry</span>. In Isaiah the clause is, "He shall not cry aloud nor lift up <span class="accented">his voice</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5e2;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;</span>);" and so the LXX. But "strive" would represent one very frequent connotation of "cry aloud" and its synonyms, for in Eastern lands disputants use their voice much more loudly than we do. This close connexion between the two ideas is seen also in the Syriac Version of Isaiah,. where "lift up <span class="accented">his voice"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> translated <span class="accented">narib</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> word meaning primarily "he shall strive," and only secondarily "he shall lift up his voice." It is possible, but not probable, that Matthew's "strive" is taken directly from <span class="accented">narib</span>, adopting its primary and commoner meaning, and transposed. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall any man hear his voice in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">streets.</span> A slight paraphrase of the original, "nor cause his voice to he heard in the street," perhaps due to different vocalization of the Hebrew.

Yet he reckons neither as useless; he allows for possibilities of improvement. His treatment of the believer who is weakest, and, so to speak, least alive, is marked by long-suffering and gentleness. Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Matthew omits the words, "He shall not burn dimly nor be discouraged," because he is not concerned with anything else than Christ's relation to others; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he combines into one the two clauses of Isaiah, "<span class="accented">He</span> shall bring forth judgment in truth" and "<span class="accented">Till</span> he have set judgment in the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Till he send forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span>). This being the supreme object of Messiah's life and energy  - bringing out, as from his own plans and resources, <span class="cmt_word">judgment unto victory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the revelation of the Divine Law (ver. 18, note) to a successful issue in human hearts. <span class="accented">Unto victory.</span> Apparently only a paraphrase of the thought in Isaiah.

The evangelist thus completes the parallelism with the end of the first stanza (ver. 18) However Jews treat Messiah, Gentiles shall place their hope in his Name, which, in fact, sums up for man all that can be known of God (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>, note). <span class="accented">In his Name.</span> So even the LXX. But the Hebrew, "in his Law." <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is possibly due to a confusion with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, but is more probably merely a paraphrase bringing out more clearly the fact that the Christian religion is emphatically trust in a Person. <span class="accented">The Gentiles</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, as such. This paraphrase for "isles" in the original is also found in the LXX.

The manner of the sure was this: he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to return into him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed" (cf. also Dr. Cheatham's article on "Exorcism," in 'Dict. of Christian Antiq.'). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they</span>.

(For the article, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">And spoil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">his goods.</span> Carry off his household tools and utensils (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Except he first bind</span> <span class="cmt_word">the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</span> This is more than merely the conclusion.

The interpretation of the parable is self-evident: the strong man is Satan; his vessels are those afflicted by him; the one who binds, etc., is Christ. For Christ's appearance and work, even before the Crucifixion and Resurrection, bound Satan in this respect. Observe that there is probably a tacit reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, which at any rate now received a fulfilment.

The aim of this verse is doubtful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It may be addressed to the Pharisees, with the object of showing them what their words really implied. They were not due, as some might think, to mere indifferentism or to a judicial neutrality; such a relation to him was impossible. They were due to opposition of inner life and of outward energy. Thus their words denoted complete separation from him. This he brings out more clearly in the two following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, would attribute to the Pharisees too great an ignorance of their own feelings of opposition to Christ, and it is therefore best to understand the verse as addressed to the many bystanders. Christ has do-fended himself from the accusation brought against him, and now urges these waverers not to be content with only not opposing him, but to take sides - for, in fact, they cannot help doing so. Indifference in this case is only another name for opposition; not actively to help is really to hinder. Thus understood, the lesson of this verse finds its parallel in vers. 43-45, by which,  indeed, it is immediately followed in Luke. <span class="cmt_word">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad</span>. The first clause speaks of the inner disposition, that which forms the real being of the man; the second, of his energy. Observe that the figure of the second clause appears to be connected with that of ver. 29. If Christ's property is not collected, it is driven further from him. Christ and Christians must gather (<a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>; cf. Bengel). For <span class="accented">gathereth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>. In <span class="accented">scattereth abroad</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the thought almost leaves the simile of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>, and regards the persons signified. Notice that in <a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, referred to above, the two verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, also occur; the figure there, however, appears to be taken from sheep (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). Further, <a href="../../par/mark/9-40.htm">Mark 9:40</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/9-50.htm">Luke 9:50</a> record the saying, "He that is not against us is for us," which was addressed to our Lord's disciples. Both sayings are necessary; earnest Christians need to remember that when outsiders do anything in Christ's name, it must, on the whole, forward his cause (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-18.htm">Philippians 1:18</a>); the undecided must face the fact that neutrality is impossible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/12-31.htm">Matthew 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy <i>against</i> the <i>Holy</i> Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/3-28.htm">Mark 3:28-30</a> (where the verses immediately follow our ver. 29) and <a href="../../par/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a> (where the context is not the same, he having passed straight from our ver. 30 to our ver. 43, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). It is to be observed that all three accounts differ a good deal in form, though but slightly in substance. The Apostolical Constitutions contain what is probably a mixture of these verses with <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a> and other passages of the New Testament. Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 130, 249, etc.), in accordance with his theory, thinks that the Constitutions have preserved a genuine utterance of the Lord, of which only different fragments are presented in various parts of the New Testament. A few words of introduction to these difficult verses. It has been strangely forgotten, in their interpretation, that our Lord spoke in language that he intended his hearers to understand, and that probably not a single one of those who stood by would understand by the expressions, ,, the Spirit" (ver. 31), "the Holy Spirit" (ver. 32), a Person in the Godhead distinct from the First Person or the Second (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>, note). At most they would understand them to refer to an influence by God upon men (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>), such as Christ had claimed to possess in a special degree (<a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). In inquiring, therefore, for an explanation of our Lord's sayings, we must not begin at the Trinitarian standpoint, and see in the words a contrast between "blasphemy" against one Person of the Trinity, and "<span class="accented">blasphemy"</span> against another. The contrast is between "blasphemy" against Christ as Son of man, Christ in his earthly work and under earthly conditions, the Christ whom they saw and whom they did not understand, and "blasphemy" against God as such working upon earth. "<span class="accented">Blasphemy"</span> against the former might be due to ignorance and prejudice, but "blasphemy" against the latter was to speak against God's work recognized as such, against God manifesting himself to their consciences (cf. vers. 27, 28); it was to reject the counsel of God towards them, to set themselves up in opposition to God, and thus to exclude from themselves forgiveness. Just as under the Law there were sacrifices for sins of ignorance and minor offences, but none for wilful disregard of and opposition to God, so must it be at all times even under the gospel itself. Observe that the "blasphemy" is understood by our Lord as showing the state of the heart (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). What the effect of a change of heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of repentance, would be does not enter into our Lord's utterance. All other sin is venial, but for heart-opposition there is no forgiveness. <span class="accented">As</span> Tyndale says ('Expositions,' p. 232, Parker Society), "<span class="accented">Sin</span> against the Holy Ghost is despising of the gospel and his working. Where that bideth is no remedy of sin: for it fighteth against faith, which is the forgiveness of sin. If that be put away, faith may enter in, and all sins depart." (Cf. also Dorner, ' System,' 3:73; 4:91.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Referring primarily to ver. 30, and to be joined closely to "I say unto you." Because such is the terrible effect of what you think mere indifferentism, I say this solemnly, Beware of committing the great sin. Luke's connexion of our ver. 43 with ver. 30 gives a good but a weaker sense - Become fully decided, lest the devil return to you stronger than ever. Matthew's connexion is - Become fully decided, for the legitimate outcome of want of decision is the sin that will not be forgiven. <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>,  note), <span class="cmt_word">All manner of;</span> <span class="accented">every</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Sin</span> <span class="cmt_word">and blasphemy.</span> Genus and species (Meyer). <span class="accented">Blasphemy</span> passes in this verse from its wider meaning of open slander and detraction in the first clause to its now commoner but restricted meaning of speech against God in the second clause. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</span>; <span class="accented">the Spirit</span> (Revised Version), thus making it more possible for the English reader to see the connexion of thought with the phrase in ver. 28. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be forgiven unto men.</span> The words, <span class="accented">unto men</span>, must be omitted, with the Revised Version.

This might be, comparatively speaking, innocuous if it was merely defamation or detraction of him as man; but if, on the other hand, it referred to his work in such a way as to mean a real detraction of God's actions considered as Divine, it indicated a state of feeling which did not admit of forgiveness (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). If it be asked whether the individual Pharisees referred to in vers. 24-28 had committed this sin, the answer depends upon whether they had recognized the hand of God as such, and had, notwithstanding, wilfully rejected it. If they had - as our Lord's tone seems to imply - then they had in fact committed it. Yet they may afterwards have repented, and so have come under a different category. <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> his birth, the circumstances of his life on earth, or his decisions respecting the sabbath or meats, or his disregard of the conventionalities of his time in his treatment of "sinners" and publicans.

Sometimes it was restricted to, or practically identified with, the reign of Messiah upon earth, but usually it included much more - eternity as well as time (see especially Weber, 'System,' pp. 354, 355; and cf. Schurer, II. 2:177). It is in its widest sense that our Lord here uses it - contrasting the present order of things with that which will be the final result of his coming, his thoughts travelling far beyond the present course of this world to that which is to be hereafter.

Notice that in <a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a> it is expressly attributed to others than those who had brought the accusation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Very similar verses are found in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a> (parallel passage: <a href="../../par/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a>); <a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a> agrees more verbally with the demand as described there than with our ver. 38. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Thus Mark and Luke relate such an incident once, but Matthew twice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The four passages (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38-42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16, 29-32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a>) contain so much similarity of language that we cannot suppose them to be absolutely independent of each other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Hence two hypotheses present themselves: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The demand was made twice (in itself exceedingly probable), and our Lord's answers were to a great extent identical in substance (in itself not very probable), and when identical in substance were closely identical in language (distinctly less probable). Or perhaps we might suppose that this identity of language was rather due to the narrator than to our Lord himself; familiarity with one answer may in the curly Church have moulded the record of the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The demand and the answer, as recorded, refer to one and the same occasion. But the account existed in more than one of the sources used by St. Matthew, and as each form of it had its own peculiarities (especially our ver. 24 and <a href="../../par/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2, 3</a>), he retained them both. Anyhow, <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a> seems to have belonged to the Framework, and our passage to the Discourses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> It will be noticed that all the passages except <a href="../../par/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a> speak of "the sign of Jonah." How was Jonah a sign? Our ver. 40 seems to answer the question, and to say that it was by being in the whale's belly three days and three nights. But there are serious difficulties in accepting this view as finally and alone right. For in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a> no explanation at all is recorded (though, indeed, it might be urged that the evangelist might fairly expect his readers to remember our ver. 40), and in <a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> apparently a different explanation is found, "for even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation" - words which, taken alone, would seem to refer to Jonah being a sign by the mere fact of his preaching. Thus our Lord would mean - As Jonah preached, so I preach. The future is used in <a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as bringing out  more clearly than the present would have done the final relation in which Christ should stand to his contemporaries. Godet, indeed, urges that the future excludes any present reference to Christ's work as preaching, and that the demand for a sign <span class="accented">from heaven</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>) can only be fully satisfied by Christ's resurrection, "in which no human agency intervenes, and in which Divine power appears alone." He, therefore, makes Luke's meaning identical with that of our ver. 40, and paraphrases thus: "It was as one who had miraculously escaped from death that Jonas presented himself before the Ninevites, summoning them to anticipate the danger which threatened them; it is as the Risen One that I (by my messengers) shall proclaim salvation to the men of this generation." But this would almost assume that Jonah told the Ninevites of his miraculous escape, though there is not a hint of his having done so. On the contrary, <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, implies that the call to repentance on the basis of punishment threatened was the sole and only means employed by the prophet to accomplish his mission. Jonah the preacher became, by virtue of his preaching, a sign to the Ninevites (for, quite apart from his miraculous preservation, his appearance in Nineveh and his preaching there were no small portent and sign of Divine interest in the Ninevites' affairs), and they accepted him. Matthew's addition, "the prophet," emphasizes this thought, even though he passes on to give what appears to have been the Lord's secondary interpretation of <span class="accented">the sign of Jonah.</span> Christ's primary object, then, in his reply was to show to his opponents that heathen Ninevites and a heathen queen accepted the truth without any such sign as that which they were now demanding, and, if possible, to shame them into doing so. Thus ver. 40 is to be considered as parenthetical rather than as the main subject. It has, indeed, been suggested that ver. 40 was in fact not spoken at all by the Lord himself, but is only the result of a very early interpretation by the Hebrew Christians of our Lord's phrase, added before the formation of our Gospel. The explanation is tempting, but, in the entire absence of corroboration, cannot be accepted (cf. note there). So far as our present evidence goes, we must attribute ver. 40 to Christ, and consider that as he was mentioning the reception of Jonah by the Ninevites, the thought occurred to him that in Jonah's history lay as it were a prefigurement of what he himself would be. Just as on another occasion he illustrated his death and resurrection by the figure of destroying and building the temple (<a href="../../par/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18, 19</a>), so now he uses the figure of Jonah in the whale's belly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> This is not the place to enter upon a discussion of the question whether the event here referred to literally happened or not, much less to examine the deep and mysterious subject of the Lord's kenosis (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). But it should be observed that some at least of those critics who do not believe that the narrative of Jonah being in the whale's belly is to be understood literally, consider that his preaching to the Ninevites at all is equally metaphorical (cf. C. H. H. Wright, 'Introduction to Old Testament,' p. 207, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>), <span class="accented">so</span> that not only ver. 40 but ver. 41 and <a href="../../par/luke/11-32.htm">Luke 11:32</a> are affected, and that indeed more seriously, since the Lord says that the Ninevites will stand up as witnesses. The reasons for taking the narrative as only metaphorical are far from convincing, yet even if they were overwhelming, the illustration in ver. 40 (though not ver. 41) would still remain valid, just as (with all reverence be it spoken) any one to-day might illustrate his action from that of one of Shakespeare's characters whose historical existence is more than doubtful. While, however, the frequency of the allegorical and pictorial in Hebrew poetry and prophecy must be fully allowed for, there seems to be no strong reason (apart from the miracle) to doubt the historical character of the narrative. Further, as to the miracle, <a href="../../par/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a> are so closely connected with <a href="../../par/jonah/1.htm">Jonah 1, 3</a>, and 4, that it is best to understand the writer as intending to represent it (marvellous though it is) as literal history. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-45.</span> - Some of our Lord's opponents try to defend themselves by asking for a sign of his authority to claim so much; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 30 (ver. 38). In his reply he refers them to their own histories for proof that such a demand is inexcusable. The Ninevites did not require one when Jonah became a sign to them - and in mentioning  Jonah he refers to his being in the whale's belly three days and three nights as a symbol of what should happen to himself - and "the queen of the south" took immense trouble to satisfy her craving after wisdom (vers. 39-42). Therefore let them beware; their present state was one of extreme danger; the improvement that they showed was only negative, and if they did not take care worse would happen to them in the future than in the past (vers. 43-45). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then certain</span>. The demand is only made by a portion of those present, who, according to <a href="../../par/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>, were not the same as those who spoke our ver. 24. <span class="cmt_word">Of the scribes and of the</span> (Revised Version omits <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Pharisees</span>.

Since, so far as the balance of evidence goes (cf., however, Bishop Westcott, 'Introduction,' p. 344, edit. 1872), the Crucifixion was on Friday and the Resurrection on Sunday, the actual time between them was only one clear day and two parts of days (which might fairly be called three days) and two whole nights. The reckoning, therefore, here is, strictly speaking, inaccurate. The words are perhaps a mere adaptation of the phrase in Jonah, and are here used only to roughly mark the time of our Lord's stay in the grave. Observe, however, that the addition of" nights" tends to emphasize the reality of our Lord's stay there. It was a matter of days and nights; he spent both kinds of earthly time "in the heart of the earth" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>, note). It will be noticed that the inaccuracy of the wording would, if modern Western habits were alone to be considered, make it most unlikely that the phrase is a later addition; but in view of the early Christian and Jewish method of illustrating events by passages of Scripture which do not apply in all respects, the improbability is not so great as would at first sight appear. However, upon our present information, we must say that the phrase was spoken by our Lord himself, and that although the exact time of his stay in the grave was well known to the early believers, they continued to repeat the saying in the form in which the Lord left it. In <span class="accented">the heart of the earth.</span> The form of the expression is derived from <a href="../../par/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a> (4), "in the heart of the seas" (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>), and would therefore appear to mean some deeper place than the rock-hewn sepulchre. Hence many commentators, beginning with Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' V. 31.) and Tertullian ('De Anima,' Iv.), understand it as directly denoting the place of departed spirits. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> ("the lower parts of the earth"), on the contrary, probably refers to the earth as such in contrast to heaven.

Interesting examples of such a method of instruction are to be seen in the Haggadoth (which are frequently parabolic narratives) of the Talmuds and other Jewish works. But both myth (cf. Alford) and parabolic Haggada share the common danger of being misunderstood as narratives which are intended to be taken literally, while in the parable, in the narrower sense of the word, such a confusion is hardly possible. For the narrative then suggests, either by its introduction or its structure, that it is only the mirror by which a truth can be seen, and is not the truth itself. Such parables also, though seldom even approaching in beauty to our Lord's, are very frequent in Jewish writings, though they come but seldom in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23-29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-40</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1-10</a>, which are rather allegories; and <a href="../../par/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-15</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>, which are fables). (On the distinction of parable in the narrower sense from fable, myth, proverb, allegory, see Alford and Trench.) Weiss ('Life,' 2:115) thinks that the most profound reason of all which the Lord had for employing parables was that he wished to show that the same regulations which hold good for the world round us and ourselves in relation to the world and each other, hold good also in the higher ethical and religious life. But at the most this can have been a very subsidiary motive with him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Behold, a sower.</span> Observe that our Lord enters upon his parable at once (contrast ver. 24). He will attract attention. Mark's "Hear ye" would have forwarded this. <span class="accented">A sower</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sower</span>, as the Revised Version; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sower of whom I am about to speak (cf.

The parable of the sower dealt with the first reception of the gospel; this deals with the after-development. The aim of this parable is to prevent over-sanguine expectations as to the purity of the society of believers, and to hinder rash attempts to purify it by merely external processes. Archbishop Benson ('Dict. of Christian Biogr.,' 1:745) calls attention to the fact that the first extant exposition of this parable is in Cyprian's successful appeal to the Novatianists not to separate from the Church (Ep. 54.). The aim of the somewhat similar parable in <a href="../../par/mark/4-26.htm">Mark 4:26-29</a> is to show the slowness and gradualness of the growth of the kingdom of heaven, and also the certainty of its consummation. So many words and phrases in the two parables are identical, that the possibility of one being derived from the other, either by omission or addition, must be acknowledged, but the definiteness of the aim in each points rather to their being originally two distinct parables. The divisions of the parable are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The fact of tares being present as well as good seed, and its cause (vers. 24-28<span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although there is the natural desire to gather out the tares at once, yet, on account of the impossibility of doing so without destroying some of the good seed, this must not be attempted.

Observe that we have no right to limit its growth either to the reputation of its principles alone or to the power of its organization; both are included. Regarded as a prophecy, the parable is partially fulfilled every time that a heathen  nation places itself under the protection of a Christian nation, and more truly fulfilled whenever a nation accepts Christianity as its own religion. It is parodied when a nation or a collection of nations submits its political freedom to the dictates of claimants to spiritual superiority, whether these claim to have received such superiority as an inheritance from the past, or to have acquired it in the present. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them</span> (ver. 24, note), <span class="cmt_word">saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto</span> (ver. 24, note; also <a href="../../par/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">a grain of mustard seed.</span> "The Common Mustard of Palestine is <span class="accented">Sinapis nigra</span>, of the order <span class="accented">Cruciferae</span>, the Black Mustard, which is found abundantly in a wild state, and is also cultivated in the gardens for its seed.

While our Lord thus promises that the permeating influence of the kingdom of heaven shall at last be entirely successful, it is unfair to so press the parable as to deduce from it that the world as such will continue to be gradually and continuously improved up to the Lord's return. It may be so (contrast, however, <a href="../../par/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>), but even direct prophecy, and still more parable, frequently regards the ultimate result, and passes over the intermediate stages. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34</a></div><div class="verse">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - The parallel passage in <a href="../../par/mark/4-33.htm">Mark 4:33, 34</a> is as follows: "And with  many such parables spoke he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it; and without a parable spoke he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things." The same general idea underlies our present verses, but although each evangelist appears to have used the same words as a basis, he has worked them out in his own characteristic way. For while both writers contrast our Lord's treatment of the multitudes and his treatment of the disciples in the matter of parables, St. Mark barely alludes to his using them as a judicial punishment upon the people, and St. Matthew merely hints here at the fact that Christ explained them to his disciples (see further, ver. 35<span class="accented">b</span>, note). It will be noticed that our verses have much in common with the thought of ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> It seems just possible that both paragraphs had one common nucleus from which they were each developed.

Dr. Herr ('Appendix') writes, "It is difficult not to think <span class="greek">&#x1f28;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> genuine. There was a strong temptation to omit it (cf. 27:9; Mc. Mark 1:2); and, though its insertion might be accounted for by an impulse to supply the name of the best known prophet, the evidence of the actual operation of such an impulse is much more trifling than might have been anticipated .... The erroneous introduction of Isaiah's name is limited to two passages, and in each case to a single Latin manuscript." If it be genuine, it is a parallel case to the reading "Jeremiah" instead of "Zechariah" in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>, for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been suggested. A simple error of memory (cf. Alford) on the part of one who shows himself so well acquainted with Hebrew customs and modes of thought as our evangelist does, is perhaps the most improbable of all solutions. Possibly, just as there were summaries of legal maxims current in our Lord's time (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a>, note), so there were in Hebrew-Christian circles well known sets of quotations from the Old Testament, which were not expressly divided one from another (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-18</a>), and which were ferreted <span class="accented">to under the name of the author of the best known passage.</span> (Observe that this would distinguish these summaries from liturgical quotations.) Thus Zechariah's mention of the potter (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-13.htm">Zechariah 11:13</a>) was placed in connexion with Jeremiah's visit to the potter's house, and with his warning of the possible rejection of Israel (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>; cf. 19:1-11); cf. further Pusey's remarks on the passage in Zechariah, and <a href="../../par/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (or perhaps 1-3), where Israel is bid listen to the lessons derived from their ancestors' behaviour, with the warning in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a> (cf. our vers. 34, 35 with ver. 14). We have an example of a similar connexion of passages in <a href="../../par/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2, 3</a>, where <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> is closely joined to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. Observe that if St. Mark had copied his source (<span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span>) to the end of the quotation from Malachi, and for some reason omitted the next quotation, he might very easily have still retained the name "Isaiah" with which he introduces his double quotation. Had he done so, we should have had another parallel to our present verse and <a href="../../par/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>. <span class="accented">The prophet.</span> If "Isaiah" be not genuine, this refers to "Asaph the seer" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>), who was the recognized author of the psalm.

But the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from of old") hardly, in the context of the psalm, refers further back than the be ginning of the national history of Israel, when the Israelites came out of Egypt. "Asaph...  here recounts to the people their history from that Egyptaeo-Sinaitic age of yore to which Israel's national indepen dence and specific position in relation to the rest of the world goes back He will set forth the history of the fathers after the manner of a parable and riddle, so that it may become as a parable, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a didactic history, and its events as marks of interrogation and nota benes to the present age" (Delitzsch). What, however, is the exact connexion of thought in the gospel between the passage as it stands, and its context? The first clause evidently corresponds in meaning to ver. 34; Christ fulfils in a fresh sense the expression of the psalmist by speaking in parables (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). But the second clause brings in a different thought, not found, save very indirectly, in ver. 34, namely, that Christ utters things that be fore were always hidden. What does the evangelist mean by this second clause? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Truths never before revealed have now been revealed by Christ's parables, especially by those two which have just been related. For in these it has been affirmed that outsiders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those belonging to other nations than the Jewish nation, shall seek the protection of the kingdom of heaven, and also that the whole world, including, therefore, these Gentile nations, shall become permeated with its principles. It may well be thought that the clause refers to the announcement of these great truths. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, if taken alone, is not enough. For the evangelist is not speaking of Christ revealing truths to men generally. On the contrary, he says that Christ does not reveal them to the multi tudes, but to his disciples (cf. ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>) - a contrast which the emphatic language of ver. 34 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) would probably suggest, even though it is not expressly mentioned. It is, therefore, likely that it was this latter fact to which the evangelist specially wished to refer by his quotation of the second clause. Hence, to make his meaning clearer, he has modified its language. As he quotes it, not merely "enigmatical sayings," but "things hidden" (and that from the foundation of the world) are uttered by Christ; but these are now no longer "hidden" to those to whom he speaks them. This complete meaning of the clause - revelation to his disciples of truths before hidden - corresponds to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11 (where see note) and in St. Paul (cf. especially <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>), and is merely another side of St. Mark's phrase, "Privately to his own disciples he expounded all things" (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 16, 17). It is also possible that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which is not merely negative, so as to mean "unrevealed," but implies a positive concealment, includes a reference to the thought of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, that God purposely hid these truths from those who were morally unfit to receive them. These, indeed, belonged in general to the times before Christ came, but also "the multitudes" came under this category. If it be asked - What is the relation of the quotation in its context here to the verse in its original context? the easiest answer is that it is only superficial, that the "accidental" employment by the psalmist of the word "parable" was the only reason why the evangelist made the quotation. Yet it may not be quite so; for there was a real similarity between the psalmist teaching his contemporaries by history and Christ teaching his contemporaries by truths couched in narrative form. May we not go even further, and say that in both cases the message was, generally speaking, refused, though in both a remnant of those who heard it were saved (cf also <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-13</a>; <span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">?</span>

It is possible that our Lord chose the term in order to accustom his disciples to the idea of carrying on the study of Divine things which the scribes were accustomed to make. Even if the disciples were not to follow their methods they might well imitate their devotion Dean Plumptre has an interesting note on our Lord's comparison of his own work and that of the apostles after him, to the work of the scribes of the Jewish schools.

It is curious that the thought of <a href="../../par/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33, 34</a> should also resemble our vers. 47-50. <span class="cmt_word">Things new and old.</span> The thought of the saying is that as a householder brings out from his stores food recently and long ago acquired (cf. <a href="../../par/songs/7-13.htm">Song of Solomon 7:13</a>), so a Christian "scribe" brings out (primarily, if not solely, for the use of others) the new truths that he learns, and also old ones that he has long since known. It is thus a promise that the disciples shall (if they use their opportunities rightly) be able to do more than understand Christ's teaching (as they have just claimed to have done); for they shall be able to teach (not merely to learn), and that not only new truths, but also old ones; they shall be able, that is to say, to understand the relation of the old to the new, and to bring out even the old in its true meaning, Hence <span class="accented">old</span> is mentioned after <span class="accented">new</span>, for it implies greater knowledge and skill. It will be observed that Irenaeus' interpretation (IV. 9:1) of <span class="accented">new and old</span> as the New and Old Testaments is only partially right. With the disciples, it is true, the <span class="accented">old</span> would naturally be, in the first place, Old Testament truths, and the <span class="accented">new</span>, such truths as they learned from Christ; but these also would, after a few weeks or months, in their turn become old to them, and the fresh truths taught them as their life went on would be ever the new ones. The thought of <a href="../../par/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7, 8</a> is very similar. Weiss' interpretation is different and even less right. According to him, <span class="accented">new</span> represents the truths about the kingdom of God, and <span class="accented">old</span> the long known arrangements of nature and human life, which, as the parables show, are drawn up on the same hues. Origen gives a beautiful application of <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-10.htm">Leviticus 26:10, 11</a><span class="accented">a</span>.

Hence many critics (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald; Schurer, I. 2:22) suppose the account in Matthew and Mark to be mistaken, and due to a confusion of Herodias with her daughter.

Besides, Herod the son of Mariamne would probably have had some other name than that of his father alone.

He walks on the water and stays the storm. St. Peter's attempt to walk on the water is successful so long as he exercises faith on Christ. Jesus receives homage as Messiah. Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45-52</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15-21</a>. It is strange that the incident of St. Peter is recorded in Matthew only, and not in Mark, for it serves to emphasize what is a leading thought of the preceding narrative, even in Mark, viz. the power that believers receive by virtue of faith on Christ (vers. 16, 19). With Christ in the boat, difficulties cease (ver. 32); they that believe on him can triumph as he did (vers. 28-31; cf. the thought of <a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>, end). For St. John's purpose the mention of St. Peter was not necessary; since, by way of introduction to the following discourse, be desired rather to familiarize his readers with the idea of Christ's body being triumphant over earthly limitations (cf. ver. 19, note). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples.</span> It was not their wish to leave him, especially when the multitudes seemed likely to elect him king (<a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). But from the temptation to side with the multitudes our Lord desired now to shield them. Separation and physical work (ver. 24) would calm their excitement, and the object lesson that their Master already ruled over wind and sea would lead them to more perfect trust in his methods. Another reason for his sending them forward may have been that they should use the failing light; and yet another, that he himself desired time for prayer. <span class="cmt_word">To get into a ship;</span> <span class="accented">a boat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a> (<span class="accented">the boat</span>, Revised Version, reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And to go before him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="../../par/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>).

Open houses and food partaken of in public allowed this close observation without any infringement of Eastern courtesy. They come to Christ with the insidious question, because they consider him answerable for his disciples' doings (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a>). They imply that his teaching has led to thee transgression on which they animadvert. Doubtless the apostles, from Christ's instruction and example, were learning to free themselves from the endless rules and restrictions which were no help to religion, and to attend more to the great realities of vital piety and holiness. The omission of the outward acts, rabbinically enjoined, was readily marked and censured. <span class="cmt_word">The tradition.</span> This formed a vast collection of additions, explanations, etc., of the original Law, partly, as was affirmed, delivered orally by Moses, and handed down from generation to generation; and partly accumulated by successive expounders. St. Paul refers to this when he speaks of himself before his conversion as being "exceedingly jealous for the tradition or my fathers" (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>). From it, in the course of time. was formed the Talmud, with its text (Mishna) and its commentary (Gemara). It was not put into writing till after our Lord's time  (hence called <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), but was taught authoritatively by accredited teachers who, while retaining the letter of the Law abrogated its spirit, nullifying the broad line of God's commandments by enforcing minute observances and puerile restrictions which were a burden and impediment to purity and devotion, rather than an aid and encouragement. <span class="cmt_word">The elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">the ancients.</span> The older expositors and rabbis, whose commentaries had been orally handed down..

To <span class="accented">eat bread</span> means to take food of any kind. The fear of legal defilement led to a multitude of rabbinical rules of the most vexatious and troublesome nature, the infringement of any of which endangered a man's ceremonial purity (see <a href="../../par/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3, 4</a>). These frivolous regulations had been built upon the plain Mosaical enactments of <a href="../../par/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, etc. St. Matthew, writing for those who were well acquainted with these glosses, enters into no details; St. Mark is more explicit. It is to be remarked that the Pharisees were extending and enforcing these traditions just when the Law was to be superseded by something more spiritual and doing so in spite of the interdiction "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>).

His non-observance of these minutiae showed their unimportance, and called attention to the inward purity which they typified, and which could be maintained without these external ceremonies. At the same time, Jesus does not condemn such symbolical acts, even as he himself washed the disciples' feet before the last Supper. The evil in rabbinical teachings was that it superseded the spiritual view, and placed outward cleansing on a higher level than inward holiness. <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with accusative); <span class="accented">on account of</span>, in order to maintain. <span class="cmt_word">Your tradition.</span> Tradition which is emphatically yours and not God's, a human gloss, not a revealed command.

Christ cites the fifth commandment, because it more especially appealed to the conscience of every one, and was emphasized by the solemn enactment of death as the penalty of its infringement (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>).

In Ecclus. 38:1, "Honour a physician with the honours due unto him," the expression has reference to his proper fees, the <span class="accented">honorarium</span> paid for his services. In God's view honour to parents is not shown only in outward salutations, obedience, and respect, but also in material assistance, help provided for their needs, alms freely bestowed when necessary. This well known signification makes the tradition next given more inexcusable. <span class="cmt_word">Die the death.</span> An Hebraism, equivalent to "shall surely be put to death" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, margin).

The vow to consecrate his savings, even at death, to the temple absolved a man from the duty of succouring his parents. It was further ruled that if a son, from any motive whatever, pronounced any aid to his parents to be corban, he was thenceforward precluded from affording them help, the claims of the commandment and of natural affection and charity being superseded by the vow. He seems to have been allowed to expend the money thus saved on himself or any other object except his father and mother. So gross an evasion of a common duty could not be placed in the same category as the omission of unnecessary washings.

The last clause is not in the Greek; it is supplied by our translators, as it was in Coverdale's version, to complete the apodosis. There are various methods of translating the passage. Retaining <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> at the beginning of the sentence, some make these words the continuation of the gloss, "Whosoever shall say," etc., the apodosis being found in the sentence following. Others conceive an aposiopesis after "be profited by me," as if Christ refrained from pronouncing the hypocritical and indeed blasphemous words which completed the gloss. In this case the apodosis follows  in ver. 6, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">then such a one will not honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>), etc. The words are best taken as put into the Pharisees' mouth in the sense, "The man under those circumstances shall not honour," etc.; he is free from the obligation of helping his parents. The form of the sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with the future verb) is prohibitory rather than predictive, and implies, "he is forbidden to honour." Christ thus sharply emphasizes the contradiction between God's Law and man's perversion thereof. St. Mark has, "Ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father." Thus; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> in the apodosis, removing the full stop before it in the Authorized Version.

Septuagint, "In vain do they worship me, teaching men's commandments and doctrines." Their worship is vitiated at its very root. <span class="cmt_word">Commandments of men.</span> This is Christ's designation of rabbinical traditions (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-22.htm">Colossians 2:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He called the multitude.</span> Jesus had now finally broken with the Pharisaical party; he had carried the war into their camp. It was necessary that those who had followed these false teachers should know, on the one hand, to what irreligion, immorality, and profanity their doctrines led, and, on the other, should learn the unadulterated truth, "pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father." So he calls around him the crowd of common people, who from respect had stood aloof during the previous controversy, and teaches them a great moral truth which concerns every human being. <span class="cmt_word">Hear, and understand.</span> The distinction which he was about to enunciate was difficult for persons trained in Pharisaical dogmas to receive and understand; he therefore calls special attention to his coming words. The depreciation of ceremonial cleansings might easily be misunderstood. Jesus would say - There is indeed cleansing necessary for all men; but it does not consist in outward washings, but in inward holiness. In what follows, our Lord says nothing definitely about the distinction between clean and unclean meats laid down in the Mosaic Law; he would only show that impurity in the moral sense came from within. This is leading up to the principle enunciated by the apostle, "Every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man.</span> The word rendered "defileth" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>) means "renders common," in opposition to <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to separate" for God's use; hence the verb, ethically applied, signifies "to contract guilt." The rabbis taught that certain meats of themselves polluted the soul, made it abominable in God's sight. This was a perversion of the law respecting clean and unclean food. The pollution or guilt arose, not from the nature of the meat, but from the eating of it in contravention of a positive command. It was the disobedience, not the food, which affected the soul. It is remarkable that these distinctions of meats still obtain among half the civilized inhabitants of the world - Buddhists, Hindoos, Mohammedans - and that one of the hardest tasks of Christian missionaries is to make men understand the non-importance of these differences. We do not see that Christ here abrogated the Levitical Law, but he certainly prepared the way for its supersession and transformation. But he made no sudden and violent change in the  constituted order of things. Indeed, some distinctions were maintained in apostolical times, as we read in <a href="../../par/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>; and it was only gradually, and as circumstances made their observation impossible, that such ceremonial obligations were regarded as obsolete. It is, perhaps, with the view of not shocking inveterate prejudice, that he does not say, "No food whatever defileth," but "That which goeth into the mouth" defileth not, referring especially to the notion above reprehended, that eating with unwashen hands polluted the food taken and the soul of the person who consumed it. Our Lord says nothing of excess, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> gluttony and drunkenness, which, of course, has a polluting and deteriorating effect on the moral nature (see <a href="../../par/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But that which cometh out of the mouth</span>. In the former sentence the mouth is regarded simply as the instrument for receiving food and preparing it for digestion; in this sentence it is considered as the organ of the heart, that which gives outward expression to inward thoughts and conceptions. Fillion distinguishes them as "la bouche physique, et la bouche morale." Philo has well said, "The mouth is that by which, as Plato puts it, mortal things enter, and whence immortal things issue. For therein pass meat and drink, the perishable food of a perishable body; but from it proceed words, immortal laws of an immortal soul, by which the rational life is directed and governed" ('De Mundi Opif.,' &sect; 40). <span class="cmt_word">Defileth a man.</span> Pollutes his soul, not with merely ceremonial defilement, but intrinsically and morally. Of course, our Lord is referring to evil words, etc., as he explains in ver. 19. For the mouth may give utterance to God's praise, words of love, sympathy, edification. But the evil in a man's heart will show itself in his mouth; and the open expression will react on the wicked thought, and make it more substantial, deadly, and operative.

In their view, spiritualization of any of its enactments was equivalent to its subversion. But, as St. Gregory observes, "If offence arises from the statement of the truth, it is more expedient that offence be permitted to arise than that the truth should be abandoned" ('Hom. 7. in Ezek.').

Christ, as often, puts the statement in a parabolic form, using two images, one derived from the vegetable kingdom in this verse, and one from human life in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_word">Plant</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">plantation.</span> The act of planting, and then by metonymy the thing planted. It here signifies the sect and doctrine of the Pharisees, the persons themselves, and that which they taught. The comparison of men and trees, plant and doctrine, is a common biblical metaphor (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43, 44</a>, etc.). The traditions of the rabbis were plants <span class="cmt_word">which my heavenly</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father hath not planted.</span> They were of human, not Divine, growth; and the men themselves, even though originally planted in holy soil, had degenerated, and become not only unfruitful, but pernicious. So the Lord speaks by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), "I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" <span class="cmt_word">Shall be rooted up.</span> Our Lord is not referring to the judgment of the last day (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>), nor to any forcible destruction effected by human agency; he means that the system must pass away entirely to make room for a better growth, even the gospel. The Jews would not see that the Law was a schoolmaster to bring men to Christ; they deemed that their ceremonies and rites were to be permanent and universal; and this, more than anything, impeded the reception of Christ's claims, and made men utterly averse from his teaching. It was in vain that Jesus proclaimed, "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me" (<a href="../../par/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>). The very Law, as handled and obscured by the Pharisees, was made an obstacle to the truth.

The "ditch" in one sense is unbelief in Christ, to which rabbinical teaching undoubtedly led. In another sense it adumbrates the ruin in which these false principles would involve the Jewish polity and people. It is obvious that the rejection of the Messiah drew down the punishment which has made the Hebrew nation an astonishment to all the world.

The word in an extended sense is used of any hard, enigmatical saying or figurative expression. The term here is applied to the statement in ver. 11. The apostles did not comprehend the minimizing of the rules concerning purification, and the possibility of a man being defiled by what proceeded from his mouth. Inveterate prejudices die hard, and it is difficult to emancipate one's self from old modes of thought.

Up to the very last they failed to apprehend his mission; nor was it till the Day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured upon them, that they really and in fulness understood the Lord's teaching and their own duties and powers.

It has nothing to do with the heart or the moral being; it affects only the material organization, and has no connection with the spiritual. Christ does not concern himself with questions, which modern philosophers would attempt to solve, concerning the mutual influence of soul and body, the animal and spiritual nature; he puts forth an argument which every one could receive, plain even to those "without understanding." This is the elucidation of the first part of ver. 11. The further explanation follows in vers. 18, 19. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those things.</span> He does not assert that everything which issues from a man's mouth defiles him; for, as was said above on ver. 11, many good things may come from a man's mouth; but he means that the evil to which he gives utterance is fraught with pollution to his moral nature. <span class="cmt_word">From the heart.</span> The heart stands for soul, mind, spirit, will, the whole inner man, that which makes him what he is, a conscious, intelligent, responsible being.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a></div><div class="verse">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of the heart proceed.</span> The shameful catalogue which follows is less full than that in St. Mark, which contains thirteen items, while this consists of seven only.

Some would translate the words, "evil machinations." But there is no need to change the usual rendering, which is very appropriate here. Evil thoughts are the preparation of all other sins, and have a pernicious influence on the character. We are very much what we think. That on which our minds are fixed, that which is the chief object presented to our inward sight, shapes our disposition and life. High and noble thoughts elevate and purify; low and mean thoughts debase and pollute. The wickedness in a man springs from within; he is guilty of it. If he admits the tempter, succumbs to his seductions, it is his own will that is in fault, encouraging the evil imagination, and not at once resisting, abhorring, and repelling it. Well may we pray, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me" (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>); and remember the wise man's injunction, "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The enumeration follows more or less closely the second table of the Decalogue. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-20.htm">Matthew 15:20</a></div><div class="verse">These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Thus Jesus sums up what has been said, and recalls the circumstance which led to the discourse, emphatically repeating his judgment on the Pharisaical gloss.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28.</span> - <span class="accented">Healing of the daughter of the Canaanitish woman.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24-30</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went thence.</span> Jesus left the place, probably Capernaum, where the above discourse had been held, and where it was no longer safe for him to remain. He had grievously offended the dominant party by his outspoken words concerning purity and defilement; therefore, to escape any premature violence, he <span class="cmt_word">departed</span> to a more secure quarter. <span class="cmt_word">Into the coasts</span> (<span class="greek_word">ta\ me/rh</span>, "the parts") <span class="cmt_word">of Tyre and Sidon.</span> The word "coasts" here, ver. 22, and elsewhere, does not mean "seacoasts," but "borders." The Authorized Version conveys a wrong impression by its use of the word. These two cities lay on the coast of Galilee, and had never been really conquered by the Israelites, though allotted to the tribe of Asher. There was no very exact limitation of territory between Phoenician (of which they were the capitals) and Jewish land, but there was a great moral distinction. The Phoenicians were sunk in the grossest idolatry; the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth reigned among them with all its depravity and pollution. Whether our Lord actually entered this district, or only approached its confines, is a matter of dispute. The language in the two extant accounts is ambiguous, and might be taken to imply either proceeding. But we cannot suppose that Christ betook himself to the close neighbourhood of those evil towns. His injunction to the apostles, when he sent them on their missionary tour, to abstain from going into any way of the Gentiles or entering any Samaritan city (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>), and his own declaration which shortly follows, that he was sent to the house of Israel, alike preclude the idea that he ever passed beyond the boundaries of the Holy Land. The woman, too, who appealed to him is said to have "come out away from those borders" - an expression which could hardly have been used if Christ had at this time been within them. And that he did no mighty work in these Phoenician cities may be gathered from his denunciation of Chorazin and Bethsaida for not showing the appreciation of his power and mercy which these centres of heathendom would have exhibited had they been equally favoured (see <a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>). If, as Chrysostom suggests, Jesus, by going to these partly Gentile districts, wished to give a practical commentary on the abrogation of the distinction between clean and unclean (breaking down the wall of partition between Jew and Gentile), this lesson was given equally well by the acceptance and commendation of the Gentile woman's faith, even though Christ himself was outside of pagan territory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>. The word marks the sudden and unexpected character of the incident. <span class="cmt_word">A woman of Canaan.</span> She belonged to the accursed race of Canaan, the ancient inhabitants of the land, doomed, indeed, to destruction, but never thoroughly extirpated. St. Mark calls her "a Greek," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Gentile, and "a Syro-Phoenician," which explains her proper nationality. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the same coasts.</span> Some join these words with "a woman;" but came out would still imply that she left her own territory to meet Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on me.</span> She speaks as though she herself were the one that needed healing, identifying herself with her diseased daughter, as though the horrible incubus lay upon her own spirit and could not be relieved without the cure of the suffering girl. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord,</span> thou <span class="cmt_word">Son of David</span>. Living among a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles, she had heard this title applied to Jesus; she knew something of the hopes of the Hebrew nation, that they were expecting a Messiah, son of the great King David, who should preach to the poor and heal the sick, as she heard that Jesus had done. We know that the reputation of Jesus had spread into these parts, and that persons from this country had come to him to be healed (<a href="../../par/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). There is no reason to suppose that the woman was a proselyte; but evidently she was of a humble and religious spirit, open to conviction, and of an enlightened understanding, which needed only grace and instruction to ripen into faith. At present she saw in Christ only a merciful Wonder-worker - an error which he often combated, and which now by his conduct he corrected. <span class="cmt_word">My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span> She must have learned from her Hebrew neighbours to attribute her child's malady to demoniacal influence, as such an idea would not have naturally occurred to a heathen Greek. The power of the devil was shown more openly in heathen localities. We do not read of many bad cases of possession in strictly Jewish districts. It is in Gentile or semi-Gentile regions that the worst instances occur; and while the pagan inhabitants attributed the mysterious maladies to natural causes, the truer insight of believers assigned them, and often most justly, to spiritual agencies. In the present case, the possession must have been unconnected with any ethical relations. It was not that the child, by any act of her own, had put herself into the demon's power. We must regard it, like the sufferings of innocent infants, as a providential arrangement which God for wise purposes allows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-23.htm">Matthew 15:23</a></div><div class="verse">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Answered her not a word.</span> The woman made no specific request; she had not brought the sufferer with her, and  entreated Christ to exorcise the evil influence; she did not urge him to go to her house, and by his gracious presence work a cure. Simply she tells her affliction, and lets the woeful tale plead for itself. But there was no response. The Merciful is obdurate; the Physician withholds his aid; in the face of misery, to the voice of entreaty, the Lord is silent. It is the discipline of love; he acts as though he hears not, that he may bring forth perseverance and faith. <span class="cmt_word">Send her away.</span> There is some doubt concerning the feeling of the apostles in thus addressing Christ. Did they wish him to grant her virtual petition or not? On the one hand, it is urged that they were thoroughly annoyed at her importunity. They had sought for quiet' and privacy, and now this woman was bringing a crowd around them, and occasioning the very notoriety which they wished to avoid. Their Jewish prejudices, too, were aroused by this appeal from a Canaanite; they could not endure the idea that favour should be extended to this Gentile of an abhorred race; hence they desire Christ to dismiss her at once, give her a decided rejection. On the other hand, the answer of Christ to their request leads to another explanation, as if he understood them to be asking him to grant her prayer. And this is undoubtedly what they did want, though they did not presume to prescribe the manner or to beg for a miracle. They range themselves on the woman's side, not from any genuine compassion, but from mere selfishness. The ground of their appeal is, <span class="cmt_word">She crieth after us.</span> The appeal had been first made in the open street, and the Canaanite had followed them, as they moved, continuing her piteous cry, and thus attracting attention to them and defeating their hope of retirement and rest. So they, for their own peace and comfort, ask Christ to grant the prayer of this obstinate suppliant: "Give her what she wants, and have done with her." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a></div><div class="verse">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am</span> (<span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel</span>. Doubtless the woman had listened to the apostles' intercession, and thought her cause won; but the repulse is only repeated; this Gentile is beyond the sphere of his mission; he cannot help her without departing from the rule which he had set himself. Jesus says nothing here about the rejection of the Jews and the future ingathering of the Gentiles; he states merely that his personal mission while he was on earth was confined to the Hebrew nation. He was, as St. Paul calls him (<a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>), "a Minister of the circumcision." Later, he would send others to evangelize those who were now aliens from the chosen commonwealth; at present he has come unto his own possessions. <span class="cmt_word">Lost sheep.</span> There is a tenderness in this expression natural from the mouth of the good Shepherd. He had used it when he sent forth the twelve on their apostolical journey (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>); the metaphor is found in the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>, etc.) It is appropriate here, where he is emphasizing his attitude towards the chosen people, and teaching the Canaanitish woman the relative position of Jew and Gentile. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-25.htm">Matthew 15:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came she and worshipped him.</span> Meantime, as we learn from St. Mark, Jesus had left the street and entered into a house. The woman, nothing daunted by her rebuff and the disregard with which her appeal was received, followed him persistently, and, growing bolder in her importunity, fell as a suppliant at his feet. While he still seemed to repulse her, she was learning fresh faith and hope. <span class="cmt_word">Lord, help me.</span> She does not now call him "Son of David." She begins to feel that she has little claim upon him as the Jewish Messiah; she appeals rather to his mercy and his power. Still, she identifies herself, as at first, with her daughter; the only boon she wants for herself is her child's relief. "For she indeed (my daughter) is insensible of her disease, but it is I that suffer her innumerable woes; my disease is with consciousness, my madness with perception of itself" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. 52 in S. Matt.'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a></div><div class="verse">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i>it</i> to dogs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he answered and said.</span> At length Jesus spoke directly to her; but his words were rough in sound, still enforcing the previous repulse. <span class="cmt_word">It is not meet;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">non est bonum</span> (Vulgate). Another reading of less authority is <span class="accented">oboe</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "it is not lawful." The question is rather of fairness and expediency than of lawfulness. <span class="cmt_word">To take the children's bread.</span> "The children" are the chosen people, "the children of the kingdom" (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>), who held this high position by election, however individuals might forfeit it by an unworthy use of privileges. "Bread" is meant to signify the graces and favours bestowed by God in Christ. <span class="cmt_word">To cast it.</span> An humiliating term; not to give it, as you would to your children, but to throw it away as valueless, fit only for animals. <span class="cmt_word">Dogs</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). A contemptuous diminutive, rendered by Wickliffe, "whelpies," or, as we might say, "curs." This was the term applied by the Jews to the Gentiles, even as Turks nowadays talk of "dogs of Christians," and as in later times, by a curious inversion, the Jews themselves were generally saluted with the opprobrious name of"dogs." Some have seen a term of endearment in the diminutive "little dogs," as though Christ desired to soften the harshness of the expression by referring, not to the prowling, unowned animals that act  as scavengers in Oriental towns, but to the petted inmates of the master's house. But Scripture gives no warrant for thinking that the Hebrews ever kept dogs as friends and companions, in our modern fashion; and our Lord adopts the language of his countrymen, to put the woman in her right position, as one with whom Jews could have no fellowship. To take the blessings from the Church of Israel in order to give them to aliens was to throw them away on unworthy recipients. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-27.htm">Matthew 15:27</a></div><div class="verse">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Truth, Lord;</span> or better, <span class="accented">but she said, Yea, Lord</span> (Revised Version). Christ's answer might have seemed the climax of rejection, and to have at once closed the matter forever. But her love for her daughter, and her growing faith in Jesus, overcame all seeming hindrances. With a woman's ready wit, quickened by urgency and affection, she seizes the opportunity, and turns Christ's own words against himself. Thou sayest truth, she means; the Jews are the children; we are the dogs; and as dogs we claim our portion. This we can receive without defrauding the children of any of their food. <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">for even</span>; <span class="accented">nam et</span> (Vulgate). The Authorized Version injures the significance of the mother's reply, as if there were something adversative in the particles, which really introduce the confirmation of her assent. <span class="cmt_word">The dogs eat of the crumbs,</span> etc. Dogs in the East have access to the rooms, and live on what they can pick up or on what is thrown to them. The fragments at meals were naturally numerous, the abundance being occasioned by the nature of the food, the use of fingers instead of spoons and forks, and the employment of pieces of bread as platters and napkins. We may paraphrase the Canaanite's reply thus: By calling us dogs, you virtually grant what I desire. You can do what I wish without infringing your rule, in the justice of which I humbly acquiesce. I claim nothing as a daughter of Abraham; I look only for uncovenanted mercies; I ask only for that portion which falls to the lot of the creatures which hold the lowest place in the household, and the loss of which will never be felt. Truly by humbling her Jesus educated her, taught her that her real plea was her unworthiness, that in acknowledgment of her degradation lay the force of her appeal. And in asking for this one act of mercy she is doing no wrong to the sons of the house. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-28.htm">Matthew 15:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great <i>is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O woman, great is thy faith.</span> Jesus had often to complain of unbelief in his hearers; at no man's faith did he ever express surprise, except in the case of another Gentile, the centurion of Capernaum (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-10.htm">Matthew 8:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</span> She had conquered; she gained her wish. But we must not think that Christ consented because his human feelings were overcome by her importunity, like the unjust judge in the parable, though the principle and teaching of that parable were here beautifully illustrated. He acted all the time as God, who foreknew what he would do. He had been leading her up to this climax; he had willed to give her an opportunity of exhibiting this trust and sell-command and unfailing confidence, and now he crowns her with his mighty eulogium, and grants her request, rewarding her great faith by a great mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Her daughter was made whole.</span> St. Mark reports the words of Christ, "For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter." He does not say, "I will come and heal her;" he tells her that the cure is already effected. Without personal contact with the sufferer, without any command uttered to the possessing demon, by his silent will alone the wonder comes to pass. This blessing for the child was won by the mother's faith. The two points to be remarked in this marvellous history are - Christ's abnormal treatment of a suppliant, and that suppliant's astonishing faith and perseverance. Both of these subjects have been noticed in the course of the Exposition.

The people seized the opportunity of listening to his teaching and profiting by his superhuman power. <span class="cmt_word">Having with them.</span> The catalogue of sufferers that follows represents accurately the sight that meets one in Oriental towns and villages, where the absence of medical appliances and the general want of surgical treatment render slight maladies or injuries chronic and inveterate, and fill the streets with persons in all stages of disease.  <span class="cmt_word">Maimed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">debiles</span> (Vulgate). In <a href="../../par/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a> the word means "deprived of a member;" but it has been doubted whether our Lord ever exerted his creative power to replace an absent limb. In the case of Malchus the ear probably was not wholly severed from the skull, but was still attached thereto by a fragment of flesh or skin, and no fresh creation was needed. We may well understand the word to signify "deformed," or deprived of the use of hand or foot. The Arabic Version renders it "dried up," or "withered." <span class="cmt_word">Cast them down.</span> The expression implies the precipitancy With which their friends offered the sufferers to Christ's notice, appealing to his mercy and relying on his power - not with careless abandonment, but with an earnest rivalry to be first attended to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-31.htm">Matthew 15:31</a></div><div class="verse">Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The maimed to be whole.</span> This clause is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and some other manuscripts, the Vulgate and other versions, and some modern editors. Probably the difficulty mentioned above led to its being first obelized and then rejected. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Israel</span>. Jehovah, whose covenanted mercies they were enjoying. St. Matthew is careful on all occasions to exhibit Jesus as the Messenger and Representative of the God of the Old Testament. The apostles, as Alford suggests, might joyfully contrast this abundance of acts of mercy with the great difficulty with which a Gentile's faith had lately obtained help. "Seest thou," says St. Chrysostom, "how the woman indeed he healed with so much delay, but these immediately? not because these are better than she is, but because she is more faithful than they. Therefore, while in her case he defers and delays, to manifest her constancy, on these he bestows the gift immediately, stopping the mouths of the unbelieving Jews, and cutting away from them every plea. For the greater favour one hath received, so much more is he liable to punishment, if he be insensible, and the very honour makes him no better." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his disciples</span> unto him. Seeing the necessities of the multitude, Jesus, as it were, takes his disciples into council, treating them not as servants, but as friends. They were doubtless dispersed among the crowd, and Jesus summons them around him, and puts before them the special point to which his attention is turned. Thus he tries their faith, and shows that there were no human means available for feeding these famishing people. Thus God, so to speak, takes Abraham into his confidence before visiting the iniquity of Sodom: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have compassion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">on</span> <span class="cmt_word">the multitude</span>. The human heart of Jesus felt for these distressed followers; his perfect sympathy was aroused in their behalf. We observe references to this tender feeling in many other instances (see <a href="../../par/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-34.htm">Matthew 20:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13</a>.

The three days, according to the Hebrew formula of computation, would consist of one whole day and parts of two others. Thus constantly employed in healing and teaching, Jesus thinks not of himself; his whole care is centred on the people who, in their anxiety to see and hear him, forget their own necessities. There would be nothing strange in the people camping out for a night in Palestine. Men and women ordinarily lie down to rest in the clothes which they have worn during the day, and need no special preparation for sleeping. Thus a man covers himself with his heavy outer garment, lies on the dry ground, like Jacob at Bethel, with a stone or his arm for a pillow, and sleeps comfortably and safely till awakened by the morning sun. <span class="cmt_word">I wilt not send them away fasting.</span> Like a good master of a household, in his tender pity, Christ takes the circumstances of the multitude into consideration, and cannot endure the idea of dismissing them wearied and unfed to find their way to their own homes, which, as St. Mark adds, were, in the case of many of them, at a long distance. <span class="cmt_word">Faint</span>. Travellers tell us that out of the motley crowd of pilgrims that flock to Jerusalem at Easter-tide, many run short of provisions and perish on the road. Christ's thoughtful care regards the possibility of such disaster, and prepares the remedy. He had treated the sicknesses of the multitude; he had instructed their ignorance; now he will feed their bodies. They had sought nothing from him, nor begged for food; probably they had no idea of looking to him to supply their want. But they who follow Jesus shall never lack. They were seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and temporal blessings were added to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-33.htm">Matthew 15:33</a></div><div class="verse">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whence should we have so much bread</span>, etc.? Christ had said nothing to his disciples concerning his design of feeding the people, but his remarks pointed to the possibility of such a design, and the apostles at once throw cold water upon the project. They do not indeed, as they did before urge him to send the multitude away, that they may supply their own needs, but  they emphasize the impossibility of carrying out the idea of feeding them. Their answer bristles with objections. The place is uninhabited; the multitude is numerous; the quantity of food required is enormous; and how can <span class="accented">we</span>, poor and needy as we are, help them? It seems to us incredible that they could return this answer, after having, net very long before, experienced the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand. They seemed now to have forgotten the earlier marvel, and to be in utter doubt how the necessary food was to be provided on the present occasion. That Christ would display his miraculous powers appears not to have crossed their minds. Such surprising forgetfulness and slowness of faith have seemed to some critics so unlikely and unusual, that they have regarded the apostles' attitude as confirming their assumption of the identity of the two miracles of feeding. But really such conduct is true to human nature. Calvin, while he condemns in vehement terms the disciples' dulness - "nimis brutum produnt stuporem" - is careful to add that men are always liable to a similar insensibility, prone to forget past deliverance in the face of present difficulty. Immediately after the passage of the Red Sea, the people feared that they would perish of thirst in the wilderness; and when God promised to give them flesh to eat, even Moses doubted the possibility of the supply, and asked whence it could be provided (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>, etc.). How often did Jesus speak of his sufferings, death, and resurrection! And yet these events came upon believers as a surprise for which they were altogether unprepared. Continually the disciples forgot what they ought to have remembered, drew no proper inferences from what they had seen and experienced, and had to be taught the same lessons repeatedly under different circumstances. Since the first miraculous meal many events had happened; often possibly they had been in want of food, as when on the sabbath day they appeased their hunger with ears of corn plucked by the way, and Christ had worked no miracle for their relief. It did not immediately suggest itself to them to have recourse to their Master in the emergency; they were very far from expecting Divine interposition at every turn. If they thought at all of the former miracle, they may have looked upon it as the outcome of an intermittent power, not always at command, or at any rate not likely to be exercised on the present occasion. They were slow to apprehend Christ's Divine mission and character. The acknowledgment of his Messiahship did net necessarily connote the realization of his Godhead. In the writings of this and the immediately preceding period we see that the great Prophet, Prince, Conqueror, who is to appear, is not God, but one commissioned by God, and at most a God-inspired man or angel. So the apostles were only in unison with the best of their contemporaries when at present they hesitated to believe in, and were incapable of apprehending, the Divine nature of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/15-34.htm">Matthew 15:34</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How many loaves have ye?</span> Jesus gives no formal answer to the apostles' hesitating question, but by a new interrogation leads them to expect his interposition. This was the prelude to the miracle. <span class="cmt_word">Seven, and a few little fishes.</span> They de not add, as on the former occasion, "But what are they among so many?" They have learned something from what had previously occurred. Whether this little store was what remained of their own supplies, or whether it was all they could find among the multitude, does not appear. From the indeterminate mention of the fish, we should suppose the latter to have been the case, as they would probably have mentioned the number of the fishes had they been their own. There may have been some contempt implied in the diminutive <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "little fishes," as though these were scarcely worthy of notice.

This represents the blessing of the viands. Thanksgiving was a specially enjoined accompaniment of meals. The Talmud said, "He that enjoys anything without an act of thanksgiving is as one that robs the Almighty." The blessing here was the efficient cause of the multiplication of the food. Without any fresh creation Jesus used the materials ready to his hands, and only increased them by his Almighty power. <span class="cmt_word">Brake</span> them, and <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Looking to the tenses used, we should say that Jesus brake the viands once, and then kept continually giving of them to the twelve for the purpose of distribution. We do not read how the multitude was arranged in the present case. Possibly the locality did not admit of methodical division into ranks and companies, or, on the other hand, its natural terraces may have obviated the necessity for any such formal arrangement, the company falling naturally into convenient sections.

He wished to avoid all disturbance or collision with constituted authorities; and the people dispersed quietly, being less excitable than the inhabitants of Bethsaida, and not so well acquainted with the Messianic claims. The number thus dismissed was less than on the previous occasion, though the provision was greater - a difference which distinguishes one incident from the other, and which no forger would have introduced, it being much more natural to make the second wonder transcend, instead of falling short of, the previous one. We mention this here, because some critics have assumed that the present is only an imperfectly remembered account of the feeding of the five thousand already narrated. There are, of course, many points of similarity in the two incidents. Being of identical character, they must naturally present the same general features. But careful survey of the two narratives discloses many differences, which quite preclude the notion that the latter is a traditional reproduction of the former. To one who believes in the honesty and good faith of the evangelists, the allusion which Christ makes to the two miracles is a sufficient argument for their separation. Our Lord pointedly calls to mind the two occasions when he multiplied food, and rebukes the apostles for their lack of apprehension in the face of these marvels.

The two sects were directly opposed to each other, the traditional belief of the former being antagonistic to the scepticism and materialism of the latter. But both were hostile to Christ, whose teaching, on the one hand interfered with rabbinism, and on the other maintained the existence of the supernatural and the certainty of the resurrection. The Sadducees alone seem to have attacked Christ only on two occasions. They were probably Herodians (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>), and on this account also disliked by the Pharisees; but they were powerful, and held most of the highest offices in the state, and their alliance was sought or allowed in order more effectually to compromise Jesus. Even theological hatred and political opposition sank into indifference in the face of what was regarded as a common danger. Strauss and his school regard this combination as so unnatural that they throw discredit on the whole account. This is shallow criticism. Nothing is more common than for persons opposed on all other subjects to coalesce for an unholy purpose in which they are jointly interested. The most violent political opponents will join forces in order to gain some desired point, and. when an attack on the Church is meditated, even unbelievers are gladly welcomed. Tertullian says forcibly, "Christ is always being crucified between two thieves." <span class="cmt_word">Tempting</span>. Trying him with captious questions, to bring him into a difficulty, or to give them an opportunity of accusing him of heterodoxy, or disloyalty, or insubordination, and of discrediting him with the people. <span class="cmt_word">A sign from heaven.</span> The rabbis held that demons and. false gods could perform certain miracles on earth, but God alone could give signs from heaven, such as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the manna of Moses' time, the staying of the sun and moon by Joshua, the lightning and thunder that came at Samuel's word, the stroke of death on the captains who tried to arrest Elijah. They had heard of the miraculous meal just before, and saw how deeply the people were moved by it, and they would imply that such a miracle was no proof of a Divine mission, as it might have been wrought by magical or Satanic agency. Let Christ give a sign from heaven, and they would acknowledge his claims. They knew what Christ's answer would be, as they had already attacked him with the same demand (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>); and they hoped that he would either refuse to gratify them, as before, or else make an attempt and fail. In either case they thought they might turn the circumstance to his disadvantage. The Sadducees joined in the request, because they disbelieved in all such occurrences, and were fully persuaded that they were impossible, and any one who attempted to produce them must prove himself a miserable impostor. The word translated desired. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) is emphatic; the verb is used classically in the sense of "to put a question for decision;" so the interrogation here would signify that this was to be a final test of the claims of Christ; on his answer depended their adhesion or opposition (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, <i>It will be</i> fair weather: for the sky is red.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The paragraph consisting of this and ver. 3 is omitted by many good manuscripts, probably owing to its similarity to the passage in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>. These verses are most probably genuine; and they certainly could not have been foisted into the text from <a href="../../par/luke/12-54.htm">Luke 12:54-56</a>. The circumstances are too different, and the variations too marked, to make such interpolation probable. <span class="cmt_word">When it is evening.</span> The Pharisees had demanded a sign from heaven; Jesus points to the western glow in the sky, and taunts them with being ready enough to read the signs of the weather, but slow to interpret proofs of more important circumstances. He does not, in the case of these mixed cavillers, argue from Scripture, but from the natural world, and he points out that, had they eyes to see and a mind to discern, they might mark tokens in historical events, in the moral and spiritual world, which attested his Messiahship as clearly as any specially given sign  from heaven. Ye say, It will be <span class="cmt_word">fair weather</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). Probably an exclamation, <span class="accented">Ye say, Fair weather!</span> Rabbinical schools made a point of teaching weather lore; prognostications on this subject were greatly in vogue, and the rains of the coming year were annually foretold. On such meteorological observations, we may refer to Virgil, 'Georg,' 1:425, etc.; and Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 18:35 and 78. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And in the morning, <i>It will be</i> foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring.

Many examples are collected by Wetstein. <span class="cmt_word">Lowring</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); a word applied to the expression of the countenance ("his countenance fell," <a href="../../par/mark/10-22.htm">Mark 10:22</a>), and therefore applicable, by prosopopceia, to the look of the sky. Fillion quotes Aulus Gellius, 13:29, "Non solum in hominum corporibus, sed etiam in rerum cujusquemodi aliarum facies dicitur. Nam montis et coeli et maris facies, si tompestive dicatur, probe dicitur." <span class="cmt_word">O ye hypocrites</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). The word is omitted by some uncial manuscripts, the Vulgate, etc., and many modern editors. If it is genuine, we must consider that Christ thus calls them, because their pretence of being satisfied with sufficient proof of Christ's claims was a mere fiction, as they were obstinately determined never to acknowledge him. It would be casting pearls before swine to give further external proofs to people without sympathy and not open to conviction. <span class="cmt_word">The signs of the times</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Critical times, the age foretold for the appearance of the Messiah. These signs, which all who were candid and unbiassed might read, were such as the following: the sceptre had departed from Judah, and the lawgiver from between his feet; the fourth great empire was established; the prophetic weeks of Daniel were at their close; the Baptist had come in the spirit and power of Elias; all the world was expecting the advent of some great personage; the best and holiest Jews were looking for the Redeemer; Christ's own miracles and teaching proved his Divinity and the fulfilment of many obscure prophecies; these and such like signs were set for all to see and ponder, and the Lord, as he marked the obstinate unbelief of his countrymen, might well be grieved, and "sigh deeply in his spirit" (<a href="../../par/mark/8-12.htm">Mark 8:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.

These words our Lord had already uttered on a former occasion (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>), but he does not here explain them, as he did before (see Introduction, &sect; 7). Under similar circumstances he repeats himself, but he wastes not time in useless discussions with perverse opponents who will not see the truth. Of his death and resurrection, whereof Jonah was a type, they knew and understood nothing. Perhaps they thought of Jonah only as a prophet against the heathen city Nineveh, and a preacher of repentance, and were disposed to resent the allusion as an affront to their vaunted righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">He left them.</span> Took ship for Magedan, and crossed the lake to the northeast shore, in the neighbourhood of Bethsaida Julias. He, as it were, despaired of their improvement, and left them in righteous anger at their obduracy. "A man that is heretical after a first and second admonition refuse; knowing that such a one is perverted and sinneth, being self-condemned" (<a href="../../par/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10, 11</a>). Jesus never taught publicly or worked miracles again on this spot. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-5.htm">Matthew 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-12.</span> - <span class="accented">Warning against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-21</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They had forgotten</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not pluperfect); <span class="accented">came to the other side, and forgot</span>; <span class="accented">obliti sunt</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they perceived that they had forgotten to take sufficient bread for the journey before them. The district which they were about to traverse was but sparsely inhabited, and offered no hope of supplying this want. It is doubted whether the ensuing conversation took place during the voyage or after they had landed. The language of St. Mark inclines one to believe that the deficiency was discovered during the transit, and the remarks now narrated were made then. As it would take some hours to cross, there was ample time to feel and expatiate upon the need; and if Christ had told them of his future movements, they would naturally feel regret for their carelessness and want of forethought. Or it might be that Christ's observation concerning the leaven was made in the beat, and his reproof of their thoughts was given on landing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The leaven.</span> Christ's thoughts were still fixed on the late disputants, whose powerful influence on popular opinion called for forcible warning. By "leaven" he does not here refer specially to the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and Sadducees, as in <a href="../../par/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>, but to the evil influence which they exercised, which was diffused far and wide, and penetrated to all ranks and classes. Their unsound opinions, their inability or disinclination to enter into the spiritual sense of Scripture, vitiated their whole system, and made them dangerous teachers directly they attempted to explain or amplify the letter of Holy Writ. It was this same perverse blindness that led them to refuse to accept Jesus as Messiah in spite of all the proofs which had been brought  before them. That leaven, in one aspect, was regarded as a sign of impurity and corruption, we learn from the strict rules which banished it from Divine service, and especially during the Passover season. Says St. Paul, "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump" (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>); and, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Elsewhere Christ makes a distinction between what these teachers taught <span class="accented">ex cathedra</span>, and what they put forth on their own authority or what they practised themselves (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2, 3</a>, where see note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-7.htm">Matthew 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have taken no bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They reasoned among themselves.</span> With a crass literalness, the apostles utterly misunderstood the drift of their Master's warning, and thought that he alluded to their forgetfulness in coming without bread. They were always slow to apprehend the metaphorical and spiritual signification of their Master's language. Thus at the synagogue in Capernaum they failed to grasp his meaning when he spoke of himself as the Bread of life (<a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.), and at Jacob's well they interpreted of material food his Divine words concerning the nourishment of the soul (<a href="../../par/john/4.htm">John 4</a>.). It is well remarked by Sadler (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that "it is no small proof of the good faith and consequent truth of the gospel, that the apostles should have recorded things so against themselves as this account. If they had written for any purpose except the simple exhibition of the truth, they could easily have suppressed facts such as this, so very discreditable to their spiritual, indeed to their mental, perception. But if we had lost accounts such as these, we should have lost the proof of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, miracle of its kind; for no miraculous change in the spirit of man which God has wrought can be accounted greater than this - that men who, before the resurrection and the Day of Pentecost, should have exhibited such utter want of the lowest spiritual discernment, should, after the descent of the Spirit, have written such searching spiritual documents as the catholic Epistles of Peter and John." In the present case some commentators take it that the apostles fancied Christ was warning them against procuring any leavened bread from Pharisees and Sadducees, whom Jesus so sternly denounced; but it is more probable that their anxiety arose simply from the want of provisions, not from the consideration that they were debarred from obtaining them at the hands of certain parties. These doubts they seem to have whispered one to another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-8.htm">Matthew 16:8</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Which</i> when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus perceived</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). He knew their thoughts, if he did not overhear their words, and he reproved them severely on two accounts - first, for want of faith in his care; and secondly, for not understanding the mystical allusion in the word "leaven." <span class="cmt_word">Ye of little faith.</span> They showed lack of faith by being solicitous concerning bodily wants, thinking that Christ was regardless of, or unable to provide for them under all circumstances. He applied the same term to them elsewhere, as when they apprehended not the lesson of the grass of the field (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>), and when they were fearful in the storm on the lake (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - Christ, in support of his reproof, refers to the two miracles of the multiplication of food, which ought to have assured them of his care and power. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not yet understand?</span> So he asked in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-16.htm">Matthew 15:16</a>, "Are ye also yet without understanding?" Their heart was hardened, and they failed to apprehend the spiritual bearing of the incidents. <span class="cmt_word">Neither remember?</span> This was an additional ground for censure, that they even forgot the facts at the very time when they ought to have been recalled to their memory. Jesus reminds them of the distinctive differences between the two miracles, mentioning even the receptacles in which the fragments were collected - in the one case <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, small baskets, and in the other <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, large panniers. It is surely wilful perversity that has deemed these two incidents, thus pointedly disjoined by our Lord, as versions of one story; and yet this is what some modern critics have suggested and upheld. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-10.htm">Matthew 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</div><div class="comm">

But beware of the leaven</span>, etc. This is the second ground for the Lord's reproof administered to the apostles. They had taken in a carnal, literal sense a word which he had used in a symbolical or mystical meaning. It is the want of spiritual discernment which he censures. They had had frequent opportunities of hearing and appreciating his mode of teaching: miracles, parables, discourses, had an inner signification, which it was their duty to apprehend. The want of understanding was a moral fault for which they were answerable. We may say it would have been easier for our Lord to have spoken of doctrine without using the misunderstood figure of leaven. But it is in the way of his providence to speak words which need thought and grace to make them fully comprehended. They are thus more impressed upon the heart and memory, and bring forth better fruit. A well instructed Hebrew ought to have no difficulty in understanding metaphorical allusions. His Scriptures were full of them, and could not be  intelligently read without the light thus cast upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-12.htm">Matthew 16:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then understood they how that he bade <i>them</i> not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then understood they.</span> Jesus did not explain his meaning further; but his reproof roused their intellect, made them reflect, set them on the road to the truth. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">doctrine.</span> This was what Jesus meant by "the leaven." In a wider sense it might include practice as well as precept, manner of life as well as teaching. The same spirit permeated all. "See," says St. Chrysostom, "how much good his reproof wrought. For it both led them away from the Jewish observances, and, when they were remiss. made them more heedful, and delivered them from want of faith; so that they were not afraid nor in alarm, if at any time they seemed to have few loaves; nor were they careful about famine, but despised all these things."

Our Lord had landed at Bethsaida, where the Jordan enters the Lake of Gennesaret, turned northwards, and, following the course of the river, had now arrived in the vicinity of one of its chief sources at Caesarea Philippi, the most northerly city of the Holy Land. It was, if not identical with, in close proximity to, the Dan of the Old Testament, whence arose the saying, "From Dan to Beersheba," to denote the whole extent of country from north to south. Later it was called <span class="accented">Paneas</span>, and now <span class="accented">Banias.</span> Philip altered the name to Caesarea in honour of Tiberius Caesar, his patron. Christ seems not to have visited the city itself, but only the outlying villages in the district. We may conjecture why at this Lime he moved to this remote region. It was probably, partly, a measure of precaution. He had excited the fiercest animosity of the dominant party, and even of the sceptical Sadducees; he was pertinaciously followed by their emissaries, always on the watch to lay hold of his words and actions, and to found upon them dangerous charges; and now, knowing it was time to announce to his followers in plain terms his claim to be Messiah, he would not do this in Judaea, where it might cause commotion, and embroil him with the authorities, but preferred to teach this great truth where he might speak freely without fear of immediate consequences, out of the reach of his persevering opponents. Virtually, also, his public work in Judaea and Galilee had reached its end. He had no chance of a hearing if he had made further attempts at teaching. The calumnies of the rabbis had affected the fickle populace, who would willingly have followed a military pretender, but had no heart to set at nought their national teachers in favour of One whom they were persuaded to regard as a dangerous innovator, not improbably upheld by Satanic agency. <span class="cmt_word">He asked his disciples.</span> It was after a time of solitary prayer (<a href="../../par/luke/9-18.htm">Luke 9:18</a>) that he put this question to his followers.

The four popular opinions here mentioned showed two facts - that Jesus had a high reputation among his contemporaries, and that he was by none at this time regarded as the Messiah. Even those who, after certain of his marvellous works, had been ready to honour him with that title, soon cooled in their ardour, and, checked by his reserve and the slanders of the Pharisees, learned to see in him only a wonder-worker or a precursor of the expected Prince and Liberator.

Some of the others probably would have been less ready to make the same confession; but in his vehement loyalty, Peter silences all hesitation, and declares boldly what must be the conviction of all his comrades. He speaks out the persuasion wrought in his soul by Divine grace. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art the Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="accented">The Christ</span>; the Anointed, the Messiah. <span class="accented">The Son of God</span>; of the same substance, one with the Father. <span class="accented">Living</span>; as alone "having life in himself," "the living and true God" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). The same (or nearly the same) confession was made by Peter in the name of all the apostles at Capernaum (<a href="../../par/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>); but the sense of the expression was different, and sprang from very different conviction. It referred rather to the subjective view of Christ's character, as it influenced the believer's inward assurance of the source of eternal life. Here the acknowledgment concerns the nature, office, and Person of our Lord. That there was some special distinction between the two enunciations is evident from Christ's unique commendation of Peter on this occasion compared with his silence on the former. The present confession is indeed a noble one, containing itself a compendium of the Catholic faith concerning the Person and work of Christ. Herein Peter acknowledges Jesus to be the true Messiah, commissioned and sent by God to reveal his will to man, and accomplishing all that the prophets had foretold concerning him; no mere man, not even the most exalted of men (which common opinion held Messiah to be) but the Son of God, of the substance of the Father, begotten from everlasting, God of God, perfect God and perfect man, Son of God and Son of man. Such was Peter's faith. The Church has added nothing to it, though she has amplified and explained and illustrated it in her Creeds; for it comprises belief in Christ's Messiahship, Divinity, Incarnation, personality, and the momentous issues depending thereon. We need not suppose that Peter understood all this or speculated on the question how these several attributes were united in Christ. He was content to accept and acknowledge the truth, waiting patiently for further light. This is the attitude which Christ approves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed <i>it</i> unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said unto him.</span> This weighty and momentous answer is given alone by St. Matthew. St. Mark, who wrote under the instruction of Peter, and for Roman Christians, mentions it not; the other two evangelists are equally silent, having evidently not understood the special importance attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed art</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou, Simon Bar-jona.</span> "Blessed," as in the sermon on the mount (ch. 5.), expressing a solemn benediction, not a mere encomium. Peter was highly favoured by a special revelation from God. Christ calls him "son of Jona," to intimate that Peter's confession is true - that he himself is as naturally and truly Son of God as Peter is son of Jona. So Christ addresses him when he restores the fallen apostle at the Sea of Galilee after the second miraculous draught of fishes, reminding him of his frail human nature in the face of great spiritual privileges (<a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>, etc.; comp. Matthew 1:42).

This introduces the reason why Christ calls him "Blessed." <span class="cmt_word">Flesh and blood.</span> This is a phrase to express the idea of the natural man, with his natural endowments and faculties. So St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "I conferred not with flesh and blood;" and "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The Son of Sirach speaks of "the generation of flesh and blood" (Ecclus. 14:18). No natural sagacity, study, or discernment had revealed the great truth. None of these had overcome slowness of apprehension, prejudices of education, slackness of faith. No unregenerate mortal man had taught him the  gospel mystery. <span class="cmt_word">My Father which is in heaven.</span> Christ thus accepts Peter's definition of him as "the Son of the living God."

But probably no such distinction is intended here, as there would be none in Aramaic. There is plainly a paronomasia here in the Greek; and, if our Lord spoke in Aramaic, the same play of words was exhibited in <span class="accented">Kephas</span> or <span class="accented">kepha.</span> When Jesus first called Peter to be a disciple, he imposed upon him the name <span class="accented">Cephas</span>, which the evangelist explains to be <span class="accented">Peter</span> (<a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>). The name was bestowed in anticipation of Peter's great confession: "Thou shalt be called." This preannouncement was here fulfilled and confirmed. Upon this passage chiefly the claims of the Roman Church, which for fifteen centuries have been the subject of acrimonious controversy, are founded. It is hence assumed that the Christian Church is founded upon Peter and his successors, and that these successors are the Bishops of Rome. The latter assertion may be left to the decision of history, which fails to <span class="accented">prove</span> that Peter was ever at Rome, or that he transmitted his supposed supremacy to the episcopate of that city. We have in this place to deal with the former assertion. Who or what is the <span class="accented">rock</span> on which Christ says that he will hereafter build his Church? French Romanists consider it a providential coincidence that they can translate the passage, "Je te disque, Tu es Pierre; et sur cette pierre je batirai," etc.; but persons outside the papal communion are not satisfied to hang their faith on a play of words. The early Fathers are by no means at one in their explanations of the paragraph. Living before Rome had laid claim to the tremendous privileges which it afterwards affected, they did not regard the statement in the light of later controversies; and even those who held Peter to be the rock would have indignantly repelled the assumptions which have been built on that interpretation. The apostolic Fathers seem to have mentioned the passage in none of their writings; and they could scarcely have failed to refer to it had they been aware of the tremendous issues dependent thereon. It was embodied in no Catholic Creed, and never made an article of the Christian faith. We may remark also that of the evangelists St. Matthew alone records the promise to Peter; Mark and Luke give his confession, which was the one point which Christ desired to elicit, and omit that which is considered to concern his privileges. This looks as though, in their view, the chief aim of the passage was not Peter, but Christ; not Peter's pre-eminence, but Christ's nature and office. At the same time, to deny all allusion to Peter in the "rock" is quite contrary to the genius of the language and to New Testament usage, and would not have been so pressed in modern times except for polemical purposes. Three views have been held on the interpretation of this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That Christ himself is the Rock on which the Church should be built. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That Peter's confession of Jesus Christ as Son of God, or God incarnate, is the Rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That St. Peter is the rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The first explanation is supported by passages where in Christ speaks of himself in the third person, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Destroy this temple;" "If any man eat of this bread; Whoso falleth on this stone," etc. In the same sense are cited the words of Isaiah (Isaiah 28:16), "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation." Almighty God is continually called "a Rock" in the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-32.htm">2 Samuel 22:32</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2, 6, 7</a>, etc.), so that it might be deemed natural and intelligible for Christ to call himself "this Rock," in accordance, with the words of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>), "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which is Jesus Christ." But then the reference to Peter becomes unmeaning: "Thou art Peter, and upon myself I will build my Church." It is true that some few eminent authorities have taken this view. Thus St. Augustine writes, "It was not said to him, 'Thou art a rock (<span class="accented">petra</span>),' but, 'Thou art Peter,' and the Rock was Christ" ('Retract.,' 1:21). And commentators have imagined that Christ pointed to himself as he spoke. In such surmises there is an inherent improbability, and they do not explain the commencement of the address. In saying, "Thou art Peter," Christ, if he made any gesture at all, would have touched or turned to that apostle. Immediately after this to have directed attention to himself would have been most unnatural and contradictory. We may safely surrender the interpretation which regards Christ himself as the Rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The explanation which finds the rock in Peter's great confession has been widely adopted by commentators ancient and modern. Thus St. Chrysostom, "Upon this rock, that is, on the faith of his confession. Hereby he signifies that many were now on the point of believing, and raises his spirit, and  makes him a shepherd." To the same purport might be quoted Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory Nyss., Cyril, and others. It is remarkable that in the Collect from the Gregorian Sacramentary and in the Roman Missal on the Vigil of St. Peter and St. Paul are found the words, "Grant that thou wouldst not suffer us, whom thou hast established on the rock of the apostolic confession (<span class="accented">quos in apostolicae confessionis petra solidasti</span>) to be shaken by any commotions." Bishop Wordsworth, as many exegetes virtually do, combines the two interpretations, and we cite his exposition as a specimen of the view thus held: "What he says is this, 'I myself, now confessed by thee to be both God and Man, am the Rock of the Church. This is the foundation on which it is built.' And because St. Peter had confessed him as such, he says to St. Peter, 'Thou hast confessed me, and I will now confess thee; thou hast owned me, I will now own thee. Thou art Peter,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou art a lively <span class="accented">stone</span>, hewn out of and built upon me, the living <span class="accented">Rock.</span> Thou art a genuine <span class="accented">Petros</span> of me, the Divine <span class="accented">Petra.</span> And whosoever would be a lively stone, a <span class="accented">Peter</span>, must imitate thee in this thy true confession of me, the living <span class="accented">Rock</span>; for upon this Rock, that is, on myself, believed and confessed to be both God and Man, I will build my Church." As the opinion that Christ means himself by "this rock" is untenable, so we consider that Peter's confession is equally debarred from being the foundation intended. Who does not see that the Church is to be built, not on confessions or dogmas, but on men - men inspired by God to teach the great truth? A confession implies a confessor; it was the person who made the confession that is meant, not the mere statement itself, however momentous and true. Thus elsewhere the Church is said to have been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), "Ye," says St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), "as living stones are built up a spiritual house." "James and Cephas who were reputed to be pillars" (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). In Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>) the foundationstones of the heavenly temple are "the twelve apostles of the Lamb." Hence we gather that the rock is a person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> So we come to the explanation of the difficulty which naturally is deduced from the language if considered without regard to prejudice or the pernicious use to which it has been put. Looking at the matter in a straightforward way, we come to the conclusion that Christ is wishing to reward Peter for his outspoken profession of faith; and his commendation is couched in a form which was usual in Oriental addresses, and intelligible to his hearers. "Thou hast said to me, 'Thou art the Son of God;' I say to thee, 'Thou art Peter,' a rock man, 'and on thee,' as a rock, 'I will build my Church.' "As he was the first to acknowledge Christ's nature and office, so he was rewarded by being appointed as the apostle who should inaugurate the Christian Church and lay its first foundation. His name and his work were to coincide. This promise was fulfilled in Peter's acts. He it was who took the lead on the Day of Pentecost, when at his preaching, to the hundred and twenty disciples there were added three thousand souls (<a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>); he it was who admitted the Gentiles to the Christian community (<a href="../../par/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.); he it was who in these early days stood forth prominently as a master builder, and was the first to open the kingdom of heaven to Jews and Gentiles. It is objected that, if Peter was a builder, he could not be the rock on which the building was raised. The expression, of course, is metaphorical. Christ builds the Church by employing Peter as the foundation of the spiritual house; Peter's zeal and activity and stable faith are indeed the living rock which forms the material element, so to speak, of this erection; he, as labouring in the holy cause beyond all others, at any rate in the early days of the gospel, is regarded as that solid basis on which the Church was raised. Christ, in one sense, builds on Peter; Peter builds on Christ. The Church, in so far as it was visible, had Peter for its rocky foundation; in so far as it was spiritual, it was founded on Christ. The distinction thus accorded in the future to Peter was personal, and carried with it none of the consequences which human ambition or mistaken pursuit of unity have elicited therefrom. There was no promise of present supremacy; there was no promise of the privilege being handed down to successors. The other apostles had no conception of any superiority being now conferred on Peter. It was not long after this that there was a strife among them who should be the greatest; James and John claimed the highest places in the heavenly kingdom; Paul resisted Peter to the face "because he stood condemned" (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>); the president of the first council was James, the Bishop of Jerusalem. It is plain that neither Peter himself nor his fellow apostles understood or acknowledged his supremacy; and that he transmitted, or was intended to transmit, such authority to successors, is a figment unknown to primitive Christianity, and which was gradually erected, to serve ambitious designs, on forged decretals and spurious writings. This is not the place for polemics, and these few apologetic hints are introduced merely with the view of showing that no one need be afraid of the  obvious and straightforward interpretation of Christ's words, or suppose that papal claims are necessarily supported thereby. <span class="cmt_word">I will build my Church</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). My Church, not thine. Plainly, therefore, the Church was not yet builded. Christ speaks of it as a house, temple, or palace, perhaps at the moment gazing on some castle founded securely on a rock, safe from flood and storm and hostile attack. We know how commonly he took his illustrations from objects and scenes around him; and the rocky base of the great castle of Caesarea Philippi may well have supplied the material for the metaphor here introduced. The word translated "church" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is found here for the first time in the New Testament. It is derived from a verb meaning "to call out," and in classical Greek denotes the regular legislative assembly of a people. In the Septuagint it represents the Hebrew <span class="accented">kahal</span>, the congregation united into one society and forming one polity (see Trench, 'Synonyms'). The name <span class="accented">kehila</span> in modern times is applied to every Jewish community which has its own synagogue and ministers. From the use of the metaphor of a house, and the word employed to designate the Church, we see that it was not to be a mere loose collection of items, but an organized whole, united, officered, and permanent. Hence the word <span class="accented">Ecclesia</span> has been that which designated the Christian society, and has been handed down and recognized in all ages and in all countries. It may be regarded as the personal part of that kingdom of heaven which was to embrace the whole world, when "the kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ" (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; see Introduction, &sect; 10.). <span class="cmt_word">The gates of hell</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall not prevail against it.</span> Hades, which our version calls "hell," is the region of the dead, a gloomy and desolate place, according to Jewish tradition, situated in the centre of the earth, a citadel with walls and gates, which admitted the souls of men, but opened not for their egress. There are two ways of explaining these words, though they both come to much the same idea. The gates of Hades represent the entrance thereto; and the Lord affirms that death shall have no power over the members of the Church; they shall be able to rise superior to its attacks, even if for a time they seem to succumb; their triumphant cry shall he, "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). Through the grave and gate of death they shall pass to a joyful resurrection. The other interpretation is derived from the fact that in Oriental cities the gate is the scene of deliberation and counsel. Hence "the gates" here may represent the evil designs planned by the powers of hell to overthrow the Church, the wiles and machinations of the devil and his angels, Hades being taken, not as the abode of the dead, but as the realm of Satan. Neither malignant spirits nor their allies, such as sin, persecution, heresy, shall be able to wreck the eternal building which Christ was founding. Combining the two expositions, we may say that Christ herein promises that neither the power of death nor the power of the devil <span class="accented">shall prevail against it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), shall overpower it, keep it in subjection. The pronoun refers doubtless to <span class="accented">Church</span>, not <span class="accented">rock</span>, the verb being more applicable to the former than the latter, and the pronoun being nearer in position to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. To see here an assurance of the infallibility of the pope, as Romanists do, is to force the words of Scripture most unwarrantably in order to support a modern figment which has done infinite harm to the cause of Christ. As Erasmus says, "Proinde miror esse, qui locum hunc detorqueant ad Romanum Pontificem." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a></div><div class="verse">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</span> The metaphor of a house or castle, with its gates that must be opened with keys, is still maintained; or else the idea is of the exercise of a stewardship in a household. But the latter seems unnecessarily to introduce a new notion, and to mar the concinnity of the passage. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a> we read, "The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open" - where the figure is similar. The delivery of the keys of a city, etc., to a person, symbolizes the handing over of the authority to that person. "The kingdom of heaven" means here the visible Church of Christ in its most extended form. In this Church, hereafter to be constituted, Peter personally is promised a certain authority. This is a personal reward for his good confession, and a prediction of the way in which he was to exercise it. At the same time, there is a change in the figure used. He who was the foundation of the Church is now its overseer, and may open or shut its doors, may admit or exclude whomsoever he will, always following the guidance of the inspiring Spirit. This promise was fulfilled after the Day of Pentecost. It seems to have been at this time only promised, not conferred upon Peter. The actual gift of the power to him and his brother apostles took place after the Resurrection, as we read in <a href="../../par/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>. The "power of the keys," as it is called, is considered to have two branches - a legislative power and an absolving power. The former Peter exercised when he took the  lead after the effusion of the Spirit, and opened the door to the Jews. It was his action that admitted the Gentiles, without compliance with the distinctive rites of Judaism, to all the privileges of the gospel (see <a href="../../par/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>). This most momentous precedent he established and made good for all time. These were legislative acts which he had the honour of introducing, and which, thus inaugurated, upheld, and defended by him, tended to advance that unity which the Lord held so dear. As an instance of his shutting the door of the kingdom in the face of an impious intruder, we may notice his rebuke to Simon Magus (<a href="../../par/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21</a>), "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter." The absolving power, supposed to be contained in the gift of the keys, seems rather to belong to the terms of the succeeding promise. We conceive that this power was first given to St. Peter in acknowledgment of his good confession, and as an emblem of unity, and was afterwards bestowed on all the apostles. That the Fathers did not regard it as limited exclusively to Peter, may he seen by quotations gathered by Wordsworth and other commentators. Thus Tertullian, 'Scorpiac.,' 10, "Memento claves hic Dominum Petro, et per illum Ecclesiae reliquisse;" St. Cyprian, 'De Unit.,' p. 107, "Apostolis omnibus post resurrectionem suam parem potestatem tribuit;" St. Augustine, 'Serm.,' 295, "Has claves non homo unus, sed unitas accepit Ecclcsiae." <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,</span> etc. "Binding" and "loosing" has been explained in various ways. Some say the terms mean admitting or debarring from the Church, which would make them identical with the power of the keys, and would give no additional privilege; whereas it is plain that further honour is intended to be bestowed. Others affirm that the expression is to be understood of absolution from sin. They take the metaphor to be derived from a prisoner and his chain. Sinners are tied and bound with the chain of their sins; they are released on repentance by the ministry of reconciliation (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18, 19</a>); they are bound, when the means of grace are withheld from them, owing to the absence of tokens of' sincerity and faith. This is the view taken in the Anglican Ordinal, where to the priest it is solemnly said, "Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained." But this was no special gift to Peter; it was bestowed not long after upon all the apostolic body in the very same terms (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>), and was indeed inherent in the ministry. This interpretation also introduces a new element into the promise, which does not agree with the context. There is nothing to lead one to expect such an item, and to supply "sins" to the general term "whatsoever" twice repeated, is harsh and unnatural. A more reasonable explanation of the phrase is derived from the use of the terms among the Jews themselves. In their Talmudic glosses we find equivalent expressions. "To bind" is to forbid, to pronounce unlawful; "to loose" is to allow, to declare lawful. And the Lord here promises Peter a certain pre-eminence in the government and organization of the Church, and that the rules which he ordained and the sentences which he should pass in the due exercise of his apostolical authority, should be ratified and confirmed in heaven (Burgon). The phrase is found in Josephus, expressive of the possession, of unrestricted authority. Thus he speaks of the Pharisees as having power to loose and bind (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) whom they would ('Bell. Jud.,' 1:05. 2). And it is noted that an inscription upon a statue of Isis reads, "I am the queen of the country, and whatsoever I bind no man can loose" (Diod. Sic., 1:27). This is a personal distinction conferred on St. Peter in the exercise of an office common to all the apostles, it was needful, in the early Church, that one should be chosen, <span class="accented">primus inter pares</span>, to be the chief office bearer and leader of the body of believers. Not that he conceived himself to be, or was recognized by others as, infallible, or as an irresponsible despot; many events before and after Pentecost forbid such an assumption; but his faith, character, and zeal pointed him out as well constituted to regulate and order the infant community, and to take the first part in maintaining that unity which was essential to the new kingdom. This personal primacy may justly be conceded, even by those who are most inimical to the arrogant claims of the papacy; for it carries not with it the consequences which have been appended. Precedence in rank does not of necessity involve supreme or even superior authority. A duke has no authority over a baron, though he has precedence. The fuller consideration of this sphere of the subject belongs rather to the historian and the polemist than to the expositor, and to such we leave it, only adding that, in his peculiar privilege, Peter stands alone, and that in his extraordinary power he had, and was intended to have, no successors.

The injunction to tell no man (with which comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>) was necessary at this time for many reasons. The time was not ripe for the declaration which might have led to tumult and disorder among an excited populace. Any ambitious ideas which the apostles might have formed from what had just passed were here nipped in the bud. They were not sufficiently familiar with the true notion of the Messiah, especially a suffering Messiah, to be competent to preach him to others. This we see by Peter's inconsiderate remonstrance in ver. 22. Till they received the Holy Ghost after Christ's ascension, they could not rightly and profitably preach of Christ's nature, office, and kingdom. Jesus may have looked forward to their desertion of him in his hour of trial, and prevented them from proclaiming his real character, which, in the face of such desertion, would have proved a stumbling block to the faith of believers. Some of these reasons we may reverently believe were those which led Christ to lay this severe restriction on the enthusiasm of his followers (see on Matthew 17:9).

He had already intimated his future sufferings, though his disciples had been slow to receive these dark hints, so opposed to all their preconceived opinions of Messiah's glory and victorious career. Such sayings as, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up" (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), had fallen unheeded on the disciples' ears, and had not guided them to forecast the future. Even the allusions to their own trials, in the warnings about bearing the cross and following him (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>), were not understood. The great point of his real nature had become clear to them; they had now to learn that the way to glory, both for him and them, led through suffering and death. Conscious of Christ's Divinity, they could now more patiently endure the mystery of his cross and Passion. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Jerusalem.</span> The appointed scene of these events (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">go</span> thither to meet and endure these sufferings, because it was so ordained in the counsels of God and announced by the prophets (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-54.htm">Matthew 26:54</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26, 46</a>).

The whole religious world would thus be combined against Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Be killed.</span> He does not here say "crucified," as he did afterwards (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>), only gradually revealing the whole awful truth. <span class="cmt_word">Be raised again the third day.</span> This announcement was intended to support the disciples in view of Christ's sufferings and death. And "the third day" is mentioned, not only for typical reasons, but to assure them that his death should be speedily followed by his return to life from the grave. It is obvious to us that Jesus prophesied plainly concerning his resurrection; but such an event, so unprecedented, so unexperienced, was not understood; and though the prediction was so far known as to cause his grave to be watched, it was only a vague kind of expectation, without form or definiteness, that was cherished, and the actual fact came as a surprise (see <a href="../../par/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10, 32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a></div><div class="verse">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter took him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Either taking him aside, or taking him by the hand or dress - a reverent familiarity permitted by the Lord to his loving apostle. And now this same Peter, who had just before made his noble confession, and had been rewarded with unique commendation, unable to shake off the prejudices of his age and his education, <span class="cmt_word">began to rebuke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) his Master. He presumed to chide Jesus for speaking of suffering and death. He, the Son of God most High, what had he to do with such things? How could he name them in connection with himself? Peter, while accepting the idea of Messiah as Divine and triumphant, could not receive the notion of his death and Passion. That the same person should be so humiliated and yet so glorious, was beyond his conception. He was as much in  the dark as his fellow apostles; of that which was not specially revealed to him he knew nothing. It was the carnal mind that here influenced him, not the spiritually enlightened soul. By writing "began," the historian intimates that he had not time to say much before the Lord mercifully interposed and cut him short. <span class="cmt_word">Be it far from thee;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">absit a te.</span> The Greek phrase is elliptical, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> being understood; "God be merciful to thee," equivalent to "God forbid."

This is a very strong assertion, not a prayer or wish, as some would make it; the use of language is quite against that, as the phrase is predictive, never prohibitory, in his mistaken zeal and his ignorant affection, Peter would be wiser than his Lord. The cross and Passion shall never be thy lot; Messiah cannot suffer, the Son of God cannot die. Such merely human asseveration, even prompted by undoubted love, had to be checked and rebuked.

Touching him therefore sharply, he saith, 'My Passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding, thou wouldst know that this of all things most becometh me.

"When? when St. Peter said, 'Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee,' and was told, 'Get thee behind me, Satan.' For Christ was by no means satisfied with the mere rebuke of Peter, but, willing more abundantly to show both the extravagance of Peter's words and the future benefit of his Passion, he saith, 'Thy word to me is, "Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee;" but my word to thee is, "Not only is it hurtful to thee to impede me and to be displeased at my Passion, but it will be impossible for thee even to be saved, unless thou thyself too be continually prepared for death."' Thus, lest they should think his suffering unworthy of him, not by the former words only, but by those that were coming, he teaches them the gain thereof." <span class="cmt_word">If any man will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">wills to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>come after me.</span> To come after Christ is to be his follower and disciple, and the Lord here declares what will be the life of such a one (see a parallel passage, <a href="../../par/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38, 39</a>). Jesus mentions three points which belong to the character of a true disciple. The first is self-denial. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">him deny himself.</span> There is no better test of reality and earnestness in the religious life than this. (See a sermon of Newman's on this subject, vol. 1. serm. 5.) If a man follows Jesus, it must be by his own free will, and he must voluntarily renounce everything that might hinder his discipleship, denying himself even in things lawful that he may approach the likeness of his Master. <span class="cmt_word">Take up his cross.</span> This is the second point. St. Luke adds, "daily." He must not only be resigned to bear what is brought upon him - suffering, shame, and death, which he cannot escape, but be eager to endure it, meet it with a solemn joy, be glad that he is counted worthy of it. <span class="cmt_word">Follow me.</span> The third point. He must be energetic and active, not passive only and resigned, but with all zeal tracking his Master's footsteps, which lead on the way of sorrows. Here too is comfort; he is not called to a task as yet untried; Christ has gone before, and in his strength he may be strong.

Here are set forth the highest motives for courage, endurance, and perseverance in the way of righteousness. The word translated "life" is used four times in this and the following verse, though in the latter it is rendered "soul" in the Anglican Version. The fact is the word is used in two senses: for the life which now is - the bodily life: and the life which is to come - the spiritual, the everlasting life. These are indeed two stages of the same life - that which is bounded by earth and that which is to be passed with the glorified body in heaven; but they are for the moment regarded as distinct, though intimately connected by belonging to the same personality. And the Lord intimates that any one who avoids bodily death and suffering by compromise of duty, by denying Christ and disowning the truth, shall lose everlasting life. On the other hand, whosoever sacrifices his life for the sake of Christ, to promote his cause, shall save his soul and be eternally rewarded. <span class="cmt_word">Shall find it.</span> "Find," as the opposite of "lose," is here equivalent to "save." There may, too, be in it a notion of something great and unexpected, a treasure discovered, "salvation far beyond all that they looked for" (Wisd. 5:2). Says St. Gregory, "If you keep your seed, you lose it; if you sow it, you will find it again" ('Hom. in Evang.,' 32.).

Many, taking it in connection with the preceding announcement, refer it exclusively to the day of judgment; but this idea is not compatible with Christ's assertion that some present shall see it ere they die. Nor can it refer to Christ's resurrection and ascension, and the mission of the Holy Ghost, which took place only half a year after this time, and the prediction of which so short a time before could not have been introduced in the terms here used. Other expositors, and some of great name, agree that the event to which Christ alludes is his transfiguration narrated in the next chapter. But there are insuperable objections to this view.  How could Christ assert in the most solemn manner, <span class="cmt_word">Verily, I say unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span>, that some of his hearers would tire to witness an event which was to occur only a week hence? Nor is it likely that he would thus publicly announce a transaction which was strictly private, seen only by three chosen witnesses, who were further charged not to reveal the vision till the Son of man was risen from the dead. The Lord had been telling of the final judgment; he now announces, with the formula used by him to present some revelation of Divine truth, that there was to be a coming of the Son of man at no very distant date. This advent is doubtless the destruction of Jerusalem, which, as it occurred only some forty years after this time, some of his auditors, apostles and the multitude, would live to behold. This great event was a type of the second advent, the two being closely connected by Christ himself (see ch. 24.). There is some truth in all the views that have obtained concerning this passage: "The prophecy unfolded itself by degrees; it has put forth buds and blossoms, but it will not be in its full bloom of accomplishment till the great day" (Wordsworth). There was some display of Christ's kingdom at the Transfiguration; another at his resurrection, and the events consequent thereupon; but the great one was when the overthrow of Jerusalem and its temple made way for the full establishment and development of the gospel, putting an end to the first dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Some standing</span> (<span class="accented">of them that stand</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>here</span>. Among the apostles St. John certainly survived the destruction of Jerusalem. There seems to be no recondite meaning in the term "standing," as if it signified "remaining steadfastly by me, adhering to my side;" as, <span class="cmt_word">taste of death</span> is merely a periphrasis for "die," and has not the sense of tasting the bitterness of death, experiencing its sting. It appears to have been originally a metaphor derived from a nauseous draught, which every one must drain. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in his kingdom.</span> Not "into his kingdom," but in the power and glory that appertain to his kingdom. Not that he will personally appear, but his mystical presence will be seen by its effects, the judgment on the Jewish nation, the establishment of a spiritual, yet visible kingdom in the place of the old covenant. There may be a similar allusion in Christ's words about St. John, "If I will that he tarry till I come" (<a href="../../par/john/21-23.htm">John 21:23</a>), and "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>) - where the dissolution of the Jewish polity is the event signified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/17.htm"><title>Matthew 17 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/17.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/17.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/17-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/16.htm" title="Matthew 16">&#9668;</a> Matthew 17 <a href="../matthew/18.htm" title="Matthew 18">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a></div><div class="verse">And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The Transfiguration of Jesus</span>. (<a href="../../par/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28-36</a>.) This mysterious event was intended primarily to confirm the faith of the three apostles who were to have the chief hand in founding the Church. The Lord had  just announced his future sufferings and death. This prediction had been a grievous blow to Peter, and doubtless to the others also. He had stumbled at the cross, and had brought on himself a stern rebuke for his slowness and worldliness. So to comfort the chosen three under the thought of what awaited their Master, they were shown a glimpse of the glory which he has in heaven; they saw the Law and the prophets yielding subjection to him; they heard the voice of the Father announcing his Sonship. Henceforward they might take courage under all circumstances; the cross would be no infamy or disgrace - would open the way to victory and glory. Here was a foretaste of the blessedness of heaven - to be with Christ and his saints in his kingdom. Such was the Transfiguration to the three witnesses. To the world, when in due time it was made known, it taught lessons of the Incarnation, the resurrection of the body, the glory that shall be the portion of the righteous. For Christ himself it was the culminating point of his earthly life, "the solemn installation of our Lord to his sufferings and their result" (Alford). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After six days.</span> St. Luke says, "about an eight days after these sayings," either speaking indefinitely, or using the inclusive method of reckoning which we find in the recounts of our Lord's resurrection. The days are counted from the time of Peter's confession and Christ's subsequent announcement. The little company were still in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, though we know not exactly in what place, and nothing is told of the events of this week. The memorable day may be specially noticed as being the same day of the week as that on which the great confession was made in the previous se'nnight; or, if we regard the typical bearing of numbers in Scripture, the six days signify the world and daily labour, the seventh, "after six days," typifies heaven and rest. <span class="cmt_word">Peter, James, and John.</span> These three, the chosen of the chosen, had already witnessed Christ's power over death in the chamber of Jairus's daughter; later they were present at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. They who had seen his glory were strengthened to behold his sweat of blood. These men formed the inner circle of his friends; to them he gave the privilege of knowing more of his inner life and nature. They were selected for various reasons - Peter, for his energy, zeal, and love, and the part he was to play in the founding of the Church; John, because he was beloved by Christ, and was to be the recipient of Divine revelation; James, because he was to be the head of the Church of Jerusalem, and soon to drink of Christ's cup and war a good warfare. The James here named is the son of Zebedee, and brother of John, and was put to death by Herod Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">An high mountain.</span> The only tradition concerning the locality of the Transfiguration (which none of the inspired narratives further identifies) affixes it to Mount Tabor, the beautiful isolated mountain, which rises some eighteen hundred feet on the northeast of the Plain of Esdraelon. This tradition, as far as we know, was first published in the fourth century A.D, by St. Cyril of Jerusalem ('Catech.,' 12:16) and St. Jerome (Ep. 44. 'Ad Marcell.;' Ep. 108. 'Ad Eustoch.'), and thence was generally adopted and upheld till the sixteenth century, both by commentators and travellers. Since then more accurate examination and historical criticism have thrown grave doubts on this identification. The summit of Tabor has from a very early age been occupied by habitations. It is spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a> as including in its limits a city and its suburbs. Later it was strongly fortified, and the whole area was surrounded with a wall, of which the ruins can still be traced. In our Lord's time the town and the fortress covered the level portion of the hill, and there would have been no place of retirement where he could have withdrawn <span class="accented">apart</span> for the purpose of the vision. There is another reason that makes Tabor unlikely to have been the scene of the Transfiguration. The last geographical notice left our Lord and his disciples outside Galilee in the neighbourhood of Paneas. It was about a three days' journey thence to Esdraelon; but no mention is made of any such movement during this week, and it is after the Transfiguration that the synoptists intimate that the return to Galilee took place (see ver. 22; <a href="../../par/mark/9-30.htm">Mark 9:30</a>). We must therefore surrender the old tradition, and look in the vicinity of Caesarea for the <span class="accented">high mountain</span> of our narrative. There was no lack of such in that region, and it was doubtless on one of the offshoots of Hermon that the glorious vision was vouchsafed, though more precise identification is impossible. Hermon itself is called by the Arabs <span class="accented">Jebel-esh-Sheikh</span>, "The Chief Mountain," and the way in which the locality is introduced in the narrative, without further specification, seems to point to some eminence of the most obvious and best known hill of the district. St. Peter, when in after years  he alluded to it, called it merely "the holy mount" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>); and we may conclude that we are not intended to know more about it, lest we should be tempted to make more of the material circumstances than of the great reality. St. Luke notifies that the Lord retired to this place in order to pray. It may have been that he prayed for the enlightemnent of the apostles - that they might receive the teaching of the Transfiguration and the subsequent sayings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was transfigured</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">transfiguratus est</span>. The verb is used in classical Greek of transformation, as of a man into an animal. Here it refers to a change of countenance, which is the chief index of any change exterior or interior. St. Luke explains the matter with the words, "The fashion of his countenance was altered." The Word of God allows for a brief space his essential glory to irradiate and shine through the form of a servant which he wore. Not that he showed his Divine nature, or laid aside his human body; his bodily nature remained in its entirety, but permeating it was an effulgence which indicated the Godhead. Perhaps it might be said, as an old writer puts it, that the Transfiguration was less a new miracle than the temporary cessation of an habitual miracle; for the veiling of his glory was the real marvel, the Divine restraint which prohibited the illumination of his sacred humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Before them.</span> In their presence. Jesus probably had withdrawn in order to pray in secret, but returned to the waiting three, that they might behold his glory - be "eyewitnesses of his majesty," as St. Peter says (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>). These, indeed, had been heavy with sleep (Luke), but had awoke at his appearance, and beheld the vision in full possession of their senses. St. Matthew mentions specially two points in this transfiguration. <span class="cmt_word">His face did shine as the sun.</span> This recalls the appearance of the Son of man in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." <span class="cmt_word">And his raiment was white as the light.</span> The light which emanated from his body shone through and glorified his very garments. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">sicut nix</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> is read in some few manuscripts in place of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>: but the word is doubtless introduced here from St. Mark (where, however, it is of doubtful genuineness). If this second evangelist received his account from St. Peter, we recognize the simile in the apostle's remembrance of the snow clad peak of Hermon, in whose vicinity the event transpired. No candid reader can fail to acknowledge that it is no subjective vision that is here narrated, no merely inward impression on brain or nerve with nothing external to correspond, but a real, objective occurrence, which was beheld by mortal eyes endued with no supernatural or abnormal powers, except in so far as they were enabled to look on this partial emanation of the Divine effulgence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-3.htm">Matthew 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> The exclamation, thrice repeated (ver. 5), marks the suddenness and unexpectedness of the occurrence. They who now appeared were no delusive, imaginary figures, but real personages, objectively presented to the spectators, in such bodies as appertained to their condition. <span class="cmt_word">Moses and Elias.</span> St. Luke adds, "who appeared in glory," radiant with the light which always accompanies heavenly visitors. Why these two saints were chosen to be present on this momentous occasion may be explained by various considerations. Both these worthies experienced something unparalleled in their departure from this life. Elijah was taken up to heaven without dying; Moses died, indeed, but he was buried by God in an unknown grave, and his body was under the especial care of Michael the archangel (see <a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>), and we know not that it saw corruption. From the unseen world these were brought to do homage to the Messiah - Moses, a type of those blessed spirits who in Paradise await the final consummation, Elijah, a type of the saints who, after the resurrection, perfect in soul and body, shall enter into glory. Here were the representatives of the Law and the prophets, the principal supporters of the old covenant, honouring him who was introducing the new covenant, which was to fulfil and supersede the previous one. Spurious, degraded Judaism rejected Christ's claims; real, orthodox Judaism acknowledged him and reverenced him as the Christ foretold and fort, shadowed, "of whom Moses and the prophets did write" (<a href="../../par/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>). Now, too, it was made manifest that Jesus was not Elias or one of the prophets, as some erroneously had supposed, but different from and superior to all; that he had power over life and death, and could bring whom he would from the unseen World; that the cross and Passion were not degrading, or proofs of weakness, but glorious and triumphant accomplishments of the will or God. The question is asked - How did Peter and the rest recognize the two heavenly visitants? There may have been something conventional in their garb or appearance, which at once identified them; or the apostles may have known them by spiritual intuition or special revelation; or they may have gathered their knowledge from the conversation which they overheard. Anyhow, it was necessary that the two should be recognized, otherwise their  appearance would have lost its significance, and the confirmation which they were intended to afford would fail to be given. Is there here an intimation that in heaven the blessed will know each other, though they never met in the flesh - shall know even as they have been known? <span class="cmt_word">Talking with him.</span> St. Luke tells us the subject of this mysterious dialogue - they "spoke of his decease (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">exodus, departure</span>) which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem." They conversed, not of the glory which was his before the world began, nor of the kingdom which he came to establish, but of his coming suffering and death, with their tremendous issues. At the very moment of this revelation of Divinity, the discourse is of humiliation and the cross. The apostles had been slow to understand the future that awaited their Master; here the great saints of the covenant bore their testimony to Christ's fulfilment of what had been prophesied and shadowed aforehand, how by the sufferings of his sacred humanity eternal glory should be won. So might the apostles be strengthened to look forward without apprehension or weak shrinking; for through the grave and gate of death lay the road to a joyful resurrection and celestial happiness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-4.htm">Matthew 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Peter.</span> According to St. Luke, it was when the two Divine prophets were disappearing, or were being withdrawn from sight, that Peter spoke. Bewildered, overcome with joy and astonishment, not knowing what to say (Mark), yet in his excitement and ardour unable to keep silence, he cries to Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">Lord, it is good for us to be here;</span> perhaps equivalent to <span class="accented">to remain here</span>. He includes Moses and Elias in his eager exclamation. Some commentators confine the reference to the three apostles, as if Peter meant that it was "good" that they were present in order to prepare the necessary habitations. This seems meagre and insufficient. Here were peace, seclusion, safety: might they not last? Was there any need to quit this hallowed spot at once, and lose the heavenly company with which it was blessed? <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou wilt.</span> Even at this supreme moment, he will not set his will in opposition to his Master's. <span class="cmt_word">Let us make</span> (<span class="accented">I will make</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">here three tabernacles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>). Booths, of branches and grass, such as were used by travellers camping out, or such as the people erected when celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. He speaks of but three shelters, regarding only Jesus and the two prophets, and considering himself and his fellow disciples as mere servitors and attendants, for whom no such provision was needed. In his confusion he thinks that if these three remain, they must have some kind of habitation. Like a child, he would fain prolong indefinitely the joy of this great vision; and with a Jew's hankering for a conquering Messiah and the permanence of the old covenant, he desired that from that secure mountain top the laws of the kingdom might be issued, and all men might acknowledge the Christ attended and supported by the great lawgiver and prophet. Was there not also a latent hope that thus might be deferred or laid aside that departure to Jerusalem, with its calamitous consequences? But this was not to be. No answer was vouchsafed to Peter's thoughtless request. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A bright cloud overshadowed them.</span> The cloud spread over and around, not Jesus only and the other two, but in some degree over the apostles also, as St. Luke adds, "They feared as they entered into the cloud." It was the Shechinah, the token of the presence of the Most High, who dwelleth in the unapproachable light. It enshrouded Jesus and his two companions, so that mortal eye could not pierce it or even look upon it; but the apostles, who were outside its immediate contact, were in some sort included in its influence, so that it could be said to overshadow them. St. Peter calls it "the excellent glory (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>). The cloud from which on Sinai the old Law was given, was dark and threatening (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>); this was bright, coming not to terrify, but to teach and to bless. Here is seen the contrast between the two dispensations, the Law and the gospel (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A voice out of the cloud.</span> It was the voice of God the Father, for he called Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">My beloved Son.</span> The same voice, saying the same words, had been heard over the waters of Jordan when Jesus was baptized (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>); it spake once again just before his Passion (<a href="../../par/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a>); at all times witnessing the Father's love and the perfect Divinity of Christ. Now, as before, the Holy Trinity was revealed, the Father speaking with audible voice, the Son standing in radiant light, the Holy Spirit present with the intense brightness of the enveloping cloud. The words heard are fontal in the earlier Scriptures. Thus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> we read, "Behold my Servant, whom I uphold, my Chosen in whom my soul delighteth;" and in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye him.</span> Not Moses and Elias, but Jesus, the Mediator of a better covenant (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). "This voice," St. Peter testifies, "we ourselves heard come out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>). As Edersheim remarks, even if this Epistle is not St. Peter's, it still would represent  the most ancient tradition. "God, having of old spoken unto the fathers in the prophets, hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The command to hear him recalls the saying of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>), that in good time God would raise up from Israel a Prophet like unto himself, and that unto him they shall hearken.

Man's weakness could endure no more; prostrate, paralyzed with fear, they lay on the ground. Who could see God, and live? Had they not seen his glory, and heard his voice?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-8.htm">Matthew 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man, save Jesus only.</span> Moses and Elias had vanished, Jesus was left alone, and the voice Divine said, "Hear him." When at Christ's touch and word the awestruck apostles dared once more to look around and to bethink themselves of what had passed, those were the facts of which they were conscious. The Law and the prophets, types and predictions, are fulfilled in Christ, and are so far superseded. The former were temporary, introductory to the gospel, which is to last forever. Many have seen in the Transfiguration an image and earnest of the future glory of the dead in Christ, when the vile body shall be changed into the likeness of Christ's glorious body, and they shall shine as the sun, and bear the image of the heavenly. So St. Gregory, "He is clothed with light as with a garment, because in that eternal glory he will be clothed with all the saints, to whom it is said, 'Ye are the light of the world.' Whence also it is said by the evangelist, that when the Lord was transfigured in the mountain, his raiment became as snow. In which Transfiguration what else is announced but the glory of the final resurrection? For in the mountain his raiment became as snow, because in the height of heavenly brightness all saints will be joined to him, refulgent with the light of righteousness" ('Moral.,' 32:6). Unbelief has endeavoured to throw discredit on the historical accuracy of the accounts of this great event. It was a dream, an atmospheric disturbance, an unusual play of light and shade, a myth, an allegory; the two heavenly visitants were two unknown disciples with whom Jesus conversed; the three apostles were rapt in a trance, and the vision was purely subjective; these and such like theories have been started by rationalists and enemies of the supernatural, and even by the partially orthodox, as Tertullian ('Adv. Marc., 4:22). There can be no doubt that the evangelists and the Apostle Peter regarded the event as an objective reality, upon which hung momentous truths; and we are content to let it stand or fall with the rest of the facts of the gospel narrative. There is no reason to separate it from the other items of the story. When once the stupendous miracle of the Incarnation is allowed, other wonders follow in natural sequence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they came down from the mountain</span>. The Transfiguration is supposed to have taken place at night, and the following conversation to have passed in the early morning of the next day. <span class="cmt_word">Tell the vision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">what bad been seen</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to no man.</span> This was a strict and formal command. The chosen three were at present not to mention the occurrence to anyone, not even to their fellow disciples. Possibly these would hardly have believed the marvellous tale, and their unbelief would have hardened their heart; or, if they fully credited it, they might have been jealous of the preference shown to some of their company. At any rate, neither they nor others were prepared to receive the great lesson of the scene - that the old covenant had done its work, that the Law and the prophets were superseded and must make way for the new dispensation. Had the story been divulged to the people generally, they would have stumbled at the cross and Passion, which would seem no fitting sequel to this glory (see on Matthew 16:20). <span class="cmt_word">Until the Son of man be risen again</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from the dead.</span> When this great event happened and was known to be the fact, there could be no doubt that Christ was God, and the tale of the Transfiguration would no longer be incredible. Thomas's confession, "My Lord and my God," would be echoed in the heart and conscience of all disciples. St. Luke, though he does not mention Christ's injunction, notifies that it was carefully observed, "They kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen." (These last words, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, explain what St. Matthew above calls "the vision," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>,  the objective spectacle.) The compliance with the injunction shows that they understood something of the spiritual nature of the transaction. We may also note that the prohibition itself is presumptive evidence against the supposed mythical character of the vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-10.htm">Matthew 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why then</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou+n</span>) <span class="cmt_word">say the scribes that Elias must first come?</span> The illative particle "then" shows that the apostles' question arose from something immediately preceding. The connection seems to be this: Elias had just appeared and then had vanished again; how could this visitation be reconciled with the scribes' interpretation of Malachi's prophecy? If Elias was to come before the advent of Messiah, and Jesus is the Messiah, how is it that he has only now shown himself? If he has a work to do on earth, how could he do that when his sojourn was limited to a few minutes' duration, and to the view of so few witnesses? Malachi had spoken of the Messenger who was to precede and prepare the way for Messiah; he had said, "Before the great day of the Lord, I will send you Elijah the prophet" (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>); and the learned among the Jews interpreted these two passages of his appearance in person to herald the approach of Messiah. Hence the perplexity of the apostles, they, like the scribes, not distinguishing the two advents of Christ, and the double allusion in the prophet's announcement - the "Messenger" in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a> being a different personage from "Elias" in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>, though of the same power and spirit. Christ explains the difficulty in the two next verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-11.htm">Matthew 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elias truly shall first</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">cometh</span>). Many of the best manuscripts and editions omit "first." The Vulgate has merely, <span class="accented">Elias quidem venturus est</span>. It is probably inserted in our text from the parallel passage in Mark, where it is certainly genuine. Christ is here alluding to his own second coming, which shall be preceded by the appearance of Elijah in person. This seems to be the plain meaning of the prophecy in Malachi, and of Christ's announcement, and is confirmed by St. John's statement concerning the two witnesses (<a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3, 6</a>). That the paragraph cannot refer to John the Baptist is plain from the tenses used in this verse contrasted with those in the following. To regard ver. 12 as simply a correction of ver. 10 is to do violence to language, and to leave one half of Malachi's prediction unexplained. <span class="cmt_word">Restore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things.</span> The event is still future, and was not fulfilled in the Baptist's preaching, however deep and extensive may have been its influence. Of course, John in a partial degree reproduced the character and acts of Elijah, directing the people to the eternal principles of justice and righteousness, to a reformation of religion and morals; but he could not be said to have reconstituted, re-established all things; though it is possible that, had his message been received and acted upon, some such effects would have been produced. How and in what degree Elijah, again appearing and living on earth, will effect this great achievement, we know not. We can only fall back on the ancient prophecy, which affirms that "he shall turn the heart of the fathers to [or, 'with'] the children, and the heart of the children to [or, 'and'] their fathers" (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>), and expect that in some way, known unto God, he shall convert one and all, young and old, unto the Lord; or unite the Jews who are the fathers in the faith to Christians who are their children, and thus embrace Jew and Gentile in one fold under one Shepherd.

Christ is here speaking of the past, as in the preceding verse he spake of the future. The common Jewish interpretation confused the two events and the two personages, reducing them to one. And this mistake has been committed by many modern expositors. <span class="cmt_word">They knew him not.</span> They did not recognize his true character and the import of his mission. Though they gathered round him and listened to his preaching and denunciations, very few saw in him the precursor of the Messiah, and many, misunderstanding his austere, self-denying life, deemed him to be possessed by a devil (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have done unto him.</span> John suffered a long imprisonment, and was eventually murdered; and though Herod was primarily answerable for these doings, the people were virtually guilty, in that they consented to the injurious treatment and made no effort in his favour. <span class="cmt_word">Likewise...also.</span> Taking occasion from the mention of the Baptist's fate, Jesus foretells his own sufferings and death, endeavouring to make the apostles familiar with the idea of a dying as well as a conquering Messiah.

Indeed, it was something quite new that they should thus at once apprehend Christ's meaning, so slow were they of faith, so unintelligent  in appreciating the full signification of their Master's instructions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-14.htm">Matthew 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a <i>certain</i> man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-21.</span> - <span class="accented">Healing of the demoniac</span> boy.

If this event took place at night, the following morning will be meant. The contrast between the scene on the mountain and that presented by the demoniac below has been seized by Raphael, in his picture of the Transfiguration, at Rome - the last great work that he painted. The upper part of this picture represents Jesus radiant in glory with the heavenly visitants, while the lower panel shows the agonized father, surrounded by the unbelieving crowd, bringing his tortured son to the apostles, who stand helpless and discredited. The painter has, indeed, sacrificed fact to dramatic effect (as the two events were not synchronous); but the lesson enforced thereby is most impressive, and lays holds of the imagination, showing different phases of the life of Christ, and the realms of light and darkness. <span class="cmt_word">There came to him a</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. Things had not gone well while Jesus and the three chief apostles were away on the mount. As during the absence of Moses at Sinai the people had fallen into idolatry (<a href="../../par/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>.), so now, when their Master and their leaders were withdrawn, the nine apostles bad faltered in faith and failed in exercising the miraculous powers bestowed upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Kneeling down to him</span>.

The Revised Version most unnecessarily renders the verb, <span class="accented">he is epileptic</span>. Doubtless the case in many respects simulated epilepsy, and might have been so described; but it seems inexpedient to conceal the actual word used, which gave the popular and probably correct view of one phase of the complaint. Surely a real fact well known to medical science underlies the term <span class="accented">lunacy</span>, in the catalogue of the diseased persons who were brought to Christ to be healed (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>), we find a class called lunatics, distinct from the paralytic and possessed. It is by no means an exploded fallacy that the moon has some mysterious influence on certain constitutions, and produces an aggravation of symptoms in accordance with some of its changes. It was from observation of this phenomenon that this form of insanity was termed <span class="accented">seleniasmus</span> or <span class="accented">lunacy</span>. In the present instance the disease was complicated and of no ordinary nature. The other synoptists state that the child was possessed by a demon. This was the fact which differentiated the malady from any merely organic sickness. It was in truth epilepsy accompanied by or occasioned by demoniacal possession. St. Matthew does not mention the possession in his introductory account, but he afterwards (ver. 18) speaks of the demon departing. <span class="cmt_word">Sore vexed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">is in evil case</span>; suffers grievously. He was affected with terrible paroxysms, which are detailed more at length by Mark and Luke. Matthew narrates some of the effects of the mania upon the victim. <span class="cmt_word">Ofttimes he falleth into the fire.</span> The fits, coming on suddenly and without warning, brought the sufferer into imminent dangers, perhaps produced suicidal tendencies, which urged him to destroy himself.

When the apostles were sent forth with commission to heal the sick, they returned with joy to report the success of their tour: they cast forth many devils; they noted with glad surprise that the very demons were subject to them in the Name of Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17</a>). It was different now. <span class="cmt_word">They could not cure him.</span> What means they used we know not; at any rate, they were ineffectual. The writers who record the failure must be allowed to be truthful and honest. There had been much to depress these disciples. Their Master was absent, gone they knew not whither; how long he would be away they could not tell; the boldest and most trusted of their company were no longer present to cheer them with sympathy, to repel attacks, to stand forth as champions. The scribes' uncompromising disbelief (<a href="../../par/mark/9-16.htm">Mark 9:16</a>) had for the moment obscured their own perfect trust; the atmosphere of infidelity had affected their own breathing; the memory of Christ's words concerning his Passion and death recurred again with dispiriting effect, infusing doubt and disquiet; they bad for the time lost the ardour and confidence which had animated them in their first mission; retaining belief in Christ's claims, they felt a hesitation concerning their own  ability; and the conscious weakness in their exorcism nullified its power, and they could do no mighty work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered.</span> Jesus did not directly respond to the father's appeal, nor repel the Pharisees' scoffs.

How much longer was this to continue? Was this forgetfulness of the past, this dulness of comprehension, to last forever? Did they wish to wear out his long suffering, to exhaust his condescension? With Divine impatience at man's obduracy, he makes this mournful inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">Bring</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">bring ye</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>him hither to me.</span> He speaks to the attendants or the crowd, and bids them bring the boy to him, not to the disciples. The prophet's staff in Gehazi's hand could not awake the dead; Elisha himself must undertake the work (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-31.htm">2 Kings 4:31</a>); so if the desired miracle had to he performed, Christ himself must do it. In spite of his grief and disappointment, he does not withhold relief, in the midst of wrath he remembers mercy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-18.htm">Matthew 17:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus rebuked the devil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">him</span>). Some take the pronoun as masculine, and refer it to the diseased boy; but it is more natural that the rebuke should be addressed to the possessing demon. This is the first place where St. Matthew mentions the spiritual aspect of the malady. As the child was being brought to Jesus, a terrible scene ensued, which is described with its horrific details by St. Mark, who also gives Christ's conversation with the father, whereby he desired to arouse faith in his heart, and to draw that assurance from him which could not be obtained from the irresponsible sufferer. <span class="cmt_word">He departed out of him.</span> In contrast to the faltering exorcism of the apostles, which the devil had disregarded, Jesus orders with the calmness of assured authority, and is at once obeyed. After a final act of defeated malice, the demon quitted his hold of the child. <span class="cmt_word">Was cured from that very hour</span>. Never more to fall under the devil's influence, restored wholly in body and mind. There is something very mysterious in the sufferings of this poor boy, as there is in those of infants. It is plain that the description, "epileptic mania," will not connote all the features of this case. The evangelists' narrative and Christ's words and actions conclusively prove that it had a demoniacal element, and that this was miraculously eliminated. For epilepsy, I believe, no cure is known. The suddenness and the permanence (<a href="../../par/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25</a>) of the relief further demonstrate the reality of the miracle. We learn also from this incident that all possessed persons were not morally evil, that often the possession appertained to the physical and psychical nature, and had no ethical relation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-19.htm">Matthew 17:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Apart</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).

The Lord's rebuke (ver. 17) had passed over their heads, and not been understood as applicable to themselves. So it was with some bitterness that they asked the question. The nine had not been permitted to witness the Transfiguration; they were not even to be made acquainted with this wondrous transaction at present. More preparation, greater receptivity, was required, before they were fit to be admitted to the full mysteries of the kingdom. They had still much to learn, were still only pupils, and their late failure was permitted in order to help them to attain to self-knowledge and more entire self-surrender.

Jesus gives two reasons for the apostles' failure, one connected with their own moral condition, and one (ver. 21) derived from the nature of the demons exorcised. They had, indeed, shown some faith by making even the attempt at the expulsion of the devil, and were not to be classed with the unbelieving scribes; but they had acted in a half-hearted manner, and had not   displayed that perfect confidence and trust which alone can win success and make all things possible. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> The Lord proceeds to give that lesson concerning perfect faith and its results, which he afterwards repeated in connection with the withered fig tree (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>, where see note) and elsewhere (<a href="../../par/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,</span> which, as he says (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>), "is less than all seeds." He means a faith real and trustful, though it be small and weak. The phrase is proverbial, expressive of littleness and insignificance. The mustard seed is quite little, but, grown in favourable soil and under sunny skies, it becomes, as it were, a tree among herbs, so that birds may nestle in its branches. To it faith is compared, because, small at first, it contains within itself power of large development and increase; from minute grains copious results are produced. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall say unto this mountain.</span> He points to the hill of Hermon, where the Transfiguration had taken place. <span class="cmt_word">Remove hence.</span> It is usual to consider the expression here as an Eastern hyperbole, not to be taken literally, but meaning merely that the greatest difficulties may be overcome by faith. This may be true, but it seems hardly adequate to the explanation of our Lord's emphatic words. St. Paul writes in a similar strain (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>), "If I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains;" where there is nothing necessarily hyperbolical in the supposition. It seems rather that Jesus meant his words to be received literally, implying that if such a removal as he mentioned was ever expedient and in accordance with God's will, it would be effected by the power of faith; not that he hereby sanctioned an arbitrary and wanton display of miraculous power, but he gives an assurance that, were such a measure rendered necessary for the cause of religion, it would be performable at the call of one whose whole trust was centred on God, and whose will was one with God's will. Mediaeval writers, followed by later Roman Catholic commentators, give instances of such stupendous effects of faith. The evidence of such miracles is, of course, defective, and would not satisfy modern criticism, but the existence of such legends proves that a literal view was taken of our Lord's saying. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span> The man of faith is practically omnipotent; moral and material difficulties vanish before him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-21.htm">Matthew 17:21</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse is omitted in many good manuscripts and by the Revised Version, it being considered to have been introduced from the parallel passage of St. Mark.

But the latter interpretation is excluded by the fact that the apostles had already exercised successfully their power over devils without special prayer or fasting. The words point to a truth in the spiritual world, that there are different degrees in the Satanic hierarchy (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>); some demons are more malignant than others, and have greater power over the souls of men. In the present case the possession was of long standing; it revolved a terrible bodily malady; it was of an intense and unusual character. The mere word of exorcism, or the name of Jesus, spoken with little spiritual faith, could net overcome the mighty enemy. The exorcist needed special preparation; he must inspire and augment his faith by prayer and self-discipline. Prayer invokes the aid of God, and puts one's self unreservedly in his hands; fasting subdues the flesh, arouses the soul's energies, brings into exercise the higher parts of man's nature. Thus equipped, a man is open to receive power from on high, and can quell the assaults of the evil one.

Jesus reiterates the prediction continually in order to familiarize his followers with the unwelcome, the incredible, reality.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute <i>money</i> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The coin in the fish's mouth</span>. This is one of the three miracles of our Lord which are peculiar to this Gospel St. Matthew seems to concern himself particularly with matters which present Jesus as King-Messiah; and this occurrence was in his view specially notable, as herein Christ claimed for himself a royal position - Son in his Father's house. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Capernaum</span>. Once more before the final scene he visited the spot so dear to his human heart - "his own city." <span class="cmt_word">They that received tribute money</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). This is an unfortunate rendering, as it may be taken to countenance an erroneous view of the demanded impost, found in many ancient and some modern commentaries, which vitiates their whole interpretation. According to this opinion, the tribute was a civil payment, like the <span class="accented">denarius</span> of <a href="../../par/matthew/22-19.htm">Matthew 22:19</a>, levied by the Roman government, or a capitation tax imposed by Herod, the Tetrarch of Galilee (of which tax, however, we have no historical proof). That this is a misunderstanding is plain from many considerations. In the first place, the collectors are not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, publicans, but quite another set of people, called <span class="accented">they that received the didrachmas</span>. Again, the officers of government would not have made their demand mildly in an interrogative form, "Doth not your Master," etc.? but would have exhibited that violent and offensive behaviour which made them so hated among the Jews. The political tax is never termed <span class="accented">didrachma</span>, but always <span class="accented">census</span>, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17, 19</a>; nor could Jesus have given the answer which is reported below, if the tax had been one levied in the interest of any earthly monarch, be it Caesar or Herod. <span class="accented">The didrachma</span> is a term denoting a well known rate, concerning which we have full information from many sources - biblical, Talmudic, and traditional. The <span class="accented">didrachma</span> was a silver coin equal to two Attic drachms, or, in Jewish money, to one half shekel of the sanctuary - something under our florin in weight. It was the amount of an ecclesiastical rate levied for religious purposes. Originally (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>, etc.) exacted as an acknowledgment and a thank offering, a ransom, as it were, for the lives rescued from Egypt, it had been used in the wilderness in providing the framework of the tabernacle and the ornamentation of its pillars. Based on this practice arose a custom that every male Israelite of twenty years old and upwards should annually contribute to the temple treasury the sum of a half shekel. Dr. Edersheim reckons the tribute in our Lord's time to have been equivalent to &pound;75,000 per annum. The money was stored in the temple treasury, and was expended partly in the purchase of the daily sacrifices, victims, incense, etc., in the payment of rabbis and other officials connected with the temple, in maintaining the efficiency of the water supply, and in keeping in repair the vast and magnificent buildings in the temple area. After all this outlay, there was always a large sum in hand, which proved a strong temptation to the greed of conquerors, and the sacred coffers were often plundered; and even after many previous spoliations, we read that Crassus ( <span class="date">B.C. 54</span>) carried off no less than two and a half millions sterling. The tax was due by the twenty-fifth of the month Adar (equivalent to February March), and the collectors who were appointed to or took upon themselves the office, opened stalls in; every country town for the reception of the money. For many centuries the rate was of a voluntary nature, considered, indeed, a religious duty, and to be evaded by no one, Pharisee or Sadducee, who wished to be regarded as an orthodox believer, but its payment had not been secured by any legal process. Lately, indeed, the penalty of distraint had been enacted in order to obtain the tax from defaulters; but it is doubtful whether this was generally enforced. Possibly the appointed day had now arrived, and the collectors thought right to stir in the matter. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Peter.</span> They applied to Peter instead of directly to Christ, perhaps out of respect for the latter, and from a certain awe with which he inspired them. Besides, Peter was their fellow townsman, and they doubtless knew him well His natural impulsiveness might have induced <span class="accented">him</span> to answer the call. It may also have been his own house, the other eleven being apparently staying with other friends, and Jesus with him ("me and thee," ver. 27). We may suppose that Jesus had complied with the demand on former occasions, when sojourning in his Galilaean home, so that the present application was only natural. <span class="cmt_word">Doth</span> <span class="cmt_word">not your Master</span> (<span class="greek_word">o( Dida/skalo u(mw  =  n</span>, <span class="accented">your Teacher</span>) <span class="cmt_word">pay tribute</span> (<span class="accented">the didrachma</span>)? Perhaps the form of the question might be better rendered, "Your Teacher pays the two drachms, does he not?" The pronoun "your" is plural, because they recognized  that Jesus was at the head of a band of disciples, who would be influenced by his example. We may in this inquiry see other motives besides the obvious one. If Jesus paid the rate now without question, he would prove that he was nothing more than an ordinary Jew, with no claim to a higher origin or a Divine mission. Though not a priest or Levite, Jesus might have claimed exemption as a recognized rabbi, and the collectors may have desired to ascertain whether he would do this. There was, too, at this time a sect which, in its furious patriotism, refused to contribute aught to the temple so long as the holy city was profaned by the presence of the heathen. Did Christ belong to this body? And would he carry out their programme? If from any cause he declined the contribution, this abstention would give a handle to those who were not prepared to endorse his claims: the breach of such a generally recognized obligation would raise a prejudice against him, and weaken the effect of his acts and teaching. Some such motives may have contributed to inspire the question now asked. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a></div><div class="verse">He saith, Yes.

But was there not another feeling that dictated the quick reply, and made him pledge Jesus to the payment? He had a fear at his heart, caused by Christ's late warning and prophecy, that made him morbidly anxious to live at peace with all men at this conjuncture. As far as in him lay he would shield his beloved Master from the dread result which he anticipated; at any rate, he would endeavour to postpone the fatal day; no offence that he could obviate should be given. So, thinking only of present safety, forgetting or wilfully ignoring Christ's true position, he answered hastily, "Yes." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>When he</span> (Peter) <span class="cmt_word">was come into the house.</span> The collectors had addressed Peter in the street or at the door, and the apostle, having given his reply, hastened into the house where Jesus was, either to obtain the necessary coins or to make the demand known. <span class="cmt_word">Prevented him.</span> The Revised Version paraphrases, <span class="accented">spake first to him</span>, which gives the meaning (though the Greek does not warrant such translation) - Jesus anticipated what Peter was going to say by showing that he knew the apostle's thoughts and all that had passed outside the house, he takes the opportunity of enforcing a needful lesson, making the listener, in the Socratic method, teach himself. <span class="cmt_word">What thinkest thou, Simon?</span> By such familiar address he claims his attention. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth</span>. He contrasts these with the King of heaven, to whom a reference is implied in the Lord's subsequent words. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) or tribute (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The former of these words (which would be better rendered <span class="accented">tolls</span>) signifies the customs laid on goods and merchandise and other such payments - <span class="accented">vectigalia</span>, as the Romans called them; the <span class="accented">tribute</span> (not the same word as that so translated in ver. 24) is the <span class="accented">census</span>, the capitation tax (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) imposed upon every citizen of the empire. <span class="cmt_word">Strangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-26.htm">Matthew 17:26</a></div><div class="verse">Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of strangers.</span> Peter is brought to the desired point. He answers, as any one would, that in earthly kingdoms the children of the ruling monarch are exempt from taxes, which are exacted from all other subjects. <span class="cmt_word">Then are the children free.</span> The comparison required the use of the plural, though the reference is properly confined to himself. The deduction leads naturally to the lesson of Christ's immunity, he virtually implies (though the inference is not developed in words), "I am the Son of God, as you, Peter, have acknowledged; this tax is levied for the house and service of God, whose Son I am; therefore I am free from the obligation of paying it; it cannot be required that I should pay tribute to my Father." Looked at in its original nature, the impost could not with propriety be demanded from him. It was an offering of atonement, a ransom of souls. How could he give money in expiation of himself - he who had come to give his life a ransom for others? Why should he ransom himself from sin and death, who had come to take away sin and destroy death and open everlasting life to all men? There was need to make the point clear now that Christ had openly asserted his Messiahship and his Divine nature. To pay the demamt without explanation, after the statement of his Divinity, might occasion serious misapprehension in the minds of his followers. So he gently but convincingly shows that his claim of Sonship exempted him from all liability of the impost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a></div><div class="verse">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest we should offend them;</span> <span class="accented">cause them to stumble</span>. In his large charity he would not take the advantage of his position to avoid the tax. Though above the Law, he would place himself under the Law. Offence would be given by the nonpayment. His motive would be unknown and misunderstood (see on ver. 24). The people would attribute it to caprice, sectarianism, contempt of religion; they would  see in it dishonour to the temple. Suspicion and animosity would be aroused; ill feeling, injurious both to themselves who encouraged it and to the cause of Christ, would weaken the effects of his acts and doctrine. Further offence would supervene if he did not confirm Peter's engagement and execute the promise which the foremost disciple had virtually made in his name; since it might thus appear that he and his followers were not of one mind in this important matter. For such considerations he was content to waive his prerogative, and to provide for the payment by a miracle, which should at once vindicate his royal character and demonstrate that, while he was obedient to the Law, he was superior to it, was the Lord of heaven and earth and sea. <span class="cmt_word">Go thou to the sea.</span> The Sea of Galilee, on whose shore Capernaum stood, and with which Peter had been all his life familiar. <span class="cmt_word">Cast an hook.</span> The fisherman was to ply his trade, yet not to use his customary net; he was to fish with line and hook, that the miracle might be more striking. <span class="cmt_word">Take up the fish that first cometh up.</span> From the deep waters to the bait. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt find a piece of money;</span> <span class="accented">a stater</span>. This Greek coin, circulating throughout the East, was about equal in value to the shekel, or two didrachms, and therefore sufficient to pay the half shekel for two persons. That fish should seize a bright object which might drop into the sea is nothing uncommon. A cod has been found with a watch in its stomach, still going. The miracle is shown in the omniscience which knew what the fish carried in its maw, and in the omnipotence which drew it to the hook. As far as we know, and regarding the present age as the sabbath of creation (see <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), Christ in his miracles created nothing absolutely, always using a natural and existing basis as the support of the wonder. So here he does not create the fish or the skater, but by marvellous coincidences makes them subserve his purpose. Tradition has stereotyped the miracle by assigning to a certain tribe of fish a permanent mark of the occurrence. <span class="accented">The johndory</span>. whose name is corrupted either from <span class="accented">jaune dore</span>, "gold colour," or <span class="accented">adore</span>, "worshipped," is called in some countries Peter's fish, and is supposed to retain the impression of the apostle's fingers on its sides. Others assert that it is the haddock which presents this memorial of the miracle. But neither of these fish is found in the Lake of Gennesareth. <span class="cmt_word">Give...  for me and thee</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)nti\ e)mou  =   kai\ sou  =  </span>). The form of expression recalls the original design of the institution, as a ransom of souls (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> in the Greek). He does not say, "for us;" for, though he submitted to the tax, it was not on the same ground as his servant. He himself paid, though exempt; Peter paid because he was liable. In the one ease it was from humility, in the other from legal obligation. The account ends somewhat abruptly, nothing being said of the result of the Lord's command, what action Peter took, and what ensued thereon. But we need no assurance that all came to pass as Christ directed. The very silence is significant; it is the sublimest language. Neologian criticism has endeavoured to explain away or to throw discredit on the miraculous nature of this "transaction." We are asked to believe that Christ by his command meant only that Peter was to go and catch a fish and sell it for a skater. If this was the case, why did not the evangelist say so? Why did he introduce a story which he must have known to be untrue? Is there any ground for supposing that St. Matthew was a writer of myths and legends, or one who intentionally falsified the records on which he framed his history? Surely no unprejudiced person could judge thus of the writer of the First Gospel; to those who believe in inspiration the notion is sacrilegious. The incident is no embellishment of a natural fact, no mere sailor's anecdote, but the true account of a real occurrence, which the narrator credited and probably witnessed. Another allegation equally unfounded is that Christ was rebuking Peter for precipitancy in promising payment when they had no funds in their possession, as though Jesus was saying ironically, "You had better go and catch a fish, and look for the money in its mouth!" Such attempted evasions of the miraculous are puerile and saddening. And if it be objected, as indeed it is, that the miracle was unnecessary and unworthy of Jesus, who never exerted his supernatural power for his own benefit, it is easy to show that the wonder was required in order to give and enforce a lesson to Peter and his companions. In what better way could Jesus have conveyed to them the truth that, although for the nonce he consented to the Law, he was superior to it and exempt from the obligation, and that if he paid the tax he did so by an exercise of power which proved him to be the Son of God? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/18.htm"><title>Matthew 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/17.htm" title="Matthew 17">&#9668;</a> Matthew 18 <a href="../matthew/19.htm" title="Matthew 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-35.</span> - <span class="accented">Discourse concerning the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and the mutual duties of Christians</span>. (<a href="../../par/mark/9-33.htm">Mark 9:33-50</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-46.htm">Luke 9:46-50</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - <span class="accented">The greatest in the kingdom of heaven</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At</span> <span class="cmt_word">the same time</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in that hour</span>. The narrator connects the following important discourse with the circumstances just previously related. Peter had completed the business of the didrachma, and had rejoined the body of disciples. These, according to St. Mark, had disputed about precedency on the way to Capernaum. Fired with the notion that their Master would ere long publicly assert his Messianic claims, which, in their view, implied temporal sovereignty and secular power, they looked forward to becoming dignitaries in this new kingdom. Three of them had been honoured with special marks of favour; one of them had been pre-eminently distinguished: how would it be when the coming empire was established? This had been the subject of conversation, and had given rise to some contention among them. Christ had marked the dispute, but had said nothing at the time. Now he gives them a lesson in humility, and teaches the spiritual nature of his kingdom, in which earthly pride and ambition find no place. From St. Mark we learn that Jesus himself took the initiative in the discourse, asking the disciples concerning their disputation on the road; and,  when they were ashamed to answer, he added, "If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all." Our Gospel here takes up the story. The paradox seemed incomprehensible; so they put the question, <span class="cmt_word">Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</span> The Greek is, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.; <span class="accented">who then is greater?</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quis, putas, major est?</span> The illative particle "then" refers to what is recorded in St. Mark (Mark 9:34), or to some such difficulty in the querists' mind. They make the inquiry in the present tense, as though Christ had already selected the one who was to preside; and by <span class="accented">the kingdom of heaven</span> they mean the Messianic kingdom on earth, concerning which their notions did not yet rise above those of their contemporaries (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). The comparative in the original, "greater," is virtually equivalent to the superlative, as it is translated in the Authorized Version. Such a question as the above could not have been asked had the apostles at this time recognized any absolute pre-eminence in Peter or acknowledged his supremacy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A little child.</span> Our Lord teaches, not only by spoken parables, but by symbolical actions also.

Eccl.,' 2:35), asserts that this child was the famous martyr Ignatius. <span class="cmt_word">Set him in the midst of them.</span> Taking him in his arms, as St. Mark tells. What a picture of Christ's tenderness and human love! From the boy's trustfulness and submission he draws a needed lesson for the ambitious apostles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be converted</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. turned from proud, ambitious thoughts of worldly dignity. There is no question here about what is popularly known as conversion - the change from habitual sin to holiness. The conversion here spoken of is confined to a change in the present state of mind - to a new direction given to the thoughts and wishes. The apostles had shown rivalry, jealousy, ambition: they must turn away from such failings, and learn a different lesson. <span class="cmt_word">Become as little children.</span> Christ points to little children as the model to which the members of his kingdom must assimilate themselves. The special attributes of children which he would recommend are humility, unworldliness, simplicity, teachableness, - the direct contraries of self-seeking, worldliness, distrust, conceit. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not enter.</span> In the sermon on the mount Christ had said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). To all who are not such the gate opens not. That virtue which was unknown to pagan antiquity, the opposite character to which was upholden as the acme of excellence, Christ here asserts to be the only passport to his ideal Church on earth or its eternal development in heaven. Not the self-esteeming, proud man (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Aristotle's worship ('Eth. Nic.,' 4:3), but the humble (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), the lowly, the self-depreciating, is the man who can realize his position in the spiritual world, and shall be admitted to its blessings and benefits. St. Paul has summarized the ideal character of the members of the kingdom in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, especially vers. 4, 5, and 7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-4.htm">Matthew 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever therefore.</span> This verse gives a direct application of the principle just enunciated, and supplies an answer to the apostles' question. <span class="cmt_word">Shall humble himself.</span> Not that a child consciously humbles itself, but is humble by nature. The disciple must become that by deliberate choice which the child is by reason of his constitution and natural disposition. <span class="cmt_word">The same is</span> <span class="cmt_word">greatest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">greater</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), Christ using the same term as the questioners in ver. 1. The more a man annihilates self and casts away pride, conceit, obstinacy, the fitter is he to become a living member of Christ's kingdom. "Quanto humilior, tanto altior," says Thomas Aquinas. But this is a joint work. St. Gregory says well, "The good which a man doeth is both the work of God and the work of man: of God, as being the Author, in giving grace; of man, as being actor, in using grace, yet so that he cooperate with grace by grace" (quoted by Ford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-5.htm">Matthew 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - <span class="accented">The treatment due to such</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall receive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The word is pregnant with meaning. It includes not only the showing of tender affection and the giving of material succour, such as hospitality, shelter, etc., but also the bestowal of help and support in spiritual things, encouragement in holiness, instruction in Divine lore. <span class="cmt_word">One such little child</span>. Primarily, Jesus refers to children, pure and confiding as the one he had placed in the midst; but his words are applicable to all who have the childlike spirit and character, the graces which he specially loves and rewards. The expressions here and in the next verse must be understood to belong in some cases to the symbol, and in others to the symbolized. <span class="cmt_word">In my Name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">for the sake of my Name</span>; because he belongs to me; not merely from natural affection and pity, but from a higher motive, because the child has in him somewhat of Christ - is the child of God, and a member of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Receiveth me.</span> That which is done to his little ones Christ regards as done to himself (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40-42</a>). What a blessing waits on those who teach the young, working laboriously in schools, and training souls for heaven!  This "receiving" Christ is a far higher and better thing than being "greatest" in an earthly kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and <i>that</i> he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - There is an opposite side to this picture. <span class="cmt_word">Shall offend;</span> <span class="accented">cause to stumble</span> - give occasion for a fall, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either in faith or morals. This is done by evil example, by teaching to sin, by sneers at piety, by giving soft names to gross offences. <span class="cmt_word">One of these little ones.</span> Whether child or adult, a pure, simple soul, which has a certain faith it be not strong enough to resist all attack. Even the heathen recognized the respect due to the young: "Maxima debetur puero reverentia" (Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:47); and guilelessness and purity, wherever found, win some regard, even from worthless and careless observers. To wilfully lead one such astray is a deadly sin, which the Lord denounces in solemn terms. Christ affectionately calls his disciples "little ones" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believe in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>.

Says St. Augustine, "Credimus Paulo, sed non credimus in Paulum." In the present passage the phrase implies the Divinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">It were better;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is profitable</span>. The crime specified is so heinous that a man had better incur the most certain death, if by this means he may avoid the sin and save the soul of his possible victim. <span class="cmt_word">A millstone;</span> <span class="accented">a great millstone</span> - such a one as required an ass to inure. The upper, or movable, stone is meant, which was usually turned by the hand. <span class="cmt_word">Drowned</span>. We do not know that the Jews punished criminals by drowning (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), though it is probable that it was practised in some cases; but by other nations this penalty was commonly exacted. Among the Romans, Greeks, and Syrians, it was certainly the practice. Commentators quote Suetonius, 'Aug.,' 67; Diod. Sic., 16:35; Livy, 1:51; Aristophanes, 'Schol. ad Equit.,' 1360. The punishment seems to have been reserved for the greatest criminals; and the size of the stone would prevent any chance of the body rising again to the surface and being buried by friends - a consideration which, in the minds of heathens, greatly increased the horror of this kind of death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-7.htm">Matthew 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - This and the preceding verse occur in St. Luke (Luke 17:1, 2) in an inverted order. <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto the world!</span> The Lord thinks of the deadly evil brought into the world by offences given, such as bad example, unholy lives of Christians, persecutions, scoffs, thoughtlessness - things which lead so many astray. <span class="cmt_word">For it must needs be.</span> While men are what they are, such consequences must be expected. This is not an absolute, but a relative, necessity. Man's heart is evil, his tendencies are evil, temptation is strong. Satan is active; all these forces combine to bring about a fatal result. Thus St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>), "There must be heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you." So these offences of which Christ speaks are overruled and permitted for wise purposes, that by them the righteous may be proved and purified, and the chaff separated from the wheat. <span class="cmt_word">But woe to that man!</span> Because of this evil principle which is rife in the world, no man is exonerated from the guilt of giving offence. He has free will; he can choose good; he can use the means of grace; he can strengthen his natural weakness, control his perverseness, overcome corruption, by the help of God always ready to be given to them who seek. The first "woe" is a cry of pity for a world in danger; the second "woe" is a denunciation of the sinner as being responsible for the evil which he introduces. We are all in some sort our brothers' keepers, and are bound to help forward their salvation, and to do nothing which may tend to endanger their souls' health. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast <i>them</i> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>. The Lord teaches how to avoid this sin of giving offence, repeating the solemn words already delivered in the sermon on the mount, though with some variation and a different context (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29, 30</a>). The reference on the former occasion was especially to breaches of the seventh commandment; here the Lord speaks <span class="cmt_word">of</span> offences in general, of that external corruption among mankind which is the fruitful source of temptation and sin. The only remedy for this is the sternest self-denial, the strictest watchfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Or thy foot.</span> Christ did not name this member in his previous discourse. Literally, the hand or foot leads into sin, when it is directed to forbidden objects, moves towards the acquisition of things contrary to the Law of God. Metaphorically, the expression signifies all that is as dear and as necessary as these important members. Such occasions of sin we must at once and absolutely cast aside. It includes also persons as well as things. Friends the dearest must be parted from if their presence, or conversation, or habits cause evil thoughts or encourage evil acts. In the presence of such offences, ties the nearest must be snapped asunder. Loneliness, isolation, is better than companionship in wickedness. It has been well said by Olshausen that the hand and the foot may denote mental powers and dispositions; and the warning is given that their over-cultivation may prove an obstacle to the spiritual life, and must be accordingly checked. We may also descry in the paragraph an  admonition against making too much of skill, dexterity, and adroitness in business and occupation. There is a subtle snare in them; they may draw the heart away from God, and must be restrained and modified, so as not to interfere with the cultivation of religion and the care of the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Enter into life.</span> This is an addition not found in the sermon on the mount; it refers to the eternal life which, beginning on earth, is consummated in heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Everlasting fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the first time that this phrase occurs. Whatever these words may mean, there can be no doubt that they signify, and are intended to signify, some awful kind and extent of punishment, the fear of which may deter from such sins as incur it. It is not morally expedient to minimize the force of such terms by disputing about the exact connotation of "aeonian." When we remember that the words are spoken by the loving and pitiful Saviour, we must allow that they point to some dreadful reality, the import of which he knew, and which he thus mercifully veiled from us as not able to bear the full revelation (see on Matthew 25:46). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-9.htm">Matthew 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <i>it</i> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell fire.</span> A synonym for the "everlasting fire" of the previous verse, and the "unquenchable fire" of the Baptist's warning (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), and to be understood in the same sense. It is good to be saved even with the loss of all that makes earthly life happy and precious. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - From this verse to the end of the chapter we find no parallel in the other evangelists. The Saviour here returns to the subject of children, whether literally or metaphorically so called, and proclaims the high appreciation which is their due. <span class="cmt_word">Take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">see</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that ye despise not one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of these little ones.</span> God's care is minute; it extends to each individual of the class. The contempt denounced might arise in various ways and from various considerations. The advanced believer might despise children as hot competent to enter into covenant with God or fit to receive Church privileges, whereas circumcision under the old dispensation and infant baptism under the gospel afford a very different view. Again, to say or do unseemly things in the presence of children is a mode of" despising" which may prove a deadly offence. Or the contempt may be on the side of the ambitious and self-seeking, who cannot understand the simple and childlike spirit which seeketh not its own. The Lord gives two proofs of the high consideration due to his little ones. The first proof is that which follows; the second is given in vers. 11-14. <span class="cmt_word">Their angels.</span> Not "their spirits after death," as some commentators erroneously interpret (for the term "angel" is not so used, and Christ speaks in the present tense, <span class="cmt_word">do always behold</span>), but the angels especially appointed to watch and protect them - their guardian angels. This doctrine (which, as of very solemn import, the Lord introduces with his usual formula, <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span>), that each soul has assigned to it by God a special angel is grounded on this, and supported by many other passages of Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7, 10</a>). It has been questioned how angels can be said to succour us on earth, while <span class="cmt_word">in heaven</span> they are always looking on the face of the Father. The difficulty has been answered, among others, by St. Gregory, who writes, "They never so go forth apart from the vision of God, as to be deprived of the joys of interior contemplation. They are both sent from him, and stand by him too, since both in that they are circumscribed, they go forth, and in this that they are also entirely present, they never go away. Thus they at the same time always behold the Father's face, and yet come to us; because they both go forth to us in a spiritual presence, and yet keep themselves there, whence they had gone out, by virtue of interior contemplation" ('Moral.,' 2:3). It is probable that the highest order of angels is here signified, such as among the Jews was called, "the angels of the presence, or of the face." To behold the king's face means, in Eastern parlance, to be admitted to his immediate presence - to enjoy his special favour and confidence (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>). It is to these supreme beings, who draw their knowledge and love directly from Almighty God, and receive their commands from his mouth, that the tender lambs of Christ's flock are committed. This fact demonstrates their dignity and the great heinousness of setting a stumbling block in their way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - This verse is omitted by the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts, and many modern editors, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Lachmann, Tischendort, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and the Revised Version; but is retained in many good uncials, nearly all the cursives, the Vulgate, Syriac, etc. It is supposed to be an interpolation from <a href="../../par/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>; but one does not see why, if this is the case, the inter-polater should have left out the striking verb "to seek," which would naturally have coincided with "seeketh" in ver. 12. For expository use, at any rate, we may consider the verse as genuine, and take it as the commencement of the second argument for the dignity of the little ones - the simple and humble, whether children or others. This proof is derived from the action of God towards them. <span class="cmt_word">The Son of man is come to save that which was lost</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). How can ye despise those whom Christ hath so loved and deemed so precious that he  emptied himself of his glory and became man in order to save them? The general term, " that which was lost," is expressed by the neuter participle, to show that there is no exception to the wide scope of Christ's mercy. The race of man is lost; infants are born in sin; all need redemption. Everybody, poor, helpless, ignorant, tempted, comes under this category, and to save such Christ came down from heaven. Therefore their souls are very precious in his sight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The parable that follows teaches the same lesson as the preceding verse. It is found in <a href="../../par/luke/15-1.htm">Luke 15:1-7</a>, with some variations, delivered to a different audience and under different circumstances, as Jesus often repeated his instructions and teaching according to the occasion. <span class="cmt_word">How think ye?</span> What say ye to the following case? Thus the Lord engages the disciples' attention. <span class="cmt_word">An hundred sheep.</span> A round number, representing a considerable flock. If but one of these stray, the good Shepherd regards only the danger and possible destruction of this wanderer, and puts aside every other care in order to secure its safety. <span class="cmt_word">The ninety and nine.</span> These must be left for a time, if he is to conduct the search in person. It may he that some idea of probation is here intended, as when Jesus let the disciples embark on the lake while he himself remained on the shore. Many of the Fathers interpret the ninety-nine as representing the sinless angels, the lost sheep as man, to seek and save whom Christ left heaven, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. became incarnate. This, indeed, may be a legitimate application of the parable, but is inexact as an exposition of the passage, which regards the whole flock as figuring the human race. The sheep that remained safe and true to their Master are the righteous; the errant are the sinners, which, however few, are the special care of the merciful Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Into the mountains</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>). There is much doubt whether these words are to be joined with <span class="cmt_word">goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in both our versions, or with <span class="cmt_word">leave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nonne</span> <span class="accented">relinquit nonaginta novem in montibus?</span> In the former case we have a picture of the toil of the shepherd traversing the mountains in search of the lost. But this does not seem to be the particular point contemplated, nor is any special emphasis assigned to this part of the transaction. In the parable as recounted by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>), we read, "Doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go?" So here it is best to render, <span class="accented">Doth he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains?</span> The shepherd is not regardless of the safety and comfort of the flock during his temporary absence; he leaves them where they are sure to find pasture, as they roam over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> with accusative) the hill tops, which, catching clouds and dew, are never without fresh grass. So <a href="../../par/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>, "Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains." <span class="cmt_word">Seeketh</span>. The lost sheep would not return of itself. Such erring souls Jesus seeks by the inspiration of his Spirit, by allowing distress and sorrow, by awakening conscience and memory, by ways manifold which may lead the sinner to "come to himself." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-13.htm">Matthew 18:13</a></div><div class="verse">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that <i>sheep</i>, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If so be that he find it.</span> The quest is not sure to he rewarded. Man's perversity makes the result uncertain. No one may safely go on sinning, or living in careless unconcern, with the expectation of being finally found and saved. There is a limit to the patience of the Lord. If a man will not open his heart to good inspirations and cooperate with preventing grace, he will not be found and brought home. God forces no one to be saved against his will. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoiceth more.</span> A natural feeling. Thus a mother loves better an afflicted child whom she has nursed through a long malady, than the strong and healthy children who have caused her no trouble and anxiety. The joy at the recovery of the strayed sheep is proportional to the sorrow occasioned by its loss and the pains and trouble expended in the search; and this pleasure would at the moment be greater than the satisfaction with which the other members of the flock are regarded. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even so.</span> The teaching of the parable is summed up; the conduct of the earthly shepherd is a figure of that of the heavenly Shepherd. <span class="cmt_word">The will of your Father...  perish.</span> To scandalize one of these little ones, or lead him into sin (which is to cause to perish), is to fight against God's will, who would have all men to be saved (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). "When the dignity of the little ones was asserted, it was <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, 'my Father;' now that a motive directly acting on the conscience of the Christian is urged, it is <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>your</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father"</span> (Alford). St. Paul teaches that Christ died for the weak brethren (<a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-11.htm">1 Corinthians 8:11</a>). With this text (ver. 14) before him, it is inconceivable that any one can hold the doctrine of the eternal reprobation of certain souls. The whole passage is opposed to the theory of irrespective predestination and irresistible grace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Correction of an offending brother</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Hitherto the discourse has warned against offending the young and weak; it now teaches how to behave when the offence is directed against one's self. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, "now," introducing a new subject) <span class="cmt_word">if thy brother shall trespass against</span>  <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;</span>). The brother is a brother in the faith, a fellow Christian. The words, "against thee," are omitted in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts, and by some modern editors, on the ground that it is a gloss derived from Peter's question (ver. 21). The words are retained by the Vulgate and other high authorities. Without them, the passage becomes one of a general nature, applying to all offences. Retaining them, we find a direction how to treat one who offers personal offence to ourselves - which seems to suit the context best. In the case of private quarrels between individual Christians, with the view of reconciliation, there are four steps to be taken. First, private remonstrance: <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>. Do not wait for him to come to you; make the first advances yourself. This, as being the more difficult course, is expressly enjoined on one who is learning the lesson of humility. <span class="cmt_word">Tell him his fault;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>,: <span class="accented">corripe eum</span>. Put the fault plainly before him, show him how he has wronged you, and how he has offended God. This must be done in private, gently, mercifully. Such treatment may win the heart, while public rebuke, open denunciation, might only incense and harden. Plainly, the Lord primarily contemplates quarrels between individual Christians; though, indeed, the advice here and in the sequel is applicable to a wider sphere and to more important occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast gained thy brother.</span> If he shall own his fault, and ask for pardon, thou hast won him for God and thyself. A quarrel is a loss to both parties; a reconciliation is a gain for both. The verb "to gain" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) is used elsewhere in this high sense (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a></div><div class="verse">But if he will not hear <i>thee, then</i> take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - This gives the second step or stage in discipline. <span class="cmt_word">Take with thee one or two more.</span> If the offender is obdurate to secret remonstrance, do not yet resort to public measures, but make a fresh effort accompanied by a friend or two, who will support your view and confirm your expostulation, which might otherwise be considered partial or self-interested. <span class="cmt_word">In the mouth of two or three witnesses.</span> The idea is derived from the requirement of the Jewish Law in a case of litigation (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). By the testimony of these witnesses, <span class="cmt_word">every</span> <span class="cmt_word">word</span> that has passed between you may be fully certified. There will be forthcoming, if necessary, the regular legal evidence, should the matter come to other ears. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a></div><div class="verse">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell <i>it</i> unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell it unto the Church</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>). This is the third step to take. Our Lord is contemplating a visible society, possessed of certain powers of discipline and correction, such as we find in the history of the apostolic Church (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 6:1, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>). Christ had already spoken of his Ecclesia in his commendation of Peter's great confession (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>); so the twelve were prepared for this use of the word, and would not confound the body here signified with the Jewish synagogue. To the latter the expressions in vers. 18-20 could not apply. The custom and order of procedure in the synagogue would afford an idea of what the Lord meant; but the congregation intended was to be composed of Christians. the followers of Christ, who were delivered from the narrowness of rabbinical rules and definitions. The institution of ecclesiastical tribunals has been referred to this passage, but, as understood by the apostles, it would denote, not so much ecclesiastical rulers as the particular congregation to which the delinquent belonged; and the offence for which he is denounced is some private scandal or quarrel. The course of proceeding enjoined would be impracticable in a large and widely extended community, and could not be applied under our present circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">If he neglect to hear the Church</span>. Now comes the final stage in corrective discipline. <span class="cmt_word">An heathen man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the Gentile</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and a publican</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the publican</span>). The class, not the individual, is meant. If he turns a deaf ear to the authoritative reproof of the Church, let him be regarded no longer as a brother, but as a heathen and an outcast. Christ, without endorsing the Jews' treatment of Gentiles and publicans, acknowledges the fact, and uses it as an illustration. The obdurate offender must be deprived of Church membership, and treated as those without the Jewish pale were commonly treated. The traditional law enjoined that a Hebrew might not associate, eat, or travel with a heathen, and that if any Jew took the office of <span class="accented">publicans</span>, he was to be virtually excommunicated. In later times, there naturally arose in the Christian Church the punishment of offenders by means of exclusion from holy communion, and excommunication. But even in this extreme case charity will not regard the sinner as hopelessly lost; it will seek his salvation by prayer and entreaty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The following words are addressed, not, as the preceding verse, to the offended Christian, but to the apostles, as possessed of some superior powers above those of any individual congregation. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> The Lord solemnly confers the grant made to Peter (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>) on the whole apostolate. The binding and loosing, in a restricted sense, and in logical connection with what precedes, refer to the confirmation and authorization of the sentence of the Ecclesia, which is not valid, so to speak, in the heavenly court till endorsed by Christ's  representatives - the apostles. Whether the verdict was the excommunication of the offender ("bind") or his pardon and restoration ("loose"), the ratification of the apostles was required, and would be made good in heaven. The treatment of the incestuous Christian by St. Paul is a practical comment on this passage. The congregation decides on the man's guilt, but St. Paul "binds" him, retains his sins, and delivers him to Satan (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>); and when on his repentance he is forgiven, it is the apostle who "looses" him, acting as the representative of Christ (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-10.htm">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>). In a general sense, the judicial and disciplinary powers of the Christian priesthood have been founded on this passage, which from early times has been used in the service of ordination. Each body of Christians has its own way of interpreting the promise. While some opine that, speaking in Christ's name and with his authority, the priest can pronounce or withhold pardon; others believe that external discipline is all that is intended; others again think that the terms are satisfied by the ministration of the Word and sacraments, as a physician gives health by prescribing remedies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a></div><div class="verse">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again I say unto you.</span> The following paragraph has been thought by many to be addressed especially to the apostles in confirmation of the powers conferred on them above; but from ver. 20 we should judge the promise to be general. Herein is set forth the privilege of united prayer. God confirms the sentence of his authorized ambassadors; he gives special heed to the joint intercessions of all Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Two of you.</span> Two of my followers, even the smallest number that could form an association. <span class="cmt_word">Shall agree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). Be in complete accord, like the notes of a perfect strain of music. Here one man's infirmity is upheld by another's strength; one man's short-sightedness compensated by another's wider view; this man's little faith overpowered by that man's firm confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Anything</span>. Of course, this is to be understood with some restriction. The thing asked must be reasonable, good in itself, expedient for the petitioner; the prayer must be earnest, faithful, persevering. If such conditions are satisfied, the desire will be granted in some form, though, perhaps, not in the way or at the time expected. Thus the Lord sanctions guilds or bodies of Christians united together to offer up supplications for special objects or with some definite intention in which all ere agreed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a></div><div class="verse">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The promise is applied to the public prayer of the congregation, as we see in what is called "the prayer of St. Chrysostom" in the English Prayer book. <span class="cmt_word">Are gathered together.</span> For the purpose of worship.

This would imply decent and orderly meeting for the highest ends. <span class="cmt_word">There am I in the midst of them.</span> Christ promises a real, actual presence, though invisible, as true as when he appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, as true as when the Shechinah shone in tabernacle or temple. The rabbis had a saying that if two sat at table and conversed about the Law of God, the Shechinah rested upon them. The promise in the text, of course, implies Christ's omnipresence and omniscience. This is his blessing on united, congregational prayer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-35.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">pardon of injuries, and the parable of the unmerciful servant</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - Peter was greatly struck with what Christ had just said about reconciliation of enemies; and he wanted to know what limits were to be imposed on his generosity, especially, it might be, if the offender made no reparation for his offence, and acknowledged not his wrong doing. <span class="cmt_word">My brother.</span> As ver. 15, fellow disciple, neighbour. <span class="cmt_word">Till seven times?</span> Peter doubtless thought that he was unusually liberal and generous in proposing such a measure of forgiveness. Seven is the number of completeness and plurality, and our Lord had used it in giving his sentence about forgiveness: "If he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn to thee again," etc. (<a href="../../par/luke/17-4.htm">Luke 17:4</a>). Some rabbis had fixed this limit from an erroneous interpretation of <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>. "For three transgressions, and for four," etc.; but the usual precept enjoined forgiveness of three offences only, drawing the line here, and having no pity for a fourth offence. Ben-Sira bids a man admonish an offending neighbour twice, but is silent as to any further forgiveness (Ecclus. 19:13-17). The Jews were very fond of defining and limiting moral obligations, as if they could be accurately prescribed by number. Christ demolishes this attempt to define by law the measure of grace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say not unto thee.</span> Jesus gives the full weight of his authority to his precept, in distinction from Peter's suggestion and rabbinical glosses. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy times</span> <span class="cmt_word">seven.</span> No specific number, but practically unlimited. There is no measure to forgiveness; it must be practised whenever occasion arises. Some translate, "seventy-seven times," making an allusion to the retribution exacted from Lamech: "If Cain shall be  avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>). Christian forgiveness must be extended as far as old-world vengeance. Mercy rejoices against judgment. But the genius of the language supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. St. Paul has caught the spirit of his Master when he writes, "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). In the Mosaic dispensation there was some foreshadowing of the doctrine of forgiveness in the enactments which enjoined tender treatment of debtors, and in the terms of the jubilee law; but there were no rules concerning the pardon of personal injuries; the tendency of many prominent injunctions was to encourage retaliation. Herein is seen an important distinction between the Law and the gospel, the institutions antecedent to the death and atonement of Christ, and those subsequent thereto. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-35.</span> - <span class="accented">Christ illustrates his precept by the parable of the unmerciful servant, and the stern lesson which he himself enunciates at its close</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because such is the infinite nature of the pardon to be meted out to an offending brother. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven.</span> The rule observed in the government of Christ's kingdom with regard to forgiveness is represented by the procedure of a certain earthly king. The picture supposes some great Oriental potentate, with numerous viceroys or satraps, who have to render to him an account of revenues received. These are called <span class="cmt_word">servants</span> in the sense that, though they are high officials, they are the monarch's subordinates and dependents. Both Herodotus and Xenophon apply the term "slave" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) to the great officers of state. Immense sums of money would pass through their hands. This accounts for the enormous debt of the officer in the parable. Webster and Wilkinson compare the East India Company's collectors, who are high civil <span class="accented">servants</span> of the company, that is, now, of the government. If we regard the parable in a general light, as illustrating God's dealings with sinful man, we must see in the "taking account of his servants," not the judgment of the last day, but those many occasions when God makes a man turn his eyes inward and learn how he stands in the sight of his Lord. Such occasions are sickness, misfortune, great change of circumstances, a new year, reproach of conscience, however aroused, - these and such like incidents awaken a man to his true position, show him his delinquencies and misery.

Otherwise the phrase may refer merely to Oriental etiquette, according to which no one can cuter the royal presence without being formally allowed the interview, and ceremoniously introduced. <span class="cmt_word">Ten thousand talents.</span> It is uncertain what is here meant by a talent, whether of silver or gold, of Jewish, or Attic, or Syriac standard; and, of course, the amount intended is variously understood. We must refer to the Bible dictionaries for an explanation of the term "talent," merely remarking here that the highest estimate would give six millions of our pounds, and the lowest more than half that amount. This huge stun must represent the total revenues of a province, and the debtor must have been a high and much-trusted official. It is used by our Lord to signify the infinite debt the sinner owes to God. Thus in the Lord's Prayer we have, "Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a></div><div class="verse">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He had not to pay.</span> He was absolutely bankrupt, and had no means whatever of meeting the deficit. <span class="cmt_word">To be</span> <span class="cmt_word">sold.</span> The Jewish Law ordered such process in the case of an impecunious debtor (see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 41</a>; and the concrete case in <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-12.htm">Psalm 44:12</a>). But this law was mitigated by the enactment of the jubilee, which in the course of time restored the bondman to liberty. The instance in the parable appertains rather to Oriental depotism than to the proceedings under Mosaic legislation (see ver. 34, which is not in accordance with Jewish practice). The king, by this severity, may have desired to make the defaulter feel the weight of his debt, and to bring him to repentance, as we see that he was ready to accept the submission of the debtor, and to grant him forgiveness (St. Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">Payment to be made.</span> The verb is put impersonally. Of course, the sale of himself, wife, family, possessions, would not produce enough to satisfy the debt; but the command is to the effect that the proceeds should be taken on account of the debt. The parable; must not be pressed in all its details; a false impression is often produced by fixing spiritual or allegorical meaning upon the unimportant accessories, which, in fact, merely give vividness to the offered picture. The sale of wife and children is of this character, though it may be said generally and experimentally that a man's sins react on his family in some sort, lowering position and reputation, and reducing to poverty  etc.; but this result has no bearing on the lessening of the original debt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-26.htm">Matthew 18:26</a></div><div class="verse">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> Prostrated himself before the monarch, and in this abject attitude sued for mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Have patience with me.</span> Be long suffering in my case; give me time. <span class="cmt_word">And I will pay thee all.</span> In his terror and anguish, he promises impossible things; even the revenues of a province would not in any convenient time supply this deficiency. The scene is very true to life. To save himself from a present difficulty, a debtor will make any promise that occurs to him, without considering whether he will ever be in a position to fulfil it. The defaulter in the parable must have thought well of the king's generosity and tenderheartedness to make such a proposition at this extreme moment. If we take the spiritual sense of the parable, we see that no sinner could offer to pay, much less pay, the debt due from him to his Lord, "so that must be let alone forever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-27.htm">Matthew 18:27</a></div><div class="verse">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was moved with</span> <span class="cmt_word">compassion.</span> The earthly circumstance has its counterpart in God's dealings with sinners. Humility, confession, prayer, are accepted by him as payment of the debt. <span class="cmt_word">Loosed him</span> from arrest, from being sold as a slave. This was the first favour accorded. The second was even greater. <span class="cmt_word">Forgave him the debt.</span> The servant had asked only for time; he receives acquittance of the enormous sum which he owed. The king's severity had brought home to the debtor his full guilt did its consequences; when he realizes these, and throws himself on his lord's mercy, he receives more than he had asked or hoped for. But (to revert to the spiritual interpretation) the pardoned sinner must not forget the past; he must live as one forgiven. Says the penitent psalmist, "I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me" (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-28.htm">Matthew 18:28</a></div><div class="verse">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took <i>him</i> by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went out</span> - straightway from his lord's presence, where he had been so mercifully treated, while the remembrance of his free and undeserved forgiveness must have been still fresh. <span class="cmt_word">Found</span>.

Here, rather, was providentially offered an opportunity of showing that his lord's goodness was not thrown away, but had entered his heart and controlled his conduct towards others. <span class="cmt_word">One of his fellow servants.</span> An official of the king, but probably in an inferior position to that which he himself occupied. Seeing this man, he is reminded of a paltry debt which this person owed him. He remembers this fact; he forgets his late experience. <span class="cmt_word">An hundred pence</span> (<span class="accented">denarii</span>; see on Matthew 20:2); equivalent to some &pound;3 of our money, and a sum not a millionth part of his own debt to his master; the proportion, as some say, may be stated more accurately as 1 to 1,250,000. The enormous difference between these two amounts represents the disproportion between the offences of our neighbours against us and those of which we are guilty towards God; and how small is the forgiveness on our side compared with that which God freely accords to our infinite debt to him! We must consider also the parties to whom these debts are owing - on one side, the worm man; on the other, Almighty God. <span class="cmt_word">Took</span> him <span class="cmt_word">by the throat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">was throttling him</span>.

Many manuscripts and late editors (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf, Alford, Westcott and Hort) soften the demand by reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">si quid debes</span>, "if thou owest aught," as though the creditor were ashamed of mentioning the paltry sum due; or else it is simply a fashion of speaking, not to be pressed as if any doubt was intimated concerning the debt. It might almost be rendered, "Pay, since thou owest something." Not thus had his lord addressed him in the first instance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-29.htm">Matthew 18:29</a></div><div class="verse">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fell down at his</span> <span class="cmt_word">feet.</span> The fellow servant repeated the action and the very plea which he himself had but now used so successfully. <span class="cmt_word">Besought</span>.

"He did not even regard the words by which he himself had been saved (for on saying these same words he had been delivered from the ten thousand talents), nor recognize the port by which he had escaped shipwreck; neither did the attitude of supplication remind him of his master's kindness; but putting aside all such considerations by reason of covetousness, cruelty, and revenge, he was fiercer than any wild beast" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He went and cast him into prison.</span> He either himself dragged the wretched debtor to prison, or was not satisfied till he had seen the door of the gaol close upon him. Far from forgiving the debt, he would not even grant an extension of time; he must have payment immediately, or he will exact the utmost punishment till the debt is fully discharged. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-31.htm">Matthew 18:31</a></div><div class="verse">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fellow servants.</span> Those in the same condition of life as the incarcerated debtor. Mystically, they would be the angels, who, like those in the parable of the tares, tell the Lord what was done; or the saints who plead with God against oppression and injustice. <span class="cmt_word">They were very sorry.</span> It is well remarked that anger  against sin is God's attribute (ver. 34), sorrow appertains to men. These have a fellow feeling for the sinner, in that they are conscious that in their own heart there are germs of evil which, unchecked, may develop into similar wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Told</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">told clearly</span>. They took the part of their comrade, and, not in revenge or malice, but as an act of justice, gave their lord full information of what had happened. The just cannot hold their peace at the sight of oppression and wrong, and God confirms their judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-32.htm">Matthew 18:32</a></div><div class="verse">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After that he had called him.</span> A second time he is brought before his lord, not now to receive forgiveness, but to have the enormity of his guilt exhibited to him, and to suffer well deserved punishment. In a mystical sense this call is the summons of death, which is virtually judgment. <span class="cmt_word">O thou wicked servant.</span> The lord had not so addressed him when he had come cringing into his presence on the former occasion; he had spoken no words of reproach, but simply left him in the hands of justice. Now he calls him "wicked," because he is unmerciful; he deserves the epithet, because he has been guilty of a crime as heinous as theft or murder. Then the lord places in strong contrast the mercy which he had received and the unmercifulness which he had shown. <span class="cmt_word">All that debt.</span> Great as it was. <span class="cmt_word">Thou desiredst me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">besoughtest me</span>; calledst on me for aid.

The man's guilt lies in his unmercifulness in the face of mercy received. The fact is patent; it stands for itself; it needs no amplification or enforcement. The king says no more, and the delinquent is equally silent; he has no excuse to offer. Convicted by his own conscience, he knows it is useless to sue for pardon or to expect further leniency. So in the day of judgment no excuse can be admitted; it is too late to plead or argue when the sentence is past. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a></div><div class="verse">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was wroth.</span> This, as we said above, is the prerogative of God. Man is pained and grieved at sin; God is angry. <span class="cmt_word">Tormentors;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">tortoribus</span>. These are not the gaolers, prison keepers, but persons who put prisoners to the torture. Neither Jewish nor Roman law at that time recognized any such officials; neither were those in confinement treated thus in either community. The idea is taken from the practice of Oriental despotism, which might thus punish an offence considered supremely detestable. In a mystical sense these are the ministers of Divine vengeance who carry out the behests of the King. <span class="cmt_word">Till he should pay;</span> <span class="accented">until he should have paid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Some editors omit or bracket <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but the sense is the same with or without the relative. The debt never could be paid, so practically the punishment would last forever. Commentators, mediaeval and modern, see here an argument for the eternity of future punishment; others see in the clause an intimation that sin may be forgiven in the other world, though not repented of or pardoned in this present life. The words give no support to the latter interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Until</span>, etc., does not necessarily signify that the condition specified is certain to be fulfilled. As Bengel says, on <a href="../../par/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>, "Non sequitur ergo post." And in the present case there could be no possibility of payment. A criminal delivered to the tormentors would have no opportunity or means of raising the necessary funds. If this is a picture of the final judgment, it is parallel to our Lord's statement in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a>, "Thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing;" for, as the Preacher says, "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All that was due</span> [<span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>] (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Modern editors reject <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">universum debitum</span>. This is more general than "all that debt" in ver. 32. It is usually taken to refer to the old debt now redemanded. But a difficulty has been found in the fact that this old debt had been freely forgiven and utterly done away, and therefore could not, in equity, be again exacted. Hence some commentators have explained the clause as referring not at all to the former debt, but to a new debt incurred by a new offence, viz. ingratitude and unmercifulness. But the spiritual truth seems to be that, although sins once absolutely forgiven are not again imputed, they make subsequent sins more heinous, as in a human law court previous conviction increases the penalty of a fresh transgression. Falling from grace, a man passes into enmity with God, and so far cancels his pardon, and is in a state of condemnation (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24, 26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/18-35.htm">Matthew 18:35</a></div><div class="verse">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So likewise.</span> This points to the moral of the parable intended by Christ. It is not a lesson against ingratitude, but against unmercifulness. "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." But want of charity makes a man incapable of retaining God's pardon; the Holy Spirit cannot abide in an unforgiving soul. <span class="cmt_word">My heavenly Father.</span> He says, not "your" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14, 26</a>), nor "our," but "my heavenly Father," the Father of Christ, the God of all  mercies. He cannot join himself in mention with such as are not children of God. <span class="cmt_word">From your hearts.</span> Forgiveness must be real, sincere, not pretended, nor merely outward. There must not only be no outward act of revenge, but no malice in the heart, no storing up of evil passions for future outlet, as occasion may arise. The heart must be in harmony with the conduct, and both must evidence a true spirit of charity. This alone enables one to continue in a state of grace and in reconciliation with God; this alone makes prayer acceptable; and we are assured that, as our heavenly Father requires us to forgive without limit, so his mercy is infinite and will be extended to us in measure unbounded. <span class="cmt_word">Their trespasses.</span> These words are omitted by many manuscripts, the Vulgate, and most modern editors; and they are not required by the sense. They have been, perhaps, added to obviate a certain abruptness in the conclusion of the parable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/19.htm"><title>Matthew 19 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/19.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/19.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/19-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/18.htm" title="Matthew 18">&#9668;</a> Matthew 19 <a href="../matthew/20.htm" title="Matthew 20">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The beginning of the last journey to Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented">The question concerning divorce</span>.

But St. Matthew's narrative omits many events that happened in the interval between the account of the Galilaean ministry and the history of these last days, that is, from the autumn of one year to the spring of the next. The transactions of this time, which are omitted also by St. Mark, are given by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-17:11</a>) and St. John (<a href="../../par/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2-11:54</a>), comprising many things that occurred at Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles and on other occlusions. <span class="cmt_word">He departed from Galilee.</span> Not visiting it again till he appeared there after his resurrection.

Judaea was bounded by the river, and there was no part of it beyond, that is, on the east of Jordan. The words, "beyond Jordan," belong to the verb "came," and the clause signifies that the object of Christ's journey was the vicinity of Judaea, and that, instead of entering the province by the direct road through Samaria, he took the more lengthy but safer route through Peraea. This was the name of the region on the east of the Jordan (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">beyond</span>), extending at this time from the river Hieromax, or Jarmouk, on the north, to the Arnon on the south, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the middle of the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The ruler of this district was Herod Antipas, and it was at this era in a most flourishing condition, notably fertile, and containing many fine towns ornamented with magnificent buildings. Here the simple, pastoral country people were less influenced by the narrow bigotry of the Pharisaic party, and in the towns the ban which excluded Jesus from the synagogues of Galilee and Judaea was either not recognized or not enforced. A quiet opportunity for preaching the gospel was thus offered. This may possibly be the sojourn in Peraea mentioned by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40-42</a>).

The question proposed concerned divorce. <span class="cmt_word">To put away his wife forevery cause;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">quacumque ex causa</span>; <span class="accented">for any cause whatever</span>. This was a delicate question to raise in the domains of Herod Antipas (see <a href="../../par/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3, 4</a>), and one greatly debated in the rabbinical schools. Our Lord had already twice pronounced upon the subject, once in the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>), and again when reasoning with the Pharisees on the due observance of the Law (<a href="../../par/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>). Two opposite opinions were held by the followers of Hillel and Schammai, the heads of antagonistic schools. The school of Hillel contended that a man might divorce his wife for various causes quite unconnected with infringement of the marriage vow, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, because he had ceased to love her, or had seen some one whom he liked better, or even because she cooked his dinner badly. The school of Schammai was more strict, and permitted divorce only in case of fornication, adultery, or some offence against chastity. Between these contending parties the Pharisees desired to make our Lord give a decision, thinking that they had fixed him  in a dilemma. If he took the popular lax view, they could deride his claims as a Teacher of superior morality; if he upheld the stricter side, he would rouse the enmity of the majority, and possibly, like John the Baptist, involve himself in trouble with the licentious tetrarch. There was a chance also that the high tone which he had already taken might prove to be at variance with Mosaic enactments. The easiness with which divorce was obtained may be seen in Josephus, Who thus writes: "He who for any reason whatsoever (and many such causes happen to men) wishes to be separated from a wife who lives with him, must give it to her in writing that he will cohabit with her no longer, and by this means she shall have liberty to marry another man; but before this is done it is not permitted her to do so" ('Ant.,' 4:08, 23). Josephus himself repudiated his own wife because he was not pleased with her behaviour ('Vita,' &sect; 76). And Ben-Sira gives the curt injunction, "If she go not as thou wouldest have her (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), cut her off from thy flesh,...  and let her go" (Ecclus. 25:26).

All his auditors agreed in holding the legality of divorce, though they differed in their estimation of the causes that warranted separation. It was quite a new idea to find the propriety of divorce questioned, and to have their captious question met by an appeal to Scripture which they could not gainsay, and an enunciation of a high ideal of matrimony which their glosses and laxity had miserably perverted or obscured.

God made the first members of the human family a male and a female, not a male and females. The lower animals were created separately, male and female; "mankind was created in one person in Adam, and when there was found no help meet for Adam, no companion in body, soul, or spirit, fit for him, then God, instead of creating a wholly new thing, made Eve out of Adam" (Sadler). Two individuals of opposite sexes were thus formed for each other; one was the complement of the other, and the union was perfect and lasted, as long as life. There was in this original institution no room for polygamy, no room for divorce. It was a concrete example of the way in which God unites man and wife.

The Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch insert "the two," which is not in the present Hebrew text. Our Lord adopts the addition as conveying the correct sense. In marriage there is a moral and physical union, so that two persons become virtually one being. Originally, man contained woman in himself before she was separated from him; she was a corporeal unity with man; or, as others put it, man, as a race, was created male and female, the latter being implicitly contained in the former; the previous unity is thus asserted. In marriage this unity is acknowledged and continued. St. Paul quotes this text in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31</a>; and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a> uses it as an argument against fornication,

This follows from the quotation just given. Our Lord explains and confirms the original dictum by an assertion of his own and a general law. What God hath joined together. The institution of marriage is God's appointment. Christ says <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span>, <span class="accented">what</span>, neuter singular, not "those whom," plural and concrete, that he may make it clear that he is here speaking in the abstract, not specially of Adam and Eve. What he enunciates is true of all wedlock, not simply of the case of our first parents. <span class="cmt_word">Let not man put asunder.</span> Man does thus infringe the primitive rule when he divorces his with. Herein he opposes God and acts against nature. He and his wife are one; they can no more separate from one another than they can from themselves. If we regard our Lord's language in this passage without prejudice, and not reading into it modern notions, we must consider that he here decrees the indissolubility  of the marriage tie. His hearers plainly understood him so to speak, as we see from the objection which they urged.

They are referring to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1, 2</a>. Jesus had escaped the trap which was laid for him, and foiled them by the very words of Scripture and the plain intention of the first institution. But they see their way to opposing the authority of the great lawgiver to the dictum and interpretation of this new Teacher. It cannot be supposed, they argue, that Moses would enjoin a practice condemned by the Word of God; therefore, if you abide by your exposition, you contradict Moses. <span class="cmt_word">A writing of divorcement.</span> The man who desired to divorce his wife could not effect this separation by mere word of mouth or by violent ejectment; he must have a written document formally prepared and witnessed, necessitating certain delay and publicity. In regulating the method of divorce and giving rules which prevented it from being undertaken rashly and lightly, Moses could not justly be said to have <span class="accented">commanded</span> it. There were also two cases in which he absolutely forbade divorce (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28, 29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a></div><div class="verse">He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses because of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">with a view to</span>, to meet) <span class="cmt_word">the hardness of your hearts;</span> your obstinacy, perverseness. You were not honest and pure enough to obey the primitive law. There was danger that you would ill treat your wives in order to get rid of them, or even murder them. The lesser evil was regular divorce. But the enactment is really a shame and reproach to you, and was occasioned by grave defects in your character and conduct. And it is not true to say that Moses <span class="accented">commanded</span>; he only <span class="cmt_word">suffered you to put away your wives.</span> This was a temporary permission to meet your then circumstances. Divorce had been practised commonly and long; it was traditional; it was seen among all other Oriental peoples. Moses could not hope at once to eradicate the inveterate evil; he could only modify, mitigate, and regulate its practice. The rules which he introduced were intended, not to facilitate divorce, but to lead men better to realize the proper idea of marriage. And Christ was introducing a better law, a higher morality, for which Mosaic legislation paved the way (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning.</span> The original institution of marriage contained no idea of divorce; it was no mere civil contract, made by man and dissoluble by man, but a union of God's own formation, with which no human power could interfere.

The first instance of polygamy occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-19.htm">Genesis 4:19</a>, and is connected with murder and revenge.

This is the received reading. Tregelles, Tischendort; Westcott and Hort omit <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>. The parallel passage in St. Mark (where Christ is stated to have made the remark to his disciples "in the house") omits the clause altogether. Lachmann, following some few manuscripts, has introduced <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "saving for the cause of fornication," from <a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>. The interpretation of this verse has given occasion to acute controversy. There are some questions that have to be considered in expounding this matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is here meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>? Does it bear its usual meaning, or is it equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "adultery"? These who affirm that the sin of married persons is never expressed by the word <span class="accented">porneia</span>, hold that it here signifies ante-nuptial unchastity, which would make the marriage void <span class="accented">ab initio</span>; post-nuptial transgression would be punished by death, not by divorce. In this view, our Lord would say that no divorce is allowable except where the wife is proved to have been unchaste before marriage. In such a case, the union being void from the first, the man is free to marry again. But there are difficulties in this interpretation. Why, at the end of the verse, is it called adultery to marry the divorced woman, if she was never really and lawfully married? Again, it is not correct to say that <span class="accented">porneia</span> denotes solely the sin of unmarried people. All illicit connection is described by this term, and it cannot be limited to one particular kind of transgression. In Ecclus. 23:23 it is used expressly of the sin of an adulteress. We may also remark that metaphorically idolatry is often called by this name, whereas, since Israel is supposed to be married to the Lord, the breaking of this bend by the worship of false gods might more strictly be named adultery. And yet again, there is no proof that the discovery of previous immorality in a wife did <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> vitiate the marriage (see <a href="../../par/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, etc.). The passages that are thought to bear on this matter are <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a> and Deuteronomy 24:1-4. In the former there is no question of divorce, - the offender is to be stoned; in the second passage the ground of divorce is "some uncleanness," or some unseemly thing, whether immorality or  personal defect is meant cannot be decided, the rival schools taking different sides. But it is quite certain that adultery is not intended, and ante-nuptial unchastity is not even hinted. The interpretation, therefore, given above cannot be maintained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Omitting for the moment the limiting clause, may we say that the general teaching of Christ makes for the indissolubility of the marriage bond? The majority of the Fathers from Hermas and Justin Martyr downwards affirm this. Those who admit that divorce is permissible in the case of the wife's adultery are unanimous in asserting that, by Christ's ordinance, remarriage is prohibited to the husband during the culprit's life; so that, practically, if divorce <span class="accented">a mensa et toro</span> is allowed, divorce <span class="accented">a vinculo is</span> refused. All Christ's utterances on the subject, saving the apparently restrictive clause (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>) and here, absolutely and plainly forbid divorce, on the ground of law and nature. The words in <a href="../../par/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a> are given without any limitation whatever. St. Paul draws from such his conclusion of the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as may be seen in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>. There could never have been a doubt about this subject had it not been for the difficulty in interpreting the parenthetical clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Are we, then, to suppose that Christ, by those words, modifies his general statement, and allows absolute divorce in the case of a wife's misconduct? Such is the view taken by many theologians, and practically endorsed by the civil law of many countries. Neither the Roman nor the Anglican Churches support this laxity. Ecclesiastical and civil laws are here antagonistic. It is said that Christ allows the wronged party to marry again. If so, if the oneness of the parties is wholly destroyed by the sin of the woman, why is it not permitted to a man to marry a divorced woman? This cannot be called adultery unless she is still one flesh with her husband, although separated. We must argue from this that divorce in such a case does not destroy the <span class="accented">vinculum matrimonii</span>, the marriage bond. and if not under this circumstance, surely under no other; for any other ground must be always less serious than adultery. If the clause in question enunciated an exception to the absolute rule elsewhere given, Christ would seem to stultify himself, to give two opposite decisions, and to introduce uncertainty in a most important verdict. The principle on which he based his dictum would be overthrown, and his hearers might have accused him of inconsistency. The solution offered for this difficulty is this - that Christ is contemplating merely what we call judicial separation; he considers that no trivial cause justifies this, in fact, nothing but fornication, and that this modified divorce does not free the man so that he may marry again; he is bound by the Law as long as his wife lives. Our Lord seems to have introduced the exceptional clause in order to answer what were virtually two questions of the Pharisees, viz. whether it was lawful to "put away a wife for every cause," and whether, when a man had legally divorced his wife, he might marry again. To the former Christ replies that separation was allowable only in the case of fornication; in response to the second, he rules that even in that case remarriage was wholly barred. <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever marrieth her which is put away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, without the article); <span class="accented">her, when she is put away</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">a divorced woman</span>. The clause is wholly omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and some other manuscripts, and some modern editors, as Westcott and Hort. But it has very high authority in its favour. Alford renders, "her, when divorced," and restricts the application to a woman unlawfully divorced, not extending it to one separated for <span class="accented">porneia</span>. But the language is too indefinite to admit of this interpretation as certain (see <a href="../../par/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>, and the note on Matthew 5:32, where the popular view is expressed). The clause, pondered without regard to foregone conclusions, surely contains an argument for the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as we have said above. Marriage with a divorced wife can be rightly termed adultery only in consideration of the continuance of the vinculum. <span class="cmt_word">Doth commit adultery.</span> The binding nature of marriage does not depend on the will or the acts of the persons, but on its primal character and institution. By the repeal of the Mosaic relaxation and the restoration of marriage to its original principle, Christ not only enforces the high dignity of this ordinance, but obviates many opportunities of wickedness, such, for instance, as collusion between husband and wife with a view to obtain freedom for marriage with others.

Marriage without any possibility of essential release (for they see that this is Christ's law) seems to them a severe and unbearable connection. It were better never to marry  at all than to fetter one's self with such an inexorable obligation. Such a doctrine was entirely novel in that age, and most unpalatable; and even the apostles receive it with wonder and hesitation. They have not yet leaned that in Messiah's kingdom grace conquers natural inclination, and strengthens the weak will so that it rises superior to custom, prejudice, and the promptings of the flesh.

Neither is the second class: <span class="cmt_word">those which were made eunuchs of men.</span> Such were common enough in the harems and courts of Orientals. The cruel and infamous treatment which such persons underwent was practised against their will, and consequently their continence had no sort of merit. The third is the only class which of choice and for high reasons lived a celibate life: <span class="cmt_word">which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.</span> This is not to be understood of excision; for this would be a contravention of the order of nature and the good work of creation. Origen, who took the passage literally, and with his own hands mutilated himself, was justly condemned by the verdict of the Church. The verb is to be understood in a metaphorical sense of the mortification of the natural desires and impulses at the cost of much pain and trouble, the spirit conquering the flesh by the special grace of God. The motive of such self-denial is high and pure. It is practised "for the kingdom of heaven's sake," that is, to be free from distraction and the cares and dangers involved in a married life. St. Paul carries forward the Lord's teaching when he writes (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32, 33</a>), "He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 4</a>). The celibate life, deliberately embraced for religion's sake, is here approved by Christ, not to the disparagement of matrimony, but as a counsel which some are enabled to follow to their soul's great benefit. It may be added that the counsel applies also to married persons who sacrifice conjugal endearments for spiritual reasons - "have wives as though they had none" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let him receive it.</span> This is not an injunction, but a permission; it is no universal rule, prescribed to all or to the many; it is a special grace allowed to the few, and by few attained. "Each man," says St. Paul, "hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7, 26</a>). Some think the Essenes are here referred to; but it is not likely that our Lord would endorse the practices of a sect which in some of its tenets was by no means commendable. Rather he is laying down a limitation that, while self-sacrifice and self-dedication to God are acceptable and fraught with peculiar blessings, none should attempt to win heaven in this way, unless they are specially prepared for such a life by the grace of God mastering the human will and controlling every earthly desire. The pre-eminent value set on celibacy by the early Church was learned from this and similar passages; but Christ institutes no comparison between the single and married states; and it would have been wiser to imitate his reserve in estimating the spiritual merits of the two conditions.

This happened directly after the preceding conversation. Mothers were won to his side by his elevation of woman to her true position, and his marked tenderness to children. <span class="cmt_word">Little children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). St. Luke calls them <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, "their infants." These were babes whom the mothers carried in their arms, and who were too young to understand the meaning and importance of the act of Christ in blessing them. It was a custom to take infants to the synagogues, that they might receive the prayers and blessings of the rabbis, or holy men. For this reason they were brought to Christ as a holy and revered Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">That he should put his hands on them, and pray.</span> The laying on of hands was symbolical of blessing  (see <a href="../../par/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>). From the Jewish it passed into the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>), and continues unto this day to be used on various solemn occasions. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples rebuked them.</span> More definitely in St. Mark, "rebuked those that brought them." Why they did so is not quite obvious. Either they thought that it was beneath Christ's dignity, and a waste of his precious time to attend to these babes; or, being still of imperfect faith, they did not realize that any spiritual good could proceed from the imposition of Christ's hands upon unconscious and irresponsive infants. They had seen him cure bodily diseases with a touch, and they would have welcomed these little ones it' they had been brought to be healed of some obvious maladies; what they could not understand was that these irrational creatures, not possessed of faith, could be the recipients of Divine blessing. Christ, by word and action, teaches another lesson. St. Mark adds that Jesus was "much displeased" at the disciples' faithless interference. St. Luke tells us that he "called them [the babes] unto him," making his followers desist from their officious remonstrance, and said the memorable words which are given almost without variation by the three synoptists. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-14.htm">Matthew 19:14</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Suffer</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me</span>. He speaks as though the infants were ready and eager to come to him, if they were not prevented. He thus intimates the truth that, though incompetent to undo, stand God's blessing, children were not incompetent to receive it. There was no natural impediment to bar the way. Unconscious intents, under the Mosaic dispensation, were admitted to the privileges of the Jewish Church by the rite of circumcision; in Christ's kingdom analogous mercies were to be extended to them. From this passage has been derived a cogent argument for infant baptism, because Christ herein showed, not only that tender age and immaturity of reason put no obstacle in the way of his blessing, but that children were the standard by which fitness for his kingdom was to be tested. <span class="cmt_word">For of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> They who would enter Christ's kingdom must be pure, simple, obedient, as little children (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). That is why he says, "of such," not "of these," intimating that it is not to the age, but to the disposition and character, that he refers. Some, not so suitably, confine the saying to such as are dedicated to God in baptism. It is well said that what children now are is God's work; what they shall be hereafter is their own.

St. Mark tells us that "he took them up in his arms, put his bands upon them, and blessed them." Thus far he complied with the wishes of the parents who brought the babes to him. But we do not read that he prayed, as they had asked. Doubtless there was meaning in this omission. In conferring blessing he was acting in his Divine nature, and had no need of prayer. Sometimes, indeed, he prayed for the sake of bystanders (see <a href="../../par/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-30.htm">John 12:30</a>); here he prays not, that he may teach a lesson of his Divinity. <span class="cmt_word">Departed thence.</span> Set out from Peraea, journeying towards Jerusalem.

It took place probably on the next day after the blessing of the children. <span class="cmt_word">One came</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>). This is more emphatic than the enclitic <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and we learn from St. Luke that he was "a ruler," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of the synagogue, and he must have been of noted piety and worth to have arrived at this dignity while still a youth (ver. 22). St. Mark gives more details - he "came running, and kneeled to him." He was eager for an answer to his question, and recognized in Jesus a Rabbi worthy of all honour and veneration, though he saw in him nothing more. lie comes with no sinister intention, as the Pharisees did, but in all good faith, hoping to have a religious difficulty solved. <span class="cmt_word">Good Master.</span> Thus the received text in the three synoptists. The epithet "good" is omitted by many excellent manuscripts, and has been expunged by most modern editors. It is required if the received text of the next verse is retained. It occurs in Mark and Luke without variation. The young man may have used the expression with the view of winning Christ's favour, or, at any rate, with the idea of showing the light in which he regarded him. What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? His notion was that eternal happiness was obtained by the performance of certain acts, and he is not sure that he has done enough for the reward, and wishes to know particularly what further good work will secure it. The other synoptists have merely, "What shall I do? but of course, good work is implied, if not expressed. This was a question much mooted in the rabbinical schools, and one to which the answers were as various as they were puerile. Some taught that the commandments were not equally important, and that what they deemed the lesser might  be violated with impunity, if the others were observed. Some made the gift of perfection to depend on the daily recitation of certain prayers or psalms, others on giving due honour to the aged. Amid such perplexing rules, the youth desires an authoritative decision, which he may put in practice, and thus be sure of a happy place in Messiah's kingdom - be, as the Jews termed it, "a son of the age to come." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-17.htm">Matthew 19:17</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? <i>there is</i> none good but one, <i>that is</i>, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why callest thou me good?</span> Such is the reading of the received text here, and without any variation in the parallel passages of Mark and Luke. Our Lord takes the ruler to task for applying this epithet to him. unless the youth believed in his Divinity. You think of me only as a learned Teacher: how, then, can you speak of me in a term which can really be predicated of no child of man? Christ answers the ruler's address before he touches the subject of his interrogation, reproving him for using a form of words without realizing its full import. This is all plain enough; but many good manuscripts, including <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> B, D, etc., Vulgate, and other versions, read, <span class="accented">Why askest thou me concerning the good?</span> Most modern editors and the Revised Version have adopted this reading, which they hold to be genuine, and to have been altered subsequently in order to conform it to the other synoptists. If this is so, it is difficult to see whence Mark and Luke obtained their wording, unless - which is improbable - our Lord used both interrogations on the same occasion. The revised reading expresses Christ's astonishment at having this question asked; and it may be taken, as Bengel suggests, "He who is good ought to be interrogated about the good;" or, "What is right to do, you ought to know; it can only be obedience to the Author of all goodness." There is <span class="cmt_word">none good but one</span>, that is, <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. Here again the reading varies. The other synoptists agree with the received text of Matthew, except that Luke has <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Late editors, following <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, etc., have printed, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">one there is who is good</span>, or <span class="accented">one is the good</span>. God alone is the absolutely good; he alone can instruct you and put you certainly in the right way. Persons have been found to argue from this sentence that Christ renounces all claim to be God Almighty. But it is not so. He replies to what was in the young man's mind. The ruler regarded Jesus as man only; Jesus intimates that, in comparison with God, no man is good. He does not deny the applicability of the epithet to himself, but turns the questioner's thoughts to the Source of all good. He will not have himself regarded simply as a pre-eminently good man, but as Son of God, one with the Father. <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">willest to</span>) enter into life; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. enjoy eternal life. Christ uses a term equivalent to that of the ruler in ver. 16. So Christ said on another occasion to a lawyer who tempted him. "This do, and thou shalt live" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>). There is no real life without obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep the commandments</span> of him who is good. The Law was given to prepare men to receive Christianity, and in proportion as they carefully observed it, so were they made ready to inherit the life which Christ gives. No mere external compliance without faith is here approved, but it is laid down that, in order to win eternal life, there must be strict observance of God's laws - not some one extraordinary performance, but constant attention to known duties from the highest motive. Faith, indeed, is belief in action, and is dead and profitless if inoperative; so that true obedience is the outcome of true faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-18.htm">Matthew 19:18</a></div><div class="verse">He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">?</span> Christ's answer was disappointing to the inquirer; it was too vague and general to satisfy his thought. He expected to hear (as the rabbis taught) of some special precept or precepts, difficult of accomplishment, and not usually regarded, by observance of which he could obtain his great reward. So he asks with laudable persistence, "<span class="accented">Of what sort</span> are these commandments which I have to obey?" He is far from thinking of the common duties of the Decalogue, though doubtless he had been taught that these varied greatly in meritoriousness. Christ, in reply, notifies, as examples, the chief enactments of what we call the second table of the Decalogue, quoting the sixth, seventh,eighth, ninth, and fifth. He enunciates nothing uncommon, nothing new; and, by prefixing the definite article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> to the enumeration, he makes the whole a substantial unity, comprising the moral law of duty to one's neighbour. Perhaps Christ confines his list to the second table in order to make the man feel his imperfection in these ordinary matters, or to bring out his self-righteous spirit. There could be no doubt that infringement of the first table involved the loss of eternal life. Ver. 17 virtually includes the spirit of this table. It was round these last six commandments chiefly that rabbinical traditions and interpretations had gathered, so that their plain meaning was obscured or depraved. Whoever observed the second table in spirit and truth, kept also the first (<a href="../../par/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9, 10</a>); and it is easier to love one's neighbour than to love God, as the apostle witnesses (see <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>); and without love of our neighbour there cannot be true love of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a></div><div class="verse">Honour thy father and <i>thy</i> mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honour</span>, etc. Lange considers that in this verse we have a summary of the two tables, "Honour thy father and mother," summing up the commandments  of the first; and "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," those of the second (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> St. Mark and St. Luke omit this clause; the latter adds, "Defraud not." According to our text, Christ gives four negative and two positive commands: the last being a summary taken from <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a>). It has been questioned why our Lord omits the tenth commandment (as we call it) from the catalogue. Virtually he introduces it in ver. 21; but he may have refrained from formally mentioning it because covetousness was the ruler's besetting sin, and the marked omission of this precept might force the man to reflect upon this failing, which would wreck his spiritual life. On the other hand, it may be that Christ is not intending to give an epitome of man's duty; but affording merely an outline of the same, he naturally passes over some portion without special mention. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-20.htm">Matthew 19:20</a></div><div class="verse">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these things have I kept</span> [<span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">my youth</span> <span class="cmt_word">up</span>]. The bracketed words are omitted in some good manuscripts, and by most modern editors; but they have high authority, and are found in most versions, and in the parallel passages of Mark and Luke. They accurately express the ruler's view of his conduct. He could say without hesitation or mental reservation that he had scrupulously observed the duties of the Decalogue from the time that he knew right from wrong. Of course, we accuse one who could make such a statement of self-righteousness, of ignorance of the spirit of the Law which he claimed to have obeyed; and if one of us spoke thus presumptuously, we should rightly condemn him; we should say that outward service and legal notions of duty were of little worth, and could not secure eternal life. But our Lord treated the young man differently. He did not blame him as boastful and self-deceiving; he had no reproof for his seemingly presumptuous assertion; he recognized his simplicity, honesty, and sincerity, and St. Mark tells us that "Jesus beholding [looking upon, or into] him, loved him." He read the youth's heart, saw how pure and guileless it was, recognized in him the possibility of great things, and that he was worthy of the saintly life. The ruler felt that there was more to come; hence he asks, <span class="cmt_word">What lack I yet?</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span>; In what respect am I still deficient? How do I come short of eternal life? He had still a sense of want. All that he had done had not given him peace of mind. Hence his inquiry. From a Christian the question would savour of ignorance and unspirituality; but this man asked it in all sincerity, desiring earnestly to know what more was required of him, and being ready, as he thought, to undergo any pain, make any, even the most painful effort, if by so doing he might win the prize on which his soul was set. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go <i>and</i> sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come <i>and</i> follow me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">be perfect.</span> I believe what you tell me. You have led a religious life in the ordinary way; now yon aspire to higher things; you have a noble ambition to serve God more completely; yon have the power, if you have the will, to do so; I will tell you how. To be "perfect" is to be lacking in nothing that is required for life eternal. It is spoken of Noah and Job; it is required of Christ's disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). Christ is here giving a counsel of perfection, as it is called, not of obligation on all men, but suited to the idiosyncrasy of this particular inquirer, and of others who are capable of such absolute self-surrender and trustfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> and <span class="cmt_word">sell that thou hast.</span> Go back to thy home, and sell all thy substance, all thy possessions. This was the counsel which Jesus gave, denoting the stumbling block which lay in the way of the ruler's endeavours after perfection. He was voluntarily to deprive himself of the earthly thing to which he fondly clung, his wealth, and to embrace a life of poverty and hardship. <span class="cmt_word">Give to the poor.</span> The money obtained by the sale of his possessions he was to distribute, not to relations and friends, who might make some return, but to the poor, from whom he could expect no recompense. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt have treasure in heaven</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). Thou shalt obtain that which thou desirest, eternal life. Not that stripping one's self of goods and giving to the poor does necessarily ensure the great reward, but, in this youth's case, such a sacrifice, such a victory over the besetting sin, would be the turning point in his character, and enable him to conquer all lesser temptations, and win the prize of his high calling. Here was to be proved love of man. But there was one more element in the required perfection, viz. love of God. <span class="cmt_word">Come</span> and <span class="cmt_word">follow me</span>. St Mark adds, "take up the cross." If he would have apostolic perfection, he must embrace the apostolic life. He must give up wealth, position, earthly ties, earthly occupations, must cast in his lot with the despised Jesus, suffer with him, and, if necessary, die with him. The twelve apostles had accepted Christ's call on these terms; from him was demanded the same sacrifice the same test of sincerity. He had wished to be exceptionally good; exceptional conduct was required from him in order to reach this high standard. The condition imposed, severe as it undoubtedly was, exactly suited the case, showed the weak spot in the ruler's character, and, if  accepted fully and heartily, would have led him to perfection. Reading these words of our Lord, St. Anthony was so stricken in heart and conscience that he obeyed them literally, stripped himself of everything that he had, distributed to the needy, and went forth poor and naked, trusting to God to provide for him. Many in all ages, inspired by ardent love of life eternal, have done the same. We shall do well to recognize that there are two ways of serving God acceptably - there is the good life required from all religious Christians, and there is the life of perfection to which some, by God's special grace, are called, and which they embrace and fulfil. It was the latter life that Christ put before this young man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-22.htm">Matthew 19:22</a></div><div class="verse">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the young man heard that saying.</span> Such an injunction was wholly unexpected; it completely staggered him; it appealed to the one point in his character which was weak and imperfect. He would have endured any amount of legal requirements or of vexatious and painful observances; he would gladly have become a disciple of Christ; but the previous sacrifice was too great; he could not make it; not that he was specially covetous or avaricious, but his heart was set on his riches; he had a wealthy man's tastes and position and self-confidence, and he could not bring himself to cast away these even at Christ's word. Such supreme self-denial, such absolute devotion, he would not embrace. So <span class="cmt_word">he went away sorrowful</span>. He saw the right road, but he turned away from it. Without any further word, casting aside all hope of the saintly life, yet grieved and dejected at the thought of what he was losing, he returned to his home. It was hard to disobey the wise and loving Teacher who had endeavoured to lead him to the noblest aims and the highest ambition; but it was harder to follow his severe counsels. The evangelist gives the reason of this unhappy decision. <span class="cmt_word">For he had great</span> <span class="cmt_word">possessions;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>: <span class="accented">erat enim habens multas possessiones</span>; <span class="accented">he was one that had many possessions</span>, or <span class="accented">had and continued to have</span>, implying possession and retention (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/5-18.htm">Luke 5:18</a>, "he continued in retirement"). This fact was the snare that trapped him, the stumbling block over which he fell. The possession of riches proved fatal to saintliness. It is this truth that our Lord emphasizes in the following discourse. They who tare unconscious of having been tried as this young man was tried may condemn him as worldly, covetous, and insincere. A true Christian, who knows his own heart, may well feel that he can throw no stone at this defaulter; that he, any more than the Jew, could not give up all that he held dear for Christ's sake; that, bad the alternative been set before him in this blunt, palpable fashion, he too would have gone away sorrowful.

It was indeed difficult for a man wealthy, honoured, dignified, to strip himself of his riches and rank, and openly cast in his lot with the despised Jesus and his followers, voluntarily surrendering all that hitherto had made life beautiful and worth living. It is difficult for a rich man in any case to serve God acceptably, as Christ shows with reiterated emphasis.

A similar proverb is found in many countries, only substituting another great animal instead of the camel, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the elephant. From taking a too literal view of the passage, some commentators have invented a gate at Jerusalem, low and narrow, designed only for foot passengers, which was called "the needle's eye." Others have remedied the supposed absurdity by reading <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (if, indeed, there is such a word) "rope," for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as if we were to say <span class="accented">cable</span> instead of <span class="accented">camel</span>. But there is no difficulty in the expression. Such hyperboles and paradoxes are common in all languages (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-24.htm">Matthew 23:24</a>). The impossibility, indeed (as ver. 26 shows), is relative, but the warning is none the less real and terrible. The Lord says that the possession of riches prevents the owner from following him, and endangers his eternal salvation; for that is what it comes to. In St. Mark (whether the words are genuine or not is uncertain) we find a limitation introduced: "How hard it is for them that trust in riches!" Now, this is the effect of riches; men learn to trust in them, to deem that their earthly state is secure,  that change and chance will not affect them, that they are, so to speak, independent of Providence; they love the world which is so good to them and so pleasant in their eyes, and they have no earnest longing for a better home. Such is the natural consequence of the possession of wealth, and that which makes the impossibility of entrance into the kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-25.htm">Matthew 19:25</a></div><div class="verse">When his disciples heard <i>it</i>, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceedingly amazed.</span> The stern teaching of vers. 23 and 24 thoroughly dismayed and perhaps offended them. Temporal prosperity had in their Law been held forth as the reward of righteousness and obedience, a foretaste of future happiness. They must unlearn this principle. Here, as they understood it, was a doctrine novel, unheard of, unnatural! Fancy the astonishment that would be displayed nowadays if such a sentiment were solemnly propounded in the Stock Exchange, the bank, the market! The apostles could not minimize its import, or say that it might suit other days and other states of society, but was inapplicable to their age and nation. We can do this in the case of many seemingly stringent requirements of the gospel; but they accepted the announcement in its full and simple meaning, and asked in sorrowful wonder, <span class="cmt_word">Who then can be saved?</span> If the way to heaven is barred to the rich man, how shall the poor pass therein? The difficulty seemed to apply to everybody. All who are not rich are hoping and struggling to become rich, and therefore fall under the same category. If the apostles thought not of themselves in this question, they were grieved at the reflection that, under the circumstances, the majority of mankind were recklessly endangering their eternal salvation. With their views of a temporal kingdom, the apostles probably were thinking of their own prospects. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus beheld <i>them</i>, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus beheld them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">looking upon them</span>). He turned on his disciples a look full of earnestness, sympathy, and love, soothing their fears and claiming their full attention for a spiritual truth. <span class="cmt_word">With men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>this is impossible</span>. Men in their own strength, relying on their own natural powers, cannot save their souls or rise superior to the snare of riches. From the entanglements occasioned by wealth, and the lowering effects of its pursuit and enjoyment, the natural man is wholly unable to extricate himself. <span class="cmt_word">With God all things are possible.</span> Here is the only solution of the difficulty. With the grace of God, and embracing the calls of his providence, the rich man may be delivered from his dangers, may keep a heart unspotted, may use his wealth to God's glory and his own eternal good. So the impossibility is a conditional one, to be overcome by due recourse to the help of God and the strong hope of the future life. How a rich man may be disciplined and elevated we see in the case of Zacchaeus (<a href="../../par/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). Many such instances have occurred in our own days, as in all Christian times. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a></div><div class="verse">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Peter.</span> This was not so much a reply to any direct word of Jesus, as to the general purport of his late utterances. He had intimated that self-renunciation was the passport to eternal life; that a just reward awaited those who gave up all for Jesus' sake. This, Peter says, is exactly what the apostles had done. <span class="cmt_word">We have forsaken all, and followed thee.</span> It was not much that they had left, but it was all they had, their whole means of subsistence, old habits, old associations, to which the poor cling as tenaciously as the wealthy. All this, at a simple word of Christ, they had relinquished unreservedly, without regret or complaint. They had reduced themselves to the condition which Christ had enjoined. <span class="cmt_word">What shall we have therefore?</span> The question showed the usual ignorance of the nature of the kingdom of Messiah. Peter is thinking chiefly of temporal advancement and promotion, of success and dignity in an earthly realm. Even after their Master's crucifixion and resurrection they had asked, "Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). It was not till after the effusion of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost that their imperfect view was corrected, and they understood what Christ meant when he said, "My kingdom is not of this world." But what a revulsion of feeling must have taken place in those who a few minutes before had despairingly thought that salvation was unattainable, and now asked what their reward would be for the sacrifices which they had made! The older commentators have regarded Peter's inquiry as referring to eternal life after death, to which their acts had given them a claim. But it must be remembered that the Jews had very vague ideas about the beatified state in the other world, which, as many thought, was to be inaugurated at the close of the Messianic era, and which others put off indefinitely to the unknown day of judgment. It was never generally and popularly anything more than an uncertain hope, and was not regarded as a stimulant to life and action on earth. While, on the other hand, the terrestrial proceedings of the Messiah were a subject of the keenest expectation, and the ground of national aspirations. It is not probable that the apostles' notions had at this time risen superior to the popular view. Peter's question, therefore, was doubtless prompted by the national conception of Messiah's reign.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Christ does not reprove the apostle for his seemingly bold self-assertion, but, replying to Peter's question, he gives a grand promise to him and his fellow disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Ye which have followed me</span>, excluding all the half-hearted, the self-seeking, the Judaizers. <span class="cmt_word">In the regeneration</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>). The word means "new birth," or "renovation, renewal." It occurs in <a href="../../par/titus/3-15.htm">Titus 3:15</a> in reference to baptism," through the washing [laver] of regeneration." It has been variously interpreted in the present passage. Some have connected it with the participle preceding, "ye who have followed me in the regeneration," and explained it to mean the reformation and spiritual renovation commencing with the preaching of John the Baptist, and carried on by the ministry of Christ. But more generally and correctly it is taken with what follows, Ye shall sit, etc. The meaning, however, is still disputed. Some say that the Christian dispensation is intended, and an intimation is given of the work of the apostles in the unseen world in directing and guarding the Church. But this seems hardly to satisfy the language of the promise. Others regard the term as signifying the resurrection, when the mortal shall put on immortality, and we shall be changed, remade, reconstituted. This is true; but it seems more suitable to refer the term to the new creation, the new heaven and the new earth spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) and by St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 13</a>); This is the reparation of the whole creation described by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.), which is to take place at the great consummation, and which, remedying all the evils which sin has impressed on the material and spiritual world, on man and his habitation, may well be called new birth. This is the mysterious period when Christ's promise shall be accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit.</span> It is not "when he shall come," but when he shall have taken his seat (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with genitive) as Judge upon his glorious throne. <span class="cmt_word">Ye also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The pronoun is repeated to give greater emphasis to the amazing assertion. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with accusative); <span class="accented">shall be promoted to</span>, taken and placed upon. <span class="cmt_word">Twelve thrones.</span> Judas forfeited his position; Matthias and Paul and Barnabas were afterwards added to the apostolic band; so that the number <span class="accented">twelve</span> must not be pressed as defining and limiting. Rather it expresses the completeness of the judicial body, regarding not so much the persons as the position of its members. With reference to papal claims, it may be observed that Peter has no pre-eminence here, no throne to himself; he merely shares with his colleagues in the session. The apostles and those who have been proved to be of like mind with them (for the number is not limited) shall be assessors with Christ, as in an earthly court, where the judge or the prince sits in the centre, and on either side of him are posted his councillors and ministers. <span class="cmt_word">Judging</span>. So in Daniel we hear of thrones being placed, and judgment given to the saints (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9, 22</a>); "Know ye not," says St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3</a>), "that the saints shall judge the world...  that we shall judge angels?" (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>). Of course, the great Judge is Christ himself. What part his assessors shall take is not revealed. The verb "judge" sometimes signifies "govern or direct," and perhaps may be here used to denote that the saints shall, in the new Messianic kingdom, be Christ's vicegerents and exercise his authority. <span class="cmt_word">The twelve tribes of Israel.</span> There is considerable difficulty in interpreting this portion of the promise. If it means that the beatified apostles shall judge the actual descendants of Abraham, then we must believe that the distinction between Jew and Gentile will be maintained in this <span class="accented">regeneration</span> - an opinion which seems to be opposed to other texts of Scripture (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, etc.). The judging in this case would be condemnation of them for not receiving the gospel. One does not see how this can be held forth as a great and happy reward, however high a position it may imply. More probably <span class="accented">Israel</span> means the spiritual Israel, or the whole body of the Church; and the number twelve (as above) imports the complete number of those who are to be judged. They who have followed Christ devotedly and sincerely, as his disciples, shall be placed next to him in his glory, shall have pre-eminence over all others, and be associated with him in assigning their due portion to all believers, or in governing the Church. Nothing is here said about the final judgment of unbelievers and heathen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a></div><div class="verse">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one that hath forsaken.</span> The Lord extends the promise. Even those who have not risen to the utter self-sacrifice of apostles, who have not surrendered so much as they, shall have their reward, though nothing to be compared to the unspeakable recompense of the twelve. <span class="cmt_word">Houses...  lands.</span> Some manuscripts, followed by some modern editors, omit <span class="cmt_word">or wife,</span> the omission being probably first made by some critical scribe, who deemed that a wife should never be left. The Lord enumerates the persons and objects upon which men's hearts are most commonly and firmly fixed. He begins and ends the list with material possessions - houses and lands, and between them introduces in gradation the most cherished members of the family circle.  "Forsaking wife and children" may be understood as abstaining from marriage in order the better to serve God. <span class="cmt_word">For my Name's sake.</span> In consequence of belief in Christ, rather than do despite to his grace, or in order to confess and follow him more completely. In times of persecution, under many different cases of pressure, or where his friends were heathens or infidels, a Christian might feel himself constrained to relinquish the dearest ties, to east off all old associations, to put himself wholly in God's hands, freed from all worldly things; such a one should receive ample reward in the present life. <span class="cmt_word">An hundredfold</span>. Some read "manifold," as in <a href="../../par/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>. The spiritual relationship into which religion would introduce him largely compensates for the loss of earthly connections. He shall have brothers and sisters in the faith - hundreds who will show him the affection of father and mother, hundreds who will love him as well a s wife and children. And if he suffer temporal loss, this shall be made up by the charity of the Christian society, all whose resources are at his command, and he shall enjoy that peace and comfort of heart which no worldly possessions can give, and which are superior to all changes of fortune. And it may well be that the relief from the cares and distractions caused by wealth brings a hundredfold more real happiness than its possession ever supplied. "Godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Everlasting life.</span> The hope of future happiness is in itself sufficient to lighten and dissipate all earthly troubles, and to stimulate severest sacrifices.

This proverbial saying, which Christ uses more than once (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-30.htm">Luke 13:30</a>), is illustrated by the parable in the next chapter, and would be better placed at its commencement Here it conveys a warning that man's estimation is liable to error, and it must not be thought that those who are first in privilege are therefore highest in God's favour. The Lord may have had in view the case of Judas, who was an early apostle, and had the care of the bag, and fell by reason of covetousness; and that of one like St. Paul, who was called late, and yet laboured more abundantly than all that were before him. The application may be made with perfect truth to many professors of religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 18"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 20"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/1.htm"><title>Matthew 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../malachi/4.htm" title="Malachi 4">&#9668;</a> Matthew 1 <a href="../matthew/2.htm" title="Matthew 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The book of the generation</span>. As St. Matthew was writing only for Jews, and they, by reason of their Old Testament prophecies, looked for the Messiah to be born of a certain family, he begins his Gospel with a pedigree of Jesus. In this he mentions, by way of introduction, the two points to which his countrymen would have special regard - the descent of Jesus from David, the founder of the royal line, him in whose descendants the Ruler of Israel must necessarily (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>) be looked for; and also from Abraham, who was the head of the covenant nation, and to whom the promise had been given that in his seed all the nations of the earth should bless themselves (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). After this he proceeds to fill up the intervening steps in the genealogy. The spelling of the names in the Authorized Version accords with the Greek, and so varies from the Old Testament orthography; but for the sake of the English reader it is certainly advisable to do what has been done in the Revised Version, viz. to conform the spelling to that of the Old Testament, and, where the Greek varies much, to put that form in the margin. It is better to write <span class="accented">Rahab</span> than <span class="accented">Raehab</span>, and <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span> than <span class="accented">Salathiel.</span> Those who read the Greek Gospels when these were first written read also the Old Testament in Greek, and so were in no confusion. The first verse of the Gospel is doubtless intended as a preface to what is contained in vers. 2-17. It is, indeed, true that the phrase, "the book of the generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">sepher toledoth</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>.1), might <span class="accented">in itself</span> point rather to events and works connected with the active life of him whose name it precedes (cf. the use of <span class="accented">toledoth</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; even Genesis 2:4, <span class="accented">et al.</span>) , <span class="accented">a</span>nd thus might refer to the whole of ch. 1. (Kubel), or even the whole of the First Gospel (Keil); yet the addition of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of David, the Son of Abraham</span>, by summarizing the genealogy, limits the reference of ver. 1 to this alone. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) recurs in ver. 18; but being without <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, has a slightly different meaning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the word translated" generation" in ver. 17 is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, and means a single stratum of human life. The evangelist uses the name Jesus Christ here as a proper name, customary in later Christian circles (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>, and especially the traces of development from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a> to <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>). "Christ" is not used in its signification of "Messiah," or "Anointed," till ver. 17, where it would be better rendered "the Christ." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abraham begat Isaac</span>. From Abraham to David the genealogy in St. Matthew agrees with that in <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. In the other two sections, from Solomon to Zerubbabel, and from Zerubbabel to Christ, there is some difficulty in accounting for the variations, which are considerable. The natural descent of each son from his father is emphasized by the repetition of the word "begat" at every stage (cf., however, ver. 8, note) till we come to Jesus, and then the phrase is varied, "Joseph the husband of  Mary, of whom was born Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">Judas</span> ( <span class="accented">Judah</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">and his brethren</span>. The addition of these words seems very natural here, because the twelve sons of Jacob were the fathers of the tribes of Israel, and as descended from Abraham were heirs of the promises; and although Judah was the tribe from which the Messiah was to spring, he was to be the glory of the whole of Israel. The same words, "and his brethren," are, however, found in ver. 11, where there is no such reason to account for them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of Thamar</span> ( <span class="accented">Tamer</span>, Revised Version). In this genealogy the only women mentioned beside the Virgin Mary herself, who must of necessity be introduced, are Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba, and many explanations have been suggested why these should be specially singled out for notice. The most plausible reasons put forward have been that they are introduced because of the sins with which all but one of them were stained, and because two were not of the race of Israel. Thus, it has been thought, St. Matthew would, in the outset of his Gospel, proclaim Christ as the Friend, even the Kinsman, of sinners, and the Saviour offered to Gentiles as well as to Jews. It is probably wiser not to put so deep a meaning on the appearance of these names, but to consider that they are here because in each case the circumstances were different from the ordinary steps of the genealogy. Had they been in the same position as all the other wives and mothers who are unnamed, they also would have been left unnamed.

But it has occasioned some difficulty, because it makes but five steps from Nahshon, who (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>) was one of the heads of fathers' houses at the time of the Exodus, to the days of David. According to the chronology added in the margin of the Authorized Version, this period extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 1490</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 1056</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> more than four hundred and thirty years, thus making a generation to consist in each case of more than eighty years. And even according to the more accurate computation of the date of the Exodus ( <span class="date">B.C. 1304</span>) the period would be two hundred and forty-eight years, thus making each generation nearly fifty years. Even this seems very long, especially in the East; so that it is probable that the genealogy in Ruth, merely adopted by the evangelists, recorded only the more important names. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salmon begat Booz</span> ( <span class="accented">Boaz</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of Rachab</span> ( <span class="accented">Rahab</span>, Revised Version). That this was Rahab of Jericho has been generally received, and it is clear from the narrative in <a href="../../par/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>, where Rahab declares, "The Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath," that, whatever this woman's previous life and character may have been, she was then not unlikely to join herself to the Israelites. Moreover, her great services rendered to the spies, and the conspicuous way in which she and her house were singled out for preservation from all the rest of the city, may have marked her as not unfit to become the wife of a chief man in Israel. The Old Testament says nothing of this marriage, but there has been no endeavour made in the Bible to preserve every detail of the genealogies, the record of the successive fathers being all that for Jewish purposes was required. But that Rahab of Jericho was received among the people of Israel, not merely as one dwelling in their midst (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>), but to a place of honour among them, was an old tradition among the Jews; cf. T. B. Meg., 14 <span class="accented">b</span> ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebr.'), where Neriah, Baruch, Seraiah, Maaseiah, Jeremiah, Hilkiah, Hanameel, and Shallum, and also Huldah, are all said to have sprung from her. Some also say that she was made a proselyte, and was married to Joshua - a tradition followed, as it seems, in the Midrash 'Koh.,' on <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <i>that had been the wife</i> of Urias;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David the king</span>. The mention of David's royal position seems made here because at this point the line of the Messiah first becomes connected with the royal house. At the time when Saul was made king the people chose to have him in opposition to the Divine will; but giving them next as king a man after his own heart, God uses the offence of his people so that it shall become a channel of blessing, and from this king Christ himself shall be born. Of her that had been the wife of Urias. It is not easy to see why Bathsheba is spoken of thus indirectly, as her own name was certainly better known, and is more frequently mentioned in the Old Testament than Uriah's. The phrase seems to call attention most pointedly to David's sin. and that too in a sentence where his kingly dignity has just been markedly emphasized. The way in which God dealt with David and his sin is very parallel to that in which he dealt with the Israelites after their choice of Saul. David's first child, like the Israelites' first king, finds not God's blessing; but the second child is the pledge of peace with God (Solomon) - is Jedidiah, "the beloved of the Lord," as David the second king was the man after God's own heart. She that had been the wife of Uriah, after David's repentance becomes Solomon's  mother. Up to this point the genealogies in St. Matthew and St. Luke have entirely accorded, but with the mention of Solomon we come upon a variation, which continues till the union of the two forms of the pedigree in Salathiel ( <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span>, Revised Ver-zion), the father of Zerubbabel. In St. Matthew the line which is followed is the succession of the kings of Judah from Solomon to Jehoiachin ( <span class="accented">Jechonias</span>) . St. Luke mentions, after David, his son Nathan (of whom we find a notice in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>), and then passes on through a series of nineteen names, none of which is found in other parts of Scripture as belonging to the race of David. We have nothing, therefore, with which to compare them; but in number they correspond very nearly with the known descendants in the line of Solo,non, so that, although we cannot verify the names, the list bears upon its face the appearance of being derived from some duly kept record of the pedigree of Nathan, the son of David.

Between Joram and Uzziah the pedigree omits three names - Ahaziah immediately succeeded Joram (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>), and was followed by his son Joash (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>), and he by his son Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1</a>). These were probably left out, that the number of generations might be reduced to <span class="accented">fourteen.</span> It is not likely that St. Matthew omitted them, but that they were absent from the form which he used. If we seek for a reason why these precise names are omitted, we may probably find it in the fact of their being descended from Jezebel; while the language of the second commandment would suggest that to the fourth generation the children' of that race would suffer for the sins of their parents. To the Jewish compiler of this genealogy no argument more forcible for the removal of these names could have been suggested. It will be seen that the word "begat" in these verses does not signify always the direct succession of son to father.

Here we come upon another omission. Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim, and he the father of Jechoniah (called also Jehoiachin); see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>. The omission is supplied in some few manuscripts; but it may be only the case of a marginal note in a previous copy having found its way into the text. There is, however, something to be said in favour of its acceptance. The similarity between the names Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin is very great, especially in some of the Greek forms, so that they might easily be confused, and thus a verse be omitted in some very early text. Then Jehoiachin (Jechonias) apparently had no brethren (but see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a>), whereas Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, had two or three (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>). To make the whole pedigree agree with the Old Testament records some addition in this form would appear necessary; <span class="accented">Josiah begat</span> [<span class="accented">Jehoiakim and his brethren</span>, <span class="accented">and Jehoiakim begat</span>] <span class="accented">Jechoniah about the time</span>, etc. But manuscript evidence for this is extremely slight ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.,' i,). Yet the supposition that the name of Jehoiakim has been omitted removes what has seemed to many another difficulty. As the list now stands, to make up the fourteen in the third as well as in the second section of the genealogy it is necessary to count Jehoiachin - a king whose reign lasted only three mouths (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>) - twice over. He closes the second fourteen and begins the third. There is nothing like this found at the other division. To substitute Jehoiakim after Josiah would avoid this repetition of the name of such a very insignificant person, especially as the reign of Jehoiakim lasted eleven years (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). And to mention Jehoiakim as the father of Jehoiachin "at the time of the carrying away to Babylon" would be very appropriate, whereas to say Josiah begat his children at that date is not so strictly correct. It seems, then, probable that we have here some clerical error, which may have existed already in the list which St. Matthew used. About the time. The preposition in the Greek means rather, "<span class="accented">at</span> the time." The Authorized Version, however, gives the sense, for the birth of Jehoiachin must have been some years before the commencement of the Babylonish conquest, which may be said to have begun with Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of the land in Jehoiakim's days (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jechonias begat Salathiel</span> ( <span class="accented">Sheal-tiel</span>, Revised Version). From <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a> it has sometimes been thought that Jechoniah died childless, though the preceding context, which speaks of him and his seed, seems hardly to warrant the supposition; but clearly the words of the prophet there imply that none of his descendants should attain to a position such as was held by Zerubbabel, and that his family should soon come to an end. If we look at the genealogy in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> we find Assir mentioned as the son of Jechoniah (cf., however, Revised Version, "Jeconiah <span class="accented">the captive"</span>), and Salathiel as his son; and in the next verse Pedaiah, a brother of Salathiel, is named as father of Zerubbabel. By St. Luke (Luke 3:27) Salathiel is called the son of Neri, and in <a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>; and <a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel.  These are all the details we have, and to decide on how they are related to each other is very difficult. We may, perhaps, be right in supposing that Pedaiah, the brother of Shealtiel, having died, his son Zerubbabel was adopted by Shealtiel. We must then suppose that, the royal line through Solomon having ended, and Jechoniah's only child, Assir (if he ever existed, <span class="accented">vide supra</span>) , having left no issue, the line of David is taken up through the family of the other son, Nathan, and that from him descended Neri, the father of Shealtiel, who takes the place of Jechoniah's issue, which has altogether failed.

Here the two lines of pedigree in St. Matthew and St. Luke seem tc separate, and not to converge again till we come to Matthan (or Matthat), the grandfather of Joseph, which name is common to both. The Bishop of Bath and Wells has shown some reason for supposing that <span class="accented">Rhesa</span>, mentioned in St. Luke as Zerubbabel's son, is merely a title signifying "a chief," and also for identifying Hananiah, who is called a son of Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a>), with Joanna, who follows Rhesa in St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>), and there being some relation between the Juda of St. Luke and the Abiud (i.e. father of Juda) given as Zerubbabel's son in St. Matthew. Except in these few particulars, the two lines show no connexion of names, and it seems likely that the family of David had fallen into low estate for several generations before the birth of Christ.

St. Luke makes Matthat (or Hatthan; the names are from the same root, and in some texts are identical), to be the son of Levi. This is probably the actual fact. St. Luke seems to have traced the genealogy from Zerubbabel through a younger, son, St. Matthew through an elder. But the elder line failing, Matthan, the son of Levi, of the younger branch, becomes heir to, and is called son or, Eleazar, of the senior line. As the promise of the Messiah was to the house of David, and this was known to every Jew, we need not be surprised to find the families descended from that king preserving most careful records of every branch of the family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-16.htm">Matthew 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary</span>. St. Luke calls Joseph "the son of Heli." There are two ways in which these differing statements may be made to accord. The two sons of Matthan were Jacob the elder, and Heli the younger. It may be that Mary was the only child of Jacob, and Joseph the son of Heli. Then by marriage with his cousin, Joseph would become Jacob's son as well as Heli's. Or it may be that Jacob died without children, and Heli, marrying his widow according to the Jewish usage, became by her the father of Joseph, who hence would be called Jacob's son, that the elder brother's line might not die out. The points noticed above in respect of these varying pedigrees seem to be all those on which anything needs to be said with the view of comparing them. Their variety stands as a constant evidence of the independence of the two evangelists. Had either of them been conscious of the existence of the other's work. it is inconceivable that he would have made no effort to adjust the pedigree, for which he would possess means now lost for ever. They both design to give us the descent of Joseph from David, this being what a Sew would most regard. The descent of Mary from David is nowhere definitely mentioned in the Gospels, but that Jesus was sprung from David on the mother's side too we are warranted in concluding from the words of the angel to Mary (Luke 1:82), "his father David" (cf. also Delitzsch, 'Hess. Proph.,' &sect; 17). But though we ought not to spend vain labour in attempting to reconcile these two genealogies of Joseph, we can see, from what we know of Jewish customs, grounds enough for understanding how these variations came to exist. The same Jew, we find, was often known under two names; of this we have several examples in the lists of the twelve apostles. It is possible, therefore, that in these two pedigrees there may have been more points of union than we are able to detect. Then the rule, before alluded to, by which a man took the childless widow of his deceased brother for his wife and raised seed unto his brother, may also have led to much confusion of names, which we have now no means of unravelling. The evangelists drew each his own list from some authentic source, accessible to others beside themselves, and the record of which could be verified when the Gospels were set forth. This should satisfy us that those we have received were held by the Jews soon after Christ's time to be truthful records, and that each established from a Jewish point of view the descent of the putative father of Jesus from King David. <span class="cmt_word">Of whom was born Jesus</span>. This name, which, through <span class="accented">Jeshua</span>, is the Greek form <span class="accented">of Joshua</span> (for which, indeed, it stands in the Authorized Version of <a href="../../par/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>), signifies "Jehovah is help," and was not an uncommon name among the Jews, though given with marked significance at this time (see ver. 21). We find, according to the best texts, that in <a href="../../par/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> this name occurs in the pedigree of Joseph (where the Authorized Version has Jose), and the Revised Version has adopted that reading.

The evangelist here alludes merely to the well-known fact that Jesus was called by this name.

It was subsequently applied to Jesus both in the Greek form and in the Hebrew (<a href="../../par/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It must, however, be noticed ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Bishop Westcott, Add. Note on <a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>) that it was not a characteristic title of the promised Saviour in the Old Testament, and was not even specifically applied to him, unless, perhaps, in <a href="../../par/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25, 26</a> - a passage of which the interpretation is very doubtful.

As to (1), it may be argued that the evangelist himself, writing long after Pentecost, and recording sayings taught among Christians only alter Pentecost, would naturally wish his words to be understood in a Christian sense; and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here has at least that comparatively developed doctrine of the Personality of the Holy Ghost which we find indicated in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14-16</a>. It may, however, be justly replied that the words are in themselves rather a record of the feelings of Joseph and Mary about the Incarnation, and are merely a translation of the phrase <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> (or its Aramaic equivalent, <span class="accented">Ruah Kudsha</span>) , which they themselves used; and that hence its true meaning here must be rather sought in the meaning of the Semitic phrase in pre-Christian times. In other words, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here means neither more nor less than <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> meant on the lips of a godly and instructed Jew before the teaching of Christ, and especially before Pentecost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was this pre-Christian sense? What did R<span class="accented">uah-hakodesh</span> mean? To answer this fully would be to compile a treatise on one of the most difficult and disputed points of Old Testament and early Jewish theology. But a cursory comparison of passages in the Old Testament and the pre-Christian writings seems to show that, though there are many places which quite fall in with the Trinitarian view, and which are often marked by strong personification of the Spirit (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10-14</a>; cf. further App. A. in Dr. Sharpe's 'The Tree of Life,' Cambridge, 1889), religious Jews did not understand by <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> a permanent and distinct hypostasis in the Deity, but rather the Deity itself in relation to the world as the Source and Maintenance of its life (<a href="../../par/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; cf. Wisd. 1:7 Wisd. 12:1), in contrast to the Deity absolutely and as the object of worship. Pre-Christian thought, that is to say, used the term "Holy Spirit" as designating the One God in a certain relation to the world, not as designating a permanent and real distinction in the Godhead. If this be so, we must understand the phrase here to mean that Christ was conceived of God (not of any Person in the Godhead) in contrast to man. We may, perhaps, even give to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> its fullest meaning of" origin" (cf <a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The phrase as a whole thus only insists that the Child was by origin Divine. It will be noticed that <a href="../../par/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a> is then closely parallel, "the Holy Ghost" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) there apparently connoting an outpouring of life; "the power of the Most High" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), an outpouring of strength. Dorner ('System.,' 3:343; cf. 162, etc.) says that the expression in our text is "the less precise ancient Christian designation of the Divine Essence generally, out of which ( <span class="accented">de quo</span>) Christ has come. To the Holy Spirit in the Trinitarian sense is only to be ascribed, according to the Scriptures, first, the internal preparation of humanity for the Divine Incarnation, and, secondly, after the <span class="accented">Unio</span> the animation of the humanity of Christ by the Divine power issuing from the Logos." The passage in Martensen's 'Dogmatics,' &sect; 139, so well known for its latter part, apparently agrees with this: "He is born not of the will of a man, nor of the will of the flesh; but the holy will of the Creator took the place of the will of man and of the will of the flesh, - that is, the creating Spirit, who was in the beginning, fulfilled the function of the plastic principle. He was born of the Virgin Mary, the chosen woman in the chosen people. It was the task of Israel to provide, not, as has been often said, Christ himself, but the mother of the Lord; to develop the susceptibility for Christ to a point when it might be able to manifest itself as the pro-foundest unity of nature and spirit - a unity which found expression in the pure virgin. In her the pious aspirations of Israel and of mankind, their faith in the promises, are centred; she is the purest point in history and in nature, and she, therefore, becomes the appointed medium for the new creation." Observe that the Greek Creeds (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, Marcellus] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) , by not inserting the article (contrast afterwards <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) , probably intended only to reproduce St. Matthew's language. The Latin could not fail to be ambiguous (de <span class="accented">Spiritu Sancto</span>) . If, however, we divest ourselves of considerations directly derived from exegesis, and, turning to the theological side, ask which Person of the Blessed Trinity, in fact, prepared Mary for the Incarnation of the Second Person, we must undoubtedly answer that it was the Third Person. For this is his peculiar function, uniting alike the Persons in the Godhead and also the Godhead to creation (cf. Dorner, 'System.,' 1:425,437; 4:159, etc.).

Thus the promise meant to Ahaz and Isaiah that a woman, at that time a virgin, should bear a son, synchronous with whose childhood should be the Lord's deliverance of his people.

"It seems not unwise to suppose that God, who designed to send his Son to be the Deliverer of mankind, so ordered the course of the world in his Divine providence that many things should tell of the coming Saviour, so that when he appeared those who had studied God's revelation should tirol that the scheme of salvation had been one and the same throughout all time.

(Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The following parable is intended to illustrate the apophthegm at the end of the last chapter, which is repeated almost in the same words at the close, "Many that are first," etc., and "The last shall be first," etc. It taught the apostles a lesson in answer to Peter's question (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>), "What shall we have therefore?" and the primary lesson was that the reward of the kingdom is not of debt, but of grace. There are many difficulties in the parable, which may be better noticed after we have expounded its literal bearing and details. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven is like.</span> That is, what happens in the kingdom of heaven is parallel to the case of a householder, etc. The kingdom of heaven is the Church of Christ, whether militant on earth (when the labourers are hired) or triumphant in heaven (when the reward is bestowed). We may refer to <a href="../../par/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 45</a>, where an analogous comparison is found. <span class="cmt_word">Early in the morning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at the end of the last night watch (see on ver. 3), wishing to secure labourers, who at vintage time were probably in great request. <span class="cmt_word">Vineyard</span>. The Church is elsewhere so called by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28, 33</a>, etc.), and in the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had agreed with the labourers.</span> With those first hired he makes a special agreement for the pay of the day's work; with the others he acts differently. <span class="cmt_word">For a penny a day</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The denarius (always translated "a penny" in our version) was a silver coin about equal in value to the French franc, but of course in its buying capacities worth in those days a great deal more. We learn from Tacitus ('Annal.,' 1:17) that it was the usual pay of a Roman soldier. It was equivalent to the Greek drachma, which Tobit (5:14) offered to Azarias as daily wages. Our rendering of "a penny" conveys a very erroneous impression to unlearned hearers, both in this passage and in other places where it occurs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third hour.</span> It seems that at this time the Jews divided the day, reckoned between sunrise and sunset, into twelve equal parts, the length of these divisions varying according to the season. The day in Palestine at longest consisted of fourteen European hours twelve minutes, and at shortest of nine hours forty-eight minutes, so that the difference between the  longest and shortest division of the so called Jewish "hour" was twenty-two minutes. It is usual to consider the Hebrew day as lasting from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the sixth hour corresponding to our noon, the first hour being 7 o'clock and the third 9 a.m. This estimate, though not absolutely correct, is near enough to the fact to serve all expository purposes. The four periods mentioned in the parable are quarters of the working day, in which a proportional part of the day's wages might be earned. <span class="cmt_word">Standing idle in the marketplace.</span> The Greek agora, the Roman forum, and the Eastern marketplace, was the usual place where idlers and expectant labourers gathered together. Such a scene may often nowadays be witnessed in Oriental cities, and indeed at our own docks, and in many of our small country towns. It must be supposed that the labourers now hired either were not present when the householder first went forth, or that they had then rejected his offer, but now thought better of it. And so, in the case of the others later on. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-4.htm">Matthew 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also;</span> implying that he had already set some to work at fixed wages. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever is right</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); just and fair. He offers these no definite sum as remuneration, assuring them only that he will deal equitably with them; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. doubtless, according to their view, that he will give them three quarters of a day's wages, paying them <span class="accented">pro rata</span>. But at the end he treats them much more generously. Lightfoot notes that the Talmudists had tracts on the payment and regulation of labourers, and in their canons distinguished between being hired for a day and for some hours. <span class="cmt_word">They went their way,</span> quite satisfied to leave their remuneration to the householder, with whom probably they were acquainted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-5.htm">Matthew 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sixth and ninth hour.</span> At midday and 3 p.m., which would give respectively about half a day's and a quarter of a day's work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-6.htm">Matthew 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eleventh hour;</span> the hour before sunset, say about 5 p.m., leaving only one hour for work, when it would be most unusual to engage labourers. <span class="cmt_word">Idle</span>. The word is omitted in some manuscripts. There is some reproach in the master's question. Where were they earlier in the day, when he was hiring labourers for his vineyard? Why were they not in the marketplace, like their comrades, looking out for employment? Such questions, like many, others in the parable, are left unanswered. We see from the universal use of the term, "the eleventh hour," to express the close of the day of grace, how widely has prevailed the interpretation of the parable which applies it to the various stages of the life of the individual. (See on this below.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-7.htm">Matthew 20:7</a></div><div class="verse">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <i>that</i> shall ye receive.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man hath hired us.</span> A poor excuse, because, had they been at their post earlier, work would have been offered them. <span class="cmt_word">Go ye also into the vineyard.</span> The householder accepts the excuse, and, now that they are desiring to labour, engages them as the others, promising to give them what is fair. Their present willingness seems to compensate for their previous tardiness. The clause, "whatsoever is right," etc., is omitted by some good manuscripts, the Vulgate, and other versions. Thus no mention of reward is made to these - they were satisfied by being employed at all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-8.htm">Matthew 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <i>their</i> hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When even was come.</span> According to Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>), a hired labourer was to be paid his wages at sunset, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at the twelfth hour. <span class="cmt_word">Steward</span>. The lord himself is said to have hired the labourers, but he commits the payment of them to his steward, as his representative, to whom such matters of detail were entrusted. <span class="cmt_word">From the last.</span> Those last hired were first to receive their <span class="cmt_word">hire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), that which it had been agreed to pay them, in one case "a penny," in the others "that which was just." Why the last are rewarded first is one of the difficulties of the parable. To say that this is done because in their one hour's work they did more than all the rest, is a solution which is supported by nothing in the story itself. It should, in the primary interpretation, rather be conceived as depending on the lord's good pleasure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-9.htm">Matthew 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when they came that <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They received every man a penny.</span> The steward, of course, was acting according to his master's instructions (though nothing is said of any previous orders on the subject) when he thus bounteously remunerated those that had been hired at the eleventh hour. Some commentators have endeavoured to show that the "penny" allotted to each set differed greatly in value; but this is an unwarrantable conjecture, and it is indispensable to the purport of the parable that the wages should be alike to all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-10.htm">Matthew 20:10</a></div><div class="verse">But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They supposed that they should have received more.</span> The text varies between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">plus</span>, Vulgate) and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, the former implying "a greater sum" than the stated hire, the latter hinting indefinitely at "more" things, more in number. Seeing the liberal payment given to the others, they expected some increase in the wages offered to themselves, or an additional remuneration of some kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-11.htm">Matthew 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had received <i>it</i>, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They murmured.</span> They complained aloud of the injustice to which, as they thought, they were subjected. This is one of those traits in the parable which,  whatever its spiritual meaning may be, is most natural and life like. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, These last have wrought <i>but</i> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These last have wrought but one hour</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">una hora fecerunt</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">have spent but one hour</span> (Revised Version).

They do not allow that they laboured - they "made" one hour nominally. <span class="cmt_word">Equal unto us.</span> Bengel notes, "Envy does not demand more for itself, but wishes that others should have less." Their complaint is that others who have worked less are not docked of their wages in due proportion. <span class="cmt_word">Burden and heat of the day;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">the burden of the day and the scorching heat</span> (Revised Version). The latter word is used for the hot dry wind which, blowing from the east, was fatal to vegetation and prejudicial to human comfort, if not to life. The remonstrance of these men may be compared with that of the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="../../par/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29, 30</a>). They how somewhat of the spirit of the apostles when they asked, "What shall we have therefore?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-13.htm">Matthew 20:13</a></div><div class="verse">But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered one of them.</span> The Lord condescended to show, not to all the labourers, but to one of them - the ringleader probably - the futility of the ground of his murmur. Christ often explains himself to his friends, while he refuses further elucidation to enemies and the hardened. <span class="cmt_word">Friend</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>). Not a term of affection, or special good will, but one of indifference, addressed to an inferior. It was the word used to Judas (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a>) when he came to betray his Lord, "Friend, wherefore art thou come?" <span class="cmt_word">I do thee no wrong.</span> The labourer had really nothing to complain of in strict justice; he had received the full amount of the stipulated wages. But he very naturally felt that he had not been fairly dealt with. He would say to himself, "If one hour's work, and that in the cool of the evening, is deemed worth a penny, surely a whole day's labour, in the full heat of the sun, ought to deserve a higher remuneration." The difficulty here must be felt by every one. Nor is the master's solution perfect; it would scarcely commend itself to the dissatisfied murmurer. And doubtless it is not intended to be complete.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a></div><div class="verse">So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the last,</span> etc. The parable concludes with the saying with which it began (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>), but with some inversion in the order of the words. There it was, "Many first shall be last; and last first;" here it is, <span class="cmt_word">The last shall be first, and the first last.</span> The circumstances of the parable necessitate this change. The last called were first paid, and were equal to the first in recompense; the first were behind the others in time of payment, and in the spirit with which they received their wages; they were also treated with <span class="accented">less</span> generosity than the others. <span class="cmt_word">For many</span> <span class="cmt_word">be called...chosen</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>). This clause is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and other manuscripts; but it has good authority, and is most probably genuine. It is added in explanation or justification of the preceding statement. From not seeing its applicability, and regarding it as opposing the intention of the parable, some transcribers and some editors have expunged it from the text. But it would seem that Christ takes occasion from the particular case in the parable to make a general statement, that not all who are called would receive reward; because many would not answer the call, or would nullify it by their conduct; not, as Theophylact says, that salvation is limited, but men's efforts to obtain it are feeble or negative. In other words, many outwardly members of the kingdom of God are unworthy of, and shall not share in, its spiritual blessings. <span class="cmt_word">Chosen.</span> Many, that is virtually all, are chosen; but there is an election within the election, and they only who are of this inner circle shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. <span class="accented">The interpretation of the parable</span>. - As in all parables, so here, we are to regard the general scope, and not lay too much stress on details, which often, while adding to the vividness of the picture, contribute nothing to its spiritual side. The explanation of this difficult parable has greatly exercised  the minds of commentators in all ages of the Church, and various have been the views with which its bearing has been regarded. We may, however, select two expositions which seem to embody most of the suggestions advanced, and are in themselves most reasonable. The first considers it as of individual application - the call of God coming to the soul at different ages of life. Thus the householder is God, the marketplace the world, the vineyard the visible Church, the labourers are men who have to do their work therein, the steward is Christ, who superintends and rewards the faithful workers. The hours of the day represent the various periods of men's life at which they hear and answer God's call to a closer walk with him, when, as modern theology terms it, they are converted. Some, at the first hour, from their very infancy, live a pure and holy life; some at the third hour, in early youth, begin to serve God effectually; others at midday, in full maturity; others at the ninth hour, when old age is creeping on them; and lastly others obey the call only at the eleventh hour, at the very approach of death. And all who have laboured at all, without regard to the length of service, receive the "penny," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not some indefinite temporal benefit, but eternal life, which in a general sense (without considering the difference of degrees which shall exist) is the same for all. The apparent unfairness of this recompense, if we take a merely human view of the transaction, is obvious. They who have lived a life of holiness, and they who have given to God only the dregs of their ill-spent days, receive the same salvation. The difficulty is removed in two ways. We may say that the capacity for receiving and enjoying the reward depends ca the recipient, and that what to one would be infinite bliss and satisfaction, to another would offer far inferior enjoyment. Or we may take refuge in the mysteriousness of God's arrangements, and hold that the considerations in accordance with which God apportions his rewards are known only to him, and are truly, and are intended to be, beyond human understanding. Further, if the hours represent the stages of human life at which Christians are called, surely, to make the parable concinnous, they ought to be the <span class="accented">same</span> persons who are invited on each occasion, not different ones. We should be told, not that the householder found <span class="accented">others</span> wanting work, and sent all thus found into the vineyard; but that some of those called at the various hours refused the work and scoffed at his offer, while others after a time accepted it, and at the approach of the night all the idle remnant consented to labour, thankful at last to win wages for little trouble. But the parable says nothing of all this, and would need much alteration to make it speak so. There is another difficulty which has to be met, if the above interpretation is adopted. How are we to explain the murmuring of the discontented labourers? There can be no envy and displeasure in heaven. It is not conceivable that any who have obtained the gift of eternal life should be dissatisfied with their reward or jealous of others. This is not a mere accessory which is outside the spirit of the story, and adds no item to its mystical signification; it is really the leading feature, and the householder's own interference and reproof are based entirely on this behaviour of the first called. If the "penny" signifies eternal life, and the labourers are all the called, there is no satisfactory explanation of this part of the parable. The murmur is heard after the reception of the reward, and is censured accordingly; these things could not be found in the Church triumphant; none can murmur there; if they did feel envy and discontent, they would not be worthy of a place in the kingdom. Therefore another interpretation must be advanced which will allow the proper importance to this detail of the parable. The only one that does this is that which gives a national, not simply an individual, bearing to the story. According to this exposition, it applies to the calling of the Jews and the Gentiles, though there are still particulars which do not entirely or without some violence suit the application. The "penny" which all receive is the favour of God, the privileges that crown and reward the members of his kingdom. God's ancient people were first called to work in his vineyard. The various hours of the day cannot be accurately explained. Many interpreters follow St. Gregory in defining the first hour as extending from Adam to Noah, the third from Noah to Abraham, the sixth from Abraham to Moses, the ninth from Moses to the coming of Christ, the eleventh from the coming of Christ to the end of the world. During all the day, up to the eleventh hour, the call was confined to the Jews and their progenitors; in the eleventh hour the Gentiles are called, and, accepting the call, receive the same privileges as the Jews. It is better to forego any attempt to interpret the various hours and the various sets of labourers definitely, except to observe that the first called, with whom a covenant was made, plainly represent the Jews, the people called under the covenant of works, who were to be rewarded according to their service; the other workers are not paid stipulated wages; they receive ("I will give") reward of free grace in accordance with God's inscrutable appointment. That the Jews murmured at the admission of the  Gentiles to the kingdom of God and the Father's favour, we are taught in many places. The discontent of the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son is a case in point. So in <a href="../../par/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45, 46</a>, the Jews are filled with envy that the Word should be spoken to and accepted by heathens, and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>) complains that the Jews forbade him and his fellow apostles "to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved." Our Lord looks forward to and prepares his disciples for this envious and ungenerous behaviour, as he continually teaches that the gospel is for all men everywhere, confined to no people or country, but free as the air of heaven or the light of the all-fostering sun. These Gentiles are the last in time, but by their willing service and obedience in the faith are made first; while God's ancient people, once the first, become by their jealousy and hatred of others the last. "There (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God" (<a href="../../par/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28, 29</a>). This momentous change in the relation of the peculiar people to the rest of the world was thus foretold and prepared for. And the lesson ends with the mournful fact, read by the eye of the Omniscient, that though virtually all the Jews were called, yet but a small remnant will accept the gospel - the elect of grace, a little flock. By this parable, regarded in its primary application as a reply to Peter's question (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>), "What shall we have therefore?" the apostles are warned that they are not to expect as their due something supereminent over those called later than themselves; that the reward is not of merit, but of free grace. This last thought pervades the whole similitude, and must be borne carefully in mind, whether we take the individual, or the national, or any other mixed interpretation.

The fact of his death he had impressed upon his apostles, but the mode had. not been mentioned; such an unexpected, awful, and ignomiuious close was incredible. and needed special preparation ere it could be received as true. Intimations, indeed, of such a death had been given darkly, when his disciples were told that they must take up the cross and follow him, or when he spoke of being "lifted up" like the serpent in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>); but his words were not understood; they fell upon ears prejudiced to a certain erroneous conviction, which events alone could eradicate. <span class="cmt_word">He shall rise again</span> (see on Matthew 16:21). It seems to us almost incredible that, after all that Christ said here and elsewhere, his resurrection should have come upon his followers as a surprise which they could not believe without tangible proof.

As St. Luke says, "They understood none of these things; and this saying was hid  from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."

Some have thought that she was the sister of the Virgin Mary, so interpreting <a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. St. Mark makes the two apostles present their own request; and doubtless they put their mother forward, coming with her to the presence of Jesus, and using her agency in this somewhat delicate matter. Our evangelist was present on the occasion, and his precision may be relied on in this detail. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipping</span> him. Making the customary prostration before a superior. <span class="cmt_word">A certain thing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). She did not at first make any definite request, but endeavoured to get Jesus to promise to grant her what she asked. According to St. Mark, the sons say plainly, "We would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire." Thus Bathsheba addressed David. "I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-20.htm">1 Kings 2:20</a>). Salome is plainly intending to ask some great thing.

The petition was urged at this moment, because it was felt that a great crisis was at hand. This visit to Jerusalem must have momentous results; here Jesus was about to set up his throne; now was the moment to secure the highest places in his court. He had announced his death; he had also announced his glory; they balanced one declaration against the other, and seized on that which was most consonant to their national prejudices and their own ambitious views. Probably they interpreted the unintelligible resurrection to mean the establishment of the kingdom of Messiah (<a href="../../par/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>). If this was imminent, no time was to be lost in making their claims known. So thought the "sons of thunder," and acted with energy and haste.

They indeed merited a rebuke for their preposterous demand; but the Saviour deals mildly with them. They had spoken ignorantly, perhaps fancying that some favour might be shown to them on the ground of their relationship to the Virgin Mary, or because of their nearness to Jesus, and certainly not in the least realizing the nature of the kingdom, the qualifications of its inheritors, or the difficulties that have to be surmounted by those who would win eminent positions therein. Things that we deem most desirable would often be the very worst for our spiritual progress; and in praying for really good things, we are apt to forget to count the cost we must pay for their attainment. Jesus sets before the ambitious brethren the obstacles that would meet them. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye able to drink of the cup?</span> Joy and sorrow, blessing and affliction, in Holy Scripture are often denoted under the metaphor of a cup (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>).

The cup and the baptism adumbrate the two sacraments by which we are made one with Christ. Many of the best manuscripts, the Vulgate and other versions, omit this last clause, and the corresponding one in the following verse; and many modern editors, with the Revised Version, expunge it also. It is supposed to have been introduced from the parallel passage in St. Mark.

St. James first shared in Christ's baptism of blood, being murdered by Herod (<a href="../../par/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>). He was a martyr in will and deed. St. John did not, indeed, undergo a violent death, but he stood by the cross and felt his Master's sufferings; he lived a long life of persecution, banishment, and distress; he saw all his companions drop off one by one, till in extreme old age he was left solitary, with nothing to comfort him but the memory of vanished years, and the hope of an eternal future. Truly he was a martyr in will, if not in deed. The story that he was cast into a cauldron of boiling oil by Nero's command, and that, coming forth unhurt, he was afterwards banished to Patmos, is one which, except as regards the banishment, has not. been accepted by modern criticism. The event is mentioned by Tertullian ('De Praescript.,' 36.), Jerome ('Adv. Jovin.,' 1:26; and 'Comm. in Matthew' 20:27), and is commemorated in the Church Calendar on May 6, under the title of "S. Joh. ante Port. Lat.;" but it appears to have been a legend that first appeared in Tertullian's work, and was copied from him by other writers without examination. <span class="cmt_word">Is not mine to give,</span> <span class="cmt_word">but</span> it shall be given to them <span class="cmt_word">for whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">it is prepared</span>.

The Lord does not mean that he was not able to give it, if so he thought fit, or that the boon was solely at his Father's bestowal, not his (which he might have said, speaking in his human nature). What he affirms is this: The prize is awarded, not by favour or on any earthly considerations, but by absolute justice, and only to those who prove themselves worthy to receive it. Christ assigns to the Father the revelation of mysteries and the election to eternal life (see <a href="../../par/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>). <span class="accented">It is prepared</span>; <span class="accented">it hath been prepared</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>), according to certain impartial laws ordained by God, who is no respecter of persons.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a></div><div class="verse">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be so among you.</span> There is good authority for reading "is" instead of "shall be." The new order of things was already prepared. In Messiah's kingdom a contrary rule holds good. There the governors rule solely for the good of the flock, with no self-seeking, and serving no private interests. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever will be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">whosoever would fain become</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>great among you...  minister</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Taking for granted that there will be ranks and gradations of office in the Church, Christ lays down the rule that men become governors therein in order that they may serve their brethren, be the ministers of those who are subject to them. So the pope, in his official documents, with a verbally proper humility, terms himself, "Servus servorum Dei." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27</a></div><div class="verse">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever will be</span> (<span class="greek_word">qe/lh""... </span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">chief</span> (<span class="accented">first</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)...  <span class="cmt_word">servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondservant</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The characteristic of the Christian ruler should be humility. Christ enforces the teaching of the previous verse more emphatically by altering the terms in which it was stated. "Great" now becomes "first;" "minister," "slave." Of these two last words the former would imply rather occasional service, to meet some temporary call; the latter, the regular business of a slave bound to his master at all times. We do not gather from this passage that the Christian minister, called by God, is to take his doctrine from his congregation, or to be directed by them in his labours; but he is to devote time, talents, faculties, to the good of his flock, to spend and be spent in their  service, to let no private interests or pursuits interfere with his manifold duties to those whom he oversees. The same sentiment is found in <a href="../../par/matthew/23-11.htm">Matthew 23:11</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a></div><div class="verse">Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as.</span> Christ adduces his own example as a pattern of profound humility. <span class="cmt_word">To minister.</span> By his incarnation Christ assumed the lowliest life of man. He took upon himself the form of a servant, and was ever active in ministering to others' wants, going about doing good, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, casting out demons; always accessible, sympathetic, merciful; never weary of teaching, however fatigued in body; a servant to the race which he came to save. <span class="cmt_word">A ransom for many;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">instead of many</span>. The crowning example of his humility is that he gave his life as a ransom for the souls of men. This is the atonement, the sacrificial act, which (as the Mosaic sacrifices did in a partial and temporary manner) reconciled God and man. Whatever may be the way in which this atonement acts on the Divine mind, the expression here shows that it was vicarious and propitiatory, energizing, not by example, as an effort of superhuman self-denial, courage, and patience, but by an inherent power, as mysterious as it is efficacious. We can only say that, being the act of one who is God, its effects must necessarily be incomprehensible and infinite. The difficulties that beset this doctrine are increased by the fact that Jesus himself says little about the atoning nature of his sufferings and death - a topic which would not at this time have been properly received by friends or enemies, the former refusing to credit his approaching death, the latter being totally unable to conceive how such death could supersede Jewish sacrifices and reconcile the whole world to God (Sadler). Christ certainly died for all, as St. Paul says, "He gave himself a ransom for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), but all do not accept the offered salvation; hence arise the two expressions, "all" and "many," referring to the same object; "not," as an old Father says, "that salvation is limited, but men's efforts to obtain it are limited." The same expression was used by our Lord at the Last Supper, when he said, "This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>). A comparison of the passages in which the death of Christ is connected with the salvation of men would show a similar interchange of terms, depending on the view which the writer is taking of the doctrine, whether an objective one or a subjective. In the former case we may cite <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; in the latter, <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-29.htm">Matthew 20:29</a></div><div class="verse">And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-34.</span> - <span class="accented">Healing of two blind men at Jericho</span>. (<a href="../../par/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46-52</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35-43</a>.) The miracle narrated in this passage is common to the three synoptists, but with some remarkable differences, not one of them agreeing altogether in details. St. Matthew speaks of two blind men, St. Luke and St. Mark of one only, and the latter mentions this one by name as Bartimaeus. St. Matthew and St. Mark make the miracle performed as Jesus quitted Jericho; St. Luke assigns it to the approach to the city. Thus the number of the cured and the locality of the miracle are alike variously stated. It is an easy solution to say, with St. Augustine, Lightfoot, and Greswell, that two, or perhaps three, distinct facts are here related; and it is not absolutely impossible. though altogether improbable, that in the same locality, under identical circumstances, like sufferers made the same request, and received the same relief in the same manner. But we are not driven to this extravagant hypothesis; and the unity of the narrative can be preserved without doing violence to the language of the writers. As to the number of the blind men, we have seen the same discrepancy in the case of the demoniacs at Gadara solved by supposing that one of the two was the more remarkable and better known than the other. Hence, in this incident, the tradition followed by some of the synoptists preserved the memory of this one alone, who may have become known in the Christian community as a devoted follower of Jesus, the other passing into obscurity and being heard of no more. Another hypothesis is that a single blind man first addressed Christ as he entered Jericho, but was not cured at that time. Jesus passed that night in the city at the house of Zacchreus (<a href="../../par/luke/19-1.htm">Luke 19:1-10</a>); and on the morrow, when leaving Jericho, was again entreated by the blind man, who meantime had been joined by a companion, and healed them both. There are other solutions offered, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that there were two Jerichos - an old and a new town - and that one blind man was healed as they entered one city, and the other as they left the other; or that the term rendered "was come nigh" (<a href="../../par/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35</a>) might mean "was nigh," and might therefore apply to one who was leaving as well as to one entering the city. But we weary  ourselves in vain in seeking to harmonize every little detail in the Gospel narratives. No two, much less three, independent witnesses would give an identical account of an incident, especially one which reached some of them only by hearsay. Inspiration extends not to petty circumstances, and the credibility of the gospel depends not on the rectification of such minutiae. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jericho</span>. The Lord was on his way to Jerusalem to meet the death which he was willing to undergo, and to win the victory which he was by this path to accomplish. His route lay through Jericho, as the march of his forerunner Joshua had led. Joshua had set forth to conquer the promised land; Jesus sets forth to win his promised inheritance by the sword of the Spirit. "The upland pastures of Peraea were now behind them," says Dr. Geikie, speaking of the approach to Jericho ('The Life of Christ,' 2:384), "and the road led down to the sunken channel of the Jordan, and the 'divine district' of Jericho. This small but rich plain was the most luxuriant spot in Palestine. Sloping gently upwards from the level of the Dead Sea, 1350 feet under the Mediterranean, to the stern background of the hills of Quarantana, it had the climate of Lower Egypt, and displayed the vegetation of the tropics. Its fig trees were pre-eminently famous; it was unique in its growth of palms of various kinds: its crops of dates were a proverb; the balsam plant, which grew principally here, furnished a costly perfume, and was in great repute for healing wounds; maize yielded a double harvest; wheat ripened a whole month earlier than in Galilee, and innumerable bees found a paradise in the many aromatic flowers and plants, not a few unknown elsewhere, which filled the air with odours and the landscape with beauty. Rising like an amphitheatre from amidst this luxuriant scene, lay Jericho, the chief place east of Jerusalem, at seven or eight miles distant from the Jordan, on swelling slopes, seven hundred feet above the bed of the river, from which its gardens and groves, thickly interspersed with mansions, and covering seventy furlongs from north to south, and twenty from east to west, were divided by a strip of wilderness. The town had had an eventful history. Once the stronghold of the Canaanites, it was still, in the days of Christ, surrounded by towers and castles. A great stone aqueduct of eleven arches brought a copious supply of water to the city, and the Roman military road ran through it. The houses themselves, however, though showy, were not substantial, but were built mostly of sun-dried bricks, like those of Egypt; so that now, as in the similar case of Babylon, Nineveh, or Egypt, after long desolation, hardly a trace of them remains." <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude</span>. A vast crowd of pilgrims, bound for Jerusalem to keep the Passover, accompanied Jesus and his disciples. The number of people that this great festival attracted to the central place of worship seems to us incredibly large. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09. 3) reckons them at three millions. Doubtless our Lord was followed by many of those whom he had benefited, and others whom he had won by his teaching; and these, at any rate, would witness the ensuing miracle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two blind men.</span> St. Matthew is doubtless accurate in this statement. Tradition might easily drop one of the sufferers in the course of time, but it is not likely to have multiplied one into two. These sufferers had heard of the miracles of healing performed by Jesus in his various circuits, and especially of the late cure at Jerusalem of one born blind, and they were ready to believe in his power and to profit by his mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Heard</span>. The beggars (<a href="../../par/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>), debarred from sight, had their attention aroused by the tread of numerous feet, and the voices of the excited crowd, and naturally asked the bystanders to tell them what it all meant. When they heard that Jesus was there, the hope of relief immediately rushed into their mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David!</span> "O Lord" is only the usual respectful address of an inferior to one in higher station; but to call on Jesus as "Son of David" was virtually to acknowledge him to be the Messiah, who, as old prophets foretold, was to open the eyes of the blind (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>). The same cry had been raised by the blind men who were cured earlier in the ministry (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>), and by the Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>, where see note), How these men had learned the truth we know not; they could not see or read for themselves; their faith must have come by hearing, and the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-31.htm">Matthew 20:31</a></div><div class="verse">And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rebuked them, because</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">in order that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they should hold their peace.</span> The motive of the crowd, in thus silencing the blind men, has been explained in two ways - either they grudged that Christ should be addressed by the high title of "Son of David;" or they desired to spare him unseemly importunity and unreasonable interruption in his journey. As the multitude show no signs of hostility at this time, the latter suggestion seems most probable. <span class="cmt_word">They cried</span> <span class="cmt_word">the more.</span> The attempted check only made them more earnest in their entreaty. The opportunity now offered might never present itself again. The  officious interference of unsympathizing bystanders was at once brushed aside. They could attract Christ's attention only by their passionate cry, and this they continued to utter with renewed energy. Faith resists opposition and triumphs over all impediments.

He acknowledged the title of "Son of David," and, as the blind men could not follow him, he stopped his progress; their perseverance won his acceptance; he was ready to listen to their appeal and to grant their request. <span class="cmt_word">Called them.</span> The gracious summons left them in no doubt as to the happy issue of their prayer. St. Mark speaks of the joyful alacrity with which the blind man obeyed the call; how he "cast away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">What will ye that I shall do unto you?</span> The Lord knew the desire of their hearts, but he wished to draw forth the public confession of their needs, and the distinct blessing which they craved, that all the bystanders might acknowledge the miracle, and the sufferers themselves might be incited more vehemently to urge their plea, and thus become more worthy of relief. So God knows all our necessities before we ask, but he will have our prayers, that we may cooperate with him in the work which he purposes to accomplish.

They had at first asked vaguely for mercy, now they prayed definitely for sight - an example to all to make their supplications for particular graces and mercies, and not to be content with general terms which do not describe their special wants. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/20-34.htm">Matthew 20:34</a></div><div class="verse">So Jesus had compassion <i>on them</i>, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Touched their</span> <span class="cmt_word">eyes.</span> Only St. Matthew mentions this action of our Lord; but in all other cases of the cure of blindness the healing touch of the Man accompanied the word of the God (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-29.htm">Matthew 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>), and Christ did not now depart from his usual practice. Thus, as we have noticed before, he connected the cure with himself. He proved that his flesh taken unto the Godhead was life-giving, remedial, efficacious; and he confirmed the faith of the sufferers and bystanders by showing that there was no deceit or collusion. The other synoptists give Christ's assurance to the men, that the restoration of their sight was the reward of faith - a faith exhibited by the invocation of Jesus as "Son of David," by continued importunity amid surrounding difficulties, by confidence in his power and willingness to heal brought to a point by Christ's question, "What will ye that I shall do unto you?" <span class="cmt_word">They followed him.</span> A fact only less remarkable than the miracle that led to it. The impulse of a grateful heart drew them along the road which the Saviour travelled. They may have accompanied him to Jerusalem, and joined the applauding multitude which escorted him to the holy city, and employed their new power of sight in observing that wonderful spectacle which the next few days afforded. One, at any rate, of these men, Bartimaeus, seems to have become known in the early Church as a devoted follower of Christ, and hence his name is recorded for all time in the sacred narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/21.htm"><title>Matthew 21 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/21.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/21.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/21-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/20.htm" title="Matthew 20">&#9668;</a> Matthew 21 <a href="../matthew/22.htm" title="Matthew 22">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a></div><div class="verse">And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Triumphal entry into Jerusalem</span>.

If, as is believed, his crucifixion took place on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, the triumphal entry must be assigned to the ninth, which day was reckoned to commence at one sunset and to continue till the follow-lug evening. This is regarded as the first day of the Holy Week, and is called by Christians from very early times Palm Sunday (see on ver. 10). He had probably gone straight from Jericho to Bethany. and spent the sabbath there with his friends (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bethphage</span>.

Bethany is below the summit, in a nook on the western slope and somewhat further from the city.

The deliberate preparation for t. he procession, and the intentional publicity, so contrary to Christ's usual habits, are very remarkable, and can be explained only by the fact that he was now assuming the character and claims of Messiah, and putting himself forward in his true dignity and office as "King of the Jews." By this display he made manifest that in him prophecy was fulfilled, and that the seeing eye and the believing heart might now find all that righteous men had long and wearily desired. This was the great opportunity which his mercy offered to Jerusalem, if only she would accept it and turn it to account. In fact, she acknowledged him as King one day, and then rejected and crucified him.

Doubtless the owner of the animals was a disciple, and acknowledged the claims of Jesus. His presence here was a providentially guided coincidence. If he was a stranger; as others suppose, be must have been divinely prompted to acquiesce in the appropriation of his beasts. <span class="cmt_word">He will send them.</span> Some manuscripts read, "he sends them," here, as in St. Mark. The present is more forcible, but the future is well attested. The simple announcement that the asses were needed for God's service would silence all refusal. The disciples, indeed, were to act at once, as executing the orders of the supreme Lord, and were to use the given answer only in case of any objection. Throughout the transaction Christ assumes the character of the Divine Messiah, King of his people, the real Owner of all that they possess. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this was done;</span> <span class="accented">now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) all <span class="accented">this hath come to pass</span>.

This observation of the evangelist is intended to convey the truth that Christ was acting consciously on the lines of old prophecy, working out the will of God declared beforehand by divinely inspired seers. The disciples acted in blind obedience to Christ's command, not knowing that they were thus fulfilling prophecy, or having any such purpose in mind. The knowledge came afterwards (see <a href="../../par/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That it might be fulfilled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). The conjuction in this phrase is certainly used in its final, not in a consecutive or ecbatie sense; it denotes the purpose or design of the action of Christ, not the result. Not only the will of the Father, but the words of Scripture, had delineated the life of Christ, and in obeying that will he purposed to show that he fulfilled the prophecies which spake of him. Thus any who knew the Scriptures, and were open to conviction, might see that it was he alone to whom these ancient oracles pointed, and in him alone were their words accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, with a hint of <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>, a quotation being often woven from two or more passages (see on Matthew 27:9).

The passage in Zechariah begins, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem." The "daughter of Zion" is Jerusalem herself, named from the chief of the hills on which the city was built. Of course, the term includes all the inhabitants. <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>; marking the suddenness and unexpected nature of the event. <span class="cmt_word">Thy King.</span> A King of thine own race, no stranger, one predestined for thee, foretold by all the prophets, who was to occupy the throne of David and to reign forever. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee.</span> For thy special good, to make his abode with thee (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meek</span>. As Christ himself says, "I am meek and lowly in heart" (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>), far removed from pomp and warlike greatness; and yet, according to his own Beatitude, the meek shall inherit the earth (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>), win victories which material forces can never obtain, triumph through humiliation. The original in Zechariah gives other characteristics of Messiah: "He is just, and having salvation;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. endowed with salvation, either as being protected by God, or victorious and so able to save his people. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon an ass.</span> Coming as King, he could not walk undistinguished among the crowd; he must ride. But to mount a war horse would denote that he was leader of an army or a worldly potentate; so he rides upon an ass, an animal used by the judges of Israel, and chieftains on peaceful errands (<a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>); one, too, greatly valued, and often of stately appearance in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">a colt the foal of an ass;</span> such as she asses bear, and one not trained. It is questioned whether the conjunction here expresses addition, implying that Christ mounted both animals in succession, or is merely explanatory, equivalent to videlicet, <span class="accented">an ass, yea, even the foal of an ass</span>. It seems unlikely that, in accomplishing the short distance between Bethphage and Jerusalem (only a mile or two), our Lord should have changed from one beast to the other; and the other three evangelists say expressly that Christ rode the colt, omitting all mention of the mother. The she ass doubtless kept close to its foal, so the prophecy was exactly fulfilled, but the animal that bore the Saviour was the colt. If the two animals represent respectively the Jews and Gentiles (see on ver. 2), it seems hardly necessary for typical reasons that Jesus should thus symbolize his triumph over the disciplined Jews, while it is obvious that the lesson of his supremacy over the untaught Gentiles needed exemplification. The prophet certainly contemplates the two animals in the procession. "The old theocracy runs idly and  instinctively by the side of the young Church, which has become the true bearer of the Divinity of Christ" (Lange). No king had ever thus come to Jerusalem; such a circumstance was predicted of Messiah alone, and Christ alone fulfilled it to the letter, showing of what nature his kingdom was.

Thus the received text, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et eum desuper sedere fecerunt</span>. But most modern editors, with great manuscriptural authority, read, "he sat thereon." Some have taken the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the beasts, and Alford supports the opinion by the common saying, "The postilion rode on the horses," when, in fact, he rode only one of the pair. But the analogy is erroneous. The postilion really guides and controls both; but no one contends that Christ kept the mother ass in hand while mounted on the colt. The pronoun is more suitably referred to the garments, which formed a saddle for the Saviour, or housings and ornamental appendages (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>). He came invested with a certain dignity and pomp, yet in such humble guise as to discountenance all idea of temporal sovereignty.

This interpretation has classical authority (see Alford), but the words may well mean," the very great multitude;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">plurima autem turba</span>.

Such honours were often paid to great men, and indeed, as we well know, are offered now on state occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Branches from the trees</span>. St. John (<a href="../../par/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>) particularizes palm trees as having been used on this occasion; but there was abundance of olive and other trees, from which branches and leaves could be cut or plucked to adorn the Saviour's road. The people appear to have behaved on this occasion as if at the Feast of Tabernacles, roused by enthusiasm to unpremeditated action. Of the three routes which lay before him, Jesus is supposed to have taken the southern and most frequented, between the Mount of Olives and the Hill of Offence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The multitudes that went before, and that followed</span>. These expressions point to two separate bodies, which combined in escorting Jesus at a certain portion of the route. We learn from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18</a>) that much people, greatly excited by the news of the raising of Lazarus, when they heard that he was in the neighbourhood, hurried forth from Jerusalem to meet and do him honour. These, when they met the other procession with Jesus riding in the midst, turned back again and preceded him into the city. St. Luke identifies the spot as "at the descent of the Mount of Olives." "As they approached the shoulder of the hill," says Dr. Geikie ('The Life of Christ,' 2:397), "where the road bends downwards to the north, the sparse vegetation of the eastern slope changed, as in a moment, to the rich green of garden and trees, and Jerusalem in its glory rose before them. It is hard for us to imagine now the splendour of the view. The city of God, seated on her hills, shone at the moment in the morning sun. Straight before stretched the vast white walls and buildings of the temple, its courts glittering with gold, rising one above the other; the steep sides of the hill of David crowned with lofty walls; the mighty castles towering above them; the sumptuous palace of Herod in its green parks; and the picturesque outlines of the streets." <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna to the Son of David!</span> "Hosanna!" is compounded of two words meaning "save" and "now," or, "I pray," and is written in full <span class="accented">Hoshia-na</span>, translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>. The expressions uttered by the people are mostly derived from <a href="../../par/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, which formed part of the great Hallel (<a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>.) sung at the Feast of Tabernacles. "Hosanna!" was originally a formula of prayer and supplication, but later became a term of joy and congratulation. So here the cry signifies "Blessings on [or, 'Jehovah bless'] the Son of David!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Messiah, acknowledging Jesus to be he, the promised Prince of David's line. Thus we say, "God save the king!" This, which Ewald calls the first Christian hymn, gave to Palm Sunday, in some parts of the Church, the name of the "day of Hosannas," and was incorporated into the liturgical service both in East and West. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed...  of the Lord:</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>). The formula is taken in two ways, the words, "ill the Name of the Lord," being connected either with "blessed" or with "cometh." In the former case the cry  signifies, "The blessing of Jehovah rest on him who cometh!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, Messiah (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); in the latter, the meaning is, "Blessing on him who cometh with Divine mission, sent with the authority of Jehovah!" The second interpretation seems to be correct. <span class="cmt_word">In the highest</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). The people cry to God to ratify in heaven the blessing which they invoke on earth. This homage and the title of Messiah Jesus now accepts as his due, openly asserting his claims, and by his acquiescence encouraging the excitement. St. Matthew omits the touching scene of Christ's lamentations over Jerusalem, as he passed the spot where Roman legions would, a generation hence, encamp against the doomed city. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a></div><div class="verse">And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was come into Jerusalem.</span> Those who consider that the day of this event was the tenth of Nisan see a peculiar fitness in the entry occurring on this day. On the tenth of this month the Paschal lamb was selected and taken up preparatory to its sacrifice four days after (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). So the true Paschal Lamb now is escorted to the place where alone the Passover could be sacrificed. Taking A.D.  to be the date of the Crucifixion, astronomers inform us that in that year the first day of Nisan fell on March 24. Consequently, the tenth would be on Sunday, April 2, and the fourteenth was reckoned item sunset of Thursday, April 6, to the sunset of Friday, April 7 (see on ver. 1, and preliminary note ch. 26.). <span class="cmt_word">Was moved</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">was shaken</span>, as by an earthquake. St. Matthew alone mentions this commotion, though St. John (<a href="../../par/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>) makes allusion to it, when he reports the vindictive exclamation of the Pharisees, "Behold, the world is gone after him!" Jerusalem had been stirred and troubled once before, when the Wise Men walked through the streets, inquiring, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2, 3</a>). But the excitement was far greater now, more general, composed of many different elements. The Romans expected some public rising; the Pharisaical party was aroused to new envy and malice; the Herodians dreaded a possible usurper; but the populace entertained for the moment the idea that their hopes were now fulfilled, that the long desired Messiah had at last appeared, and would lead them to victory. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this?</span> The question may have been put by the strangers who came from all parts of the world to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem, or by the crowds in the streets, when they beheld the unusual procession that was advancing.

They give his name, title, and dwelling place. They call him "the Prophet," either as being the One that was foretold (<a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>), or as being inspired and commissioned by God (<a href="../../par/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.17). The appellation, "of Nazareth," clung to our Lord through all his earthly life. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>) notes that the prophets had foretold that he was to be called a Nazarene, and that this prediction was in some sort fulfilled by his dwelling at Nazareth. We know not who were the prophets to whom the evangelist refers, and in this obscurity the attempted explanations of exegetes are far from satisfactory; so it is safer to fall back upon the inspired historian's verdict, and to mark the providential accomplishment of the prediction in the title by which Jesus was generally known. Says Isaac Williams, "Friends and foes, chief priests in hate, Pilate in mockery, angels in adoration, disciples in love, Christ himself in lowliness (<a href="../../par/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8</a>), and now the multitudes in simplicity, all proclaim him 'of Nazareth.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> - <span class="accented">The second cleansing of the temple</span>.

This can be gathered from St. Mark's narrative, where it is stated that, on the day of triumph, Jesus was escorted to the temple, but merely "looked round about on all things," and then returned for the night to Bethany, visiting the temple again on the following morning, and driving out those who profaned it. St. Matthew often groups events, not in their proper chronological order, but in a certain logical sequence which corresponded with his design. Thus he connects the cleansing with the triumphal entry, in order to display another example of Christ's self-manifestation at this time, and his purpose to show who he was and to put forth his claims publicly. In this visit of Christ we see the King coming to his palace, the place where his honour dwelleth, the fitting termination of his glorious march. This cleansing of the temple must not be confounded with the earlier incident narrated by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>, etc.). The two acts marked respectively the beginning and close of Christ's earthly ministry, and denote the reverence which he taught for the house and the worshiper God. The part of the temple which he now visited, and which was profaned to secular use, was the court of the Gentiles, separated from the sanctuary by a stone partition, and considered of lesser sanctity, though really an integral part of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Cast out all them that sold and bought.</span> In this large open space  a market had been established, with the connivance, and much to the pecuniary emolument, of the priests. These let out the sacred area, of which they were the appointed guardians, to greedy and irreligious traders, who made a gain of others' piety. We find no trace of this market in the Old Testament; it probably was established after the Captivity, whence the Jews brought back that taste for commercial business and skill in financial matters for which they have ever since been celebrated. In the eyes of worldly-minded men the sanctity of a building and its appendages was no impediment to traffic and trade, hence they were glad to utilize the temple court, under the sanction of the priests, for the convenience of those who came from all regions to celebrate the great festivals. Here was sold all that was required for the sacrifices which worshippers were minded to offer - animals for victims, meal, incense, salt, etc. The scandalous abuse of the holy precincts, or the plain traces of it (if, as it was late in the day, the traffickers themselves had departed for a time), Christ had observed at his previous visit, when he "looked round about upon all things" (<a href="../../par/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>), and now he proceeded to remedy the crying evil The details of the expulsion are not given. On the first occasion, we are told, he used "a scourge of small cords;" as far as we know, at this time he effected the purification unarmed and alone. It was a marvellous impulse that forced the greedy crew to obey the order of this unknown Man; their own consciences made them timid; they fled in dismay before the stern indignation of his eye, deserted their gainful trade to escape the reproach of that invincible zeal. <span class="cmt_word">Money changers.</span> These persons exchanged (for a certain percentage) foreign money or other coins for the half shekel demanded from all adults for the service of the temple (see on Matthew 17:24). They may have lent money to the needy. The sellers also probably played into their bands by refusing to receive any but current Jewish money in exchange for their wares. It is also certain that no coins stamped with a heathen symbol, or bearing a heathen monarch's image, could be paid into the temple treasury. <span class="cmt_word">The seats of</span> <span class="cmt_word">them that sold</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">doves.</span> These birds were used by the poor in the place of costlier victims (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-22.htm">Leviticus 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>). The sellers were often women, who sat with tables before them on which were set cages containing the doves.

He combines in one severe sentence a passage from <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> ("Mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all peoples"), and one from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a> ("Is this house, which is called by my Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?").

These base traffickers had turned the hallowed courts into a cavern where robbers stored their ill-gotten plunder. It may also be said that to make the place of prayer for all the nations a market for boasts was a robbery of the rights of the Gentiles (Lange). And Christ here vindicated the sanctity of the house of God: the Lord, according to the prophecy of Malachi (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>), had suddenly come to his temple to refine and purify, to show that none can profane what is dedicated to the service of God without most certain loss and punishment.

This notice is peculiar to St. Matthew, though St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>) mentions that "he taught daily in the temple." An old expositor has remarked that Christ first as King purified his palace, and then took his seat therein, and of his royal bounty distributed gilts to his people. It was a new fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4-6</a>), which spake of Messiah coming to open the eyes of the blind, to unstop the ears of the deaf, to make the lame man leap as an hart. For acts of sacrilege which profaned the temple precincts, he substituted acts of mercy which hallowed them; the good Physician takes the place of the greedy trafficker; the den of thieves becomes a beneficent hospital. How many were the acts of healing, we are not told; but the words point to the relief of numberless sufferers, none of whom were sent empty away.

It refers to the cleansing of the temple and the cures lately performed there. <span class="cmt_word">Children crying in the temple.</span> This fact is mentioned only by St. Matthew. Jesus loved children, and they loved and followed him, taking up the  cry which they had heard the day before from the multitude, and in simple faith applying it again to Christ. While grown men are silent or blaspheming, little children boldly sing his praises. <span class="cmt_word">Were sore displeased.</span> Their envious hearts could not bear to see Jesus honoured, elevated in men's eyes by his own beneficent actions, and now glorified by the spontaneous acclamations of these little ones.

They recognize that these cries implied high homage, if not actual worship, and appeal to Jesus to put a stop to such unseemly behaviour, approaching, as they would pretend, to formal blasphemy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. Jesus replies that he hears what the children say, but sees no reason for silencing them; rather he proves that they were only fulfilling an old prophecy, originally, indeed, applied to Jehovah, but one which he claims as addressed to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Have ye never read?</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>). The quotation is from the confessedly Messianic psalm (<a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.), a psalm very often quoted in the New Testament, and as speaking of Christ (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sucklings</span>. This term was applied to children up to the age of three years (see 2 Macc. 7:27), but might be used metaphorically of those of tender age, though long weaned. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast perfected praise.</span> The words are from the Septuagint, which seems to have preserved the original reading. The present Hebrew text gives, "Thou hast ordained strength," or "established a power." In the Lord's mouth the citation signifies that God is praised acceptably by the weak and ignorant when, following the impulse of their simple nature, they do him homage. Some expositors combine the force of the Hebrew and Greek by explaining that "the strength of the weak is praise, and that worship of Christ is strength" (Wordsworth). It is more simple to say, with Nosgen, that for the Hebrew "strength," "praise" is substituted, in order to give the idea that the children's acclamation was that which would still the enemy, as it certainly put to shame the captious objections of the Pharisees. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a></div><div class="verse">And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He left them</span>. The chief priests had nothing to say in reply to this testimony of Scripture. They feared to arrest him in the face of the enthusiastic multitude; they bided their time, for the present apparently silenced. Jesus, wasting no further argument on these wilfully unbelieving people, turned and left them. The King had no home in his royal city; he sought one in lowly Bethany, where he was always sure of a welcome in the house of Martha and Mary. It is somewhat doubtful whether he availed himself of his friends' hospitality at this time. The term "Bethany" would include the district so called in the vicinity of the town, as in the description of the scene of the Ascension (<a href="../../par/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lodged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). This word, if its strict classical use is pressed, would imply that Jesus passed the night in the open air; but it may mean merely "lodge," or "pass the night," without any further connotation; so no certain inference can be drawn from its employment in this passage. This withdrawal of Jesus obviated all danger of a rising in his favour, which, supported by the vast resources of the temple, might have had momentous consequences at this time of popular concourse and excitement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18</a></div><div class="verse">Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - <span class="accented">The cursing of the barren fig tree</span>.

St. Matthew has combined in one view a transaction which had two separate stages, as we gather from the narrative of St. Mark. The curse was uttered on the Monday morning, before the cleansing of the temple; the effect was beheld and the lesson given on the Tuesday, when Jesus was visiting Jerusalem for the third time (vers. 20-22). Strauss and his followers, resenting the miraculous in the incident, have imagined that the whole story is merely an embodiment and development of the parable of the fruitless fig tree recorded by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6</a>, etc.), which in course of time assumed this historical form. There is no ground whatever for this idea. It claims to be, and doubtless is, the account of a real fact, naturally connected with the circumstances of the time, and of great practical importance. <span class="cmt_word">He hungered.</span> True Man, he showed the weakness of his human nature, even when about to exert his power in the Divine. There is no need, rather it is unseemly to suppose (as many old commentators have done), that this hunger was miraculous or assumed, in order to give occasion for the coming miracle. Christ had either passed the night on the mountain-side in prayer and fasting, or had started from his lodging without breaking his fast. His followers do not seem to have suffered in the same way; and it was doubtless owing to his mental preoccupation and self-forgetfulness that the Lord had not attended to bodily wants. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a></div><div class="verse">And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he saw a</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">a single</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fig tree in the way.</span> The tree stood all alone in a conspicuous situation by the roadside, as if courting observation. It was allowable to pluck and eat fruit in an  orchard (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24, 25</a>); but this tree, placed where it was, seemed to be common property, belonging to no private owner. The sight of the leaves thereon, as St. Mark tells us, attracted the notice of Christ, who beheld with pleasure the prospect of relieving his long abstinence with the refreshment of cool and juicy fruit. <span class="cmt_word">He came to it.</span> Knowing the nature of the tree, and that under some circumstances the fruit ripens before the leaves are fully out, Jesus naturally expected to find on it some figs fit to eat. Further, besides the fruit which comes to maturity in the usual way during the summer, there are often late figs produced in autumn which hang on the tree during winter, and ripen at the reawakening of vegetation in the spring. The vigour of this particular tree was apparently proved by the luxuriance of its foliage, and it might reasonably be expected to retain some of its winter produce. <span class="cmt_word">Found nothing thereon, but leaves only</span>. It was all outward show, promise without performance, seeming precocity with no adequate results. There is no question here of Christ's omniscience being at fault. He acted as a man would act; he was not deceived himself nor did he deceive the apostles, though they at first misapprehended his purpose. The whole action was symbolical, and was meant so to appear. In strict propriety of conduct, as a man led by the appearance of the tree might act, he carried out the figure, at the same time showing, by his treatment of this inanimate object, that he had something higher in view, and that he does not mean that which his outward conduct seemed to imply. He is enacting a parable where all the parts are in due keeping, and all have their twofold signification in the world of nature and the world of grace. The hunger is real, the tree is real, the expectation of fruit legitimate, the barrenness disappointing and criminal; the spiritual side, however, is left to be inferred, and, as we shall see, only one of many possible lessons is drawn from the result of the incident. <span class="cmt_word">Let no fruit grow on thee</span> (<span class="accented">let there be no fruit from thee</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>henceforward forever</span>. Such is the sentence passed on this ostentations tree. Christ addresses it as if replying to the profession made by its show of leaves. It had the sap of life, it had power to produce luxuriant leaves; therefore it might and ought to have borne fruit. It vaunted itself as being superior to its neighbours, and the boast was utterly empty. <span class="cmt_word">Presently</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree withered away.</span> The process was doubtless gradual, commencing at Christ's word, and continuing till the tree died; but St. Matthew completes the account at once, giving in one picture the event, with its surroundings and results. It was a moral necessity that what had incurred Christ's censure should perish; the spiritual controlled the material; the higher overbore the lower. Thus the designed teaching was placed in visible shape before the eyes, and silently uttered its important lesson. It has been remarked (by Neander) that we are not to suppose that the tree thus handled was previously altogether sound and healthy. Its show of leaves at an unusual period without fruit may point to some abnormal development of activity which was consequent upon some radical defect. Had it been in vigorous health, it would not have been a fitting symbol of the Jewish Church; nor would it have corresponded with the idea which Christ designed to bring to the notice of his apostles. There was already some process at work which would have issued in decay, and Christ's curse merely accelerated this natural result. This is considered to be the only instance in which our Lord exerted his miraculous power in destruction; all his other actions were beneficent, saving, gracious. The drowning of the swine at Gadara was only permitted for a wise purpose; it was not commanded or inflicted by him. The whole transaction in our text is mysterious. That the Son of man should show wrath against a senseless tree, as tree, is, of course, not conceivable. Them was an apparent unfitness, if not injustice, in the proceeding, which at once demonstrated that the tree was not the real object of the action - that something more important was in view. Christ does not treat trees as moral agents, responsible for life and action. He uses inanimate objects to convey lessons to men, dealing with them according to his good pleasure, even his supreme will, which is the law by which they are controlled. In themselves they have no fault and incur no punishment, but they are treated in such a way as to profit the nobler creatures of God's hand. There may have been two reasons for Christ's conduct which were not set prominently forward at the time. First, he desired to show his power, his absolute control, over material forces, so that, in what was about to happen to him, his apostles might be sure that he suffered not through weakness or compulsion, but because he willed to have it so. This would prepare his followers for his own and their coming trials. Then there was another great lesson taught by the sign. The fig tree is a symbol of the Jewish Church. The prophets had used both it. and the vine in this connection (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>), and our Lord himself makes an unmistakable allusion in his parable of  the fig tree planted in the vineyard, from which the owner for three years sought fruit in vain (<a href="../../par/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6</a>, etc.). Many of his subsequent discourses are, as it were, commentaries upon this incident (see vers. 28-44; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23-25</a>.). Here was a parable enacted. The Saviour had seen this tree, the Jewish Church, afar off, looking down upon it from heaven; it was one, single, standing conspicuous among all nations as that whereon the Lord had lavished most care, that which ought to have shown the effect of this culture in abundant produce of holiness and righteousness. But what was the result? Boasting to be children of Abraham, the special heritage of Jehovah, gifted with highest privileges, the sole possessors of the knowledge of God, the Israelites professed to have what no other people had, and were in reality empty and bare. There was plenty of outward show - rites, ceremonies, scrupulous observances, much speaking - but no real devotion, no righteousness, no heart worship, no good works. Other nations, indeed, were equally fruitless, but they did not profess to be holy; they were sinners, and offered no cloak for their sinfulness. The Jews were no less unrighteous; but they were hypocrites, and boasted of the good which they had not. Other nations were unproductive, for their time had not come; but for Israel the season had arrived; she ought to have been the first to accept the Messiah, to unite the new with the old fruit, to pass from the Law to the gospel, and to learn and practise the lesson of faith. Perfect fruit was not yet to be expected; but Israel's sin was that she vaunted her perfection, counted herself sound and whole, while rotten at the very core, and barren of all good results. Her falsehood, hypocrisy, and arrogant complacency were fearfully punished. The terms of the curse pronounced by the Judge are very emphatic. It denounces perpetual barrenness on the Jewish Church and people. From Judaea was to have gone forth the healing of the nations; from it all peoples of the earth were to be blessed. The complete fulfilment of this promise is no longer in the literal Israel; she is nothing in the world; no one resorts to her for food and refreshment; she has none to offer the wayfarer. For eighteen centuries has that fruitlessness continued; the withered tree still stands, a monument of unbelief and its punishment. The Lord's sentence, "forever," must be understood with some limitation. In his parable of the fig tree, which adumbrates the last days, he intimates that it shall some day bud and blossom, and be clothed once more with leaf and fruit; and St. Paul looks forward to the conversion of Israel, when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (<a href="../../par/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-20.htm">Matthew 21:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when the disciples saw <i>it</i>, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They marvelled, saying.</span> The apostles' remark on the incident was made on the Tuesday, as we learn from St. Mark's more accurate account. After Christ had spoken his malediction, the little band went on their way to Jerusalem, where was performed the cleansing of the temple. On their return to Bethany, if they passed the tree, it was doubtless too dark to observe its present condition, and it was not till the next morning that they noticed what had happened. St. Matthew does not name the apostle who was the mouthpiece of the others in expressing astonishment at the miracle; he is satisfied with speaking generally of "the disciples" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> with <a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>). We learn from St. Mark that it was Peter who made the observation recorded, deeply affected by the sight of this instance of Christ's power, and awestruck by the speedy and complete accomplishment of the curse. <span class="cmt_word">How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> better, <span class="accented">How did the fig tree immediately wither away?</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo continue aruit?</span> They saw, but could not comprehend, the effect of Christ's word, and wonderingly inquired how it came to pass. They did not at present realize the teaching of this parabolic act - how it gave solemn warning of the certainty of judgment on the unfruitful Jewish Church, which, hopelessly barren, must no longer cumber the earth. Christ did not help them to understand the typical nature of the transaction. He is not wont to explain in words the spiritual significance of his miracles; the connection between miracle and teaching is left to be inferred, to be brought out by meditation, prayer, faith, and subsequent circumstances. The total rejection of the Jews was a doctrine for which the apostles were not yet prepared; so the Lord, in wisdom and mercy, withheld its express enunciation at this moment. In mercy too he exemplified the sternness and severity of God's judgment by inflicting punishment on an inanimate object, and not on a sentient being; he withered a tree, not a sinful man, by the breath of his mouth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this <i>which is done</i> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered.</span> To the apostles' question the Lord makes reply, drawing a lesson, not such as we should have expected, but one of quite a different nature, yet one which was naturally deduced from the transaction which had excited such astonishment. They marvelled at this incident; let them have and exercise faith. and they should do greater things than this. Christ had already made a similar answer after the cure of the demoniac boy (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith, and doubt not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The whole phrase  expresses the perfection of the grace. The latter verb means "to discriminate," to see a difference in things, hence to debate in one's mind. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Si habueritis fidem, et non haesitaveritis</span>. What is here enjoined is that temper of mind which does not stop hesitatingly to consider whether a thing can be done or not, but believes that all is possible - that one can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. So the apostles are assured by Christ that they should not only be able to wither a tree with a word, but should accomplish far more difficult undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">This</span> which is done to <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); as, "what was befallen to them that were possessed with devils (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-33.htm">Matthew 8:33</a>). The promise may intimate that it was to be through the preaching of the apostles, and the Jews' rejection of the salvation offered by them, that the judgment should fall on the chosen people. Thus they would do what was done to the fig tree. And in the following words we may see a prophecy of the destruction of the mountain of paganism. Or it may mean that theocratic Judaism must be cast into the sea of nations before the Church of Christ should reach its full development (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">This mountain.</span> As he speaks, he points to the Mount of Olivet, on which they were standing, or to Moriah crowned by the glorious temple. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou removed;</span> <span class="accented">be thou taken up</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not the same word as in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Mediterranean (see a similar promise, <a href="../../par/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be done.</span> It was not likely that any such material miracle would literally be needed, and no one would ever pray for such a sign; but the expression is hyperbolically used to denote the performance of things most difficult and apparently impossible (see <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>).

The faith required is the assurance of things hoped for, such as gives substance and being to them while yet out of sight. The words had their special application to the apostles, instructing them that they were not to expect to be able, like their Master, to work the wonders needed for the confirmation of the gospel by their own power. Such effects could be achieved only by prayer and faith. (On the general promise to faithful prayer, see <a href="../../par/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>.)

The conversation recorded here belongs to the Tuesday of the Holy Week, and took place in the courts of the temple, at this time filled with pilgrims from all parts of the world, who hung upon Christ's words, and beheld his doings with wonder and awe. This sight roused to fury the envy and anger of the authorities, and they sent forth sections of their cleverest men to undermine his authority in the eyes of the people, or to force from him statements on which they might found criminal accusation against him. <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests and the elders of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> According to the other evangelists, there were also scribes, teachers of the Law, united with them in this deputation, which thus comprised all the elements of the Sanhedrin. This seems to have been the first time that the council took formal notice of Jesus' claims and actions, and demanded from him personally an account of himself. They had been quick enough in inquiring into the Baptist's credentials, when he suddenly appeared on the banks of Jordan (see <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>, etc.); but they had studiously, till quite lately, avoided any regular investigation of the pretensions of Jesus. In the thee of late proceedings, this could no longer be delayed. A crisis had arrived; their own peculiar province was publicly invaded, and their authority attacked; the opponent must be withstood by the action of the constituted court. <span class="cmt_word">As he was teaching.</span> Jesus did not confine himself to beneficent acts; he used the opportunity of the gathering of crowds around him to preach unto them the gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/20-1.htm">Luke 20:1</a>), to teach truths which came with double force from One who bad done such marvellous things. <span class="cmt_word">By what authority doest thou these things?</span> They refer to the triumphal entry, the reception of the homage offered, the healing of the blind and lame, the teaching as with the authority of a rabbi, and especially to the cleansing of the temple. No one could presume to teach without a proper commission: where was his authorization? They were the guardians and rulers of the temple: what right had he  to interfere with their management, and to use the sacred precincts for his own purposes? These and such like questions were in their mind when they addressed him thus. Wilfully ignoring the many proofs they had of Christ's Divine mission (which one of them, Nicodemus, had long before been constrained to own, <a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), they raised the question now as a novel and unanswered one. <span class="cmt_word">Who gave thee this authority?</span> They resolve the general inquiry into the personal one - Who was it that conferred upon you this authority which you presume to exercise? Was it some earthly ruler, or was it God himself? Perhaps they mean to insinuate that Satan was the master whose power he wielded - an accusation already often made. They thought thus to place Christ in an embarrassing position, from which he could not emerge without affording the opportunity which they desired. The trap was cleverly set, and, as they deemed, unavoidable. If he was forced to confess that he spoke and acted without any proper authorization, he would be humiliated in the eyes of the people, and might be officially silenced by the strong hand. If he asserted himself to be the Messiah and the bearer of a Divine commission, they would at once bring against him a charge of blasphemy (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>).

Before he satisfied their inquiry, he must have their opinion concerning one whom they had received as a prophet a few years ago, and whose memory was still held in the highest respect, John the Baptist. The manner in which they regarded him and his testimony would enable them to answer their own interrogation.

And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The baptism of John</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). By "the baptism which was of John" Christ means his whole ministry, doctrine, preaching, etc.; as by circumcision is implied the whole Mosaic Law, and the doctrine of the cross comprises all the teaching of the gospel, the chief characteristic connoting all particulars. <span class="cmt_word">From heaven, or of men?</span> Did they regard John as one inspired and commissioned by God, or as a fanatic and impostor, who was self-sent and had received no external authorization? Now, two facts were plain and could not be denied. The rulers and the people with them had allowed John to be a prophet, and had never questioned his claims hitherto. This was one fact; the other was that John had borne unmistakable evidence to Christ. "Behold the Lamb of God!" etc. (<a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-36</a>), he had said. He came and asserted that he came as Christ's forerunner; his mission was to prepare Christ's way, and had no meaning or intention but this. Here was a dilemma. They had asked for Jesus' credentials; the prophet, whose mission they had virtually endorsed testified that Jesus was the Messiah; if they believed that John spoke by inspiration, they must accept Christ; if now they discredited John, they would stultify themselves and endanger their influence with the people. <span class="cmt_word">They reasoned with themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The somewhat unusual introduction of this preposition instead of the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> implies that the reflection was not confined to their own breast, but passed in consultation from one to another. They saw the difficulty, and deliberated how they could meet it without compromising themselves, seeking, not truth, but evasion. <span class="cmt_word">Why did ye not then</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">why then did ye not</span>) <span class="cmt_word">believe him?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when he bore such plain testimony to me. This appeal could be silenced only by denying John's mission, or asserting that he was mistaken in what he said, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-26.htm">Matthew 21:26</a></div><div class="verse">But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We fear the people</span>. They dared not, as they would gladly have done, affirm that John was a false prophet and impostor; for then, as according to St. Luke they said, "All the people will stone us." Public opinion was too strong for them. Whatever view they really took of John's position, they were forced, for the sake of retaining popularity, to uphold its Divine character. <span class="cmt_word">All hold John as a prophet.</span> Even Herod, for the same reason, long hesitated to put the Baptist to death (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>); and many of the Jews believed that Herod's defeat by Aretas was a judgment upon him for this murder (Josephus,' Ant.,' 18:5. 2); comp. <a href="../../par/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29</a>, which shows how extensive was the influence of this holy teacher, who indeed did no miracle, but persuaded men by pure doctrine, holy life, genuine love of souls, courageous reproof of sin wherever found. Others had drawn the very inference which Christ now demanded (see <a href="../../par/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41, 42</a>).

The Authorized Version seems, at first sight, to be intended to give a false emphasis to "tell" in Christ's answer; but our translators often render the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> in this way (see <a href="../../par/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-18.htm">John 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). The questioners could find no way out of the dilemma in which Christ's unerring wisdom  had placed them. Their evasive answer was a confession of defeat, and that in the presence of the gaping crowd who stood around listening to the conversation. They had every opportunity of judging the character of John's mission and that of Christ; it was their duty to form an opinion and to pronounce a verdict on such claims; and yet they, the leaders and teachers of Israel, for fear of compromising themselves, evade the obligation, refuse to solve or even to entertain the question, and, like a modern agnostic, content themselves with a profession of ignorance. Many people, to avoid looking a disagreeable truth in the face, respond to all appeals with the stereotyped phrase, "We cannot tell." F.M. appositely quotes the comment of Donatus on Terent., 'Eunuch.,' 5:4, 31, "Perturbatur Parmeno; nec negare potuit, nec consentire volebat; sed quasi defensionis loco dixit, <span class="accented">Nescio</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And he said unto them;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">he also said unto them</span>. The Lord answers the thought which had dictated their words to him. <span class="cmt_word">Neither tell I you,</span> etc. With such double-minded men, who could give no clear decision concerning the mission of such a one as John the Baptist, it would be mere waste of words to argue further. They would not accept his testimony, and recognizing their malice and perversity, he declined to instruct them further. "Christ shows," says Jerome, "that they knew and were unwilling to answer; and that he knew, but held his peace, because they refused to utter what they well knew."

Christ's reply countenances the received text, setting the repentant before the professing son. It is a matter of small importance (see Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). "The first son "here typifies the evil and immoral among the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>, <span class="accented">work</span> <span class="cmt_word">today.</span> Two emphatic imperatives.

He called them by the prophets, and more especially by John the Baptist, to turn from evil ways, and to do works meet for repentance (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). Christ gives two examples, showing how this call was received.

We must remark that the Lord has no censure for those who sometime were disobedient, but afterwards repented; his rebuke falls on the professors and self-righteous, who ought to have been leaders and guides, and were in truth impious and irreligious. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-32.htm">Matthew 21:32</a></div><div class="verse">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen <i>it</i>, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For John came unto you.</span> This gives the reason for Christ's assertion at the end of the last verse. John came with a special call to the rulers of the people, and they made some show of interest, by sending a deputation to demand his credentials, and by coming to his baptism; but that was all. They did not alter their lives or change their faulty opinions at his preaching, though they "were willing for a season to rejoice in his light" (<a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the way of righteousness.</span> In that path of strict obedience to law, and of ascetic holiness, which you profess to regard so highly. If they had followed the path which John indicated, they would have attained to righteousness and salvation. John preached Christ who is "the Way" (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). (For "way," meaning doctrine, religious tenet and practice, see <a href="../../par/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Ye believed him not,</span> to any practical purpose, even as it is said elsewhere (<a href="../../par/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>), "The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptized of him."

They profited not by this miracle of grace. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might believe him.</span> The end and result of repentance would be to believe in John's mission, and to attend to his teaching. Christ offers the above explanation of the parable (vers. 31, 32) in view of the purpose for which he uttered it. It has been, and may be, taken in different senses, and in wider application. "What is set forth in individual cases is but a sample of what takes place in whole classes of persons, and even nations" (I. Williams). Many expositors consider the two sons to represent Gentiles and Jews; the former making no profession of serving God, and yet in time being converted and turning to him; the latter making much outward show of obedience, yet in reality denying him and rejecting salvation. It is obvious that such explanation is allowable, and coincides with the letter of the parable; but it does not satisfy the context, and fails in not answering to Christ's intention in uttering this similitude. Others see herein a picture of what happens in Christian lands, and is the experience of every Christian minister - how the irreligious and apparently irreclaimable are by God's grace brought, to repentance unto life; how the seemingly pious often make much show, but fall away, or bring no fruit unto perfection. And as the parable involves a general principle, so it may be applied universally to those who make great professions of religion, and are for a time full of good resolutions, but in practice fall very short; and to those who have been the slaves of lust, covetousness, or some other wickedness, but have been recovered from the snares of the devil, and have learned to lead a godly, righteous, and sober life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a></div><div class="verse">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-46.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the vineyard let out to husbandmen</span>. (<a href="../../par/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear another parable.</span> The domineering and lately imperious party are reduced to the position of pupils; they have to listen to teaching, not to give it; to answer, not to put questions. This parable sets forth, under the guise of history, the Pharisaical party in its official character, and as the representative of the nation. It also denounces the punishment that surely awaited these rejecters of the offered salvation; thus exemplifying the teaching of the withered fig tree (vers. 17-20). As applicable to the Jewish nation generally, it represents the long suffering of God and the various means which, in the course of their history, he had used to urge them to do their duty as his servants; and it ends with a prophecy of the coming events, and the terrible issue of impenitence. We must take the parable as partly retrospective, and partly predictive. <span class="cmt_word">There was a certain householder;</span> <span class="accented">a<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> <span class="accented">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">that was an householder</span>. Christ in his parables often, as here, introduces God in his dealings with mankind as a man. His house is the house of Israel in particular, and in general the whole human family. <span class="cmt_word">A vineyard.</span> God's kingdom upon earth, and particularly the Jewish Church. The figure is common throughout Scripture (see on Matthew 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">It was planted</span> when God gave Israel a law, and put them in possession of the promised land. The parable itself is  founded on <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where, however, the vineyard is tended by the Lord himself, not by husbandmen, and it bears wild grapes, not good grapes. By these differences different developments of declension are indicated. In the earlier times it was the nation that apostatized, fell into idolatry and rebellion against God, the theocratical Head of their race and polity. In later days it is the teachers, rabbis, priests, false prophets, who neglect the paths of righteousness, and lead people astray. In the parable these last come into painful prominence as criminally guilty of opposing God's messengers. <span class="cmt_word">Hedged it round;</span> <span class="accented">put a hedge around it</span>. The fence would be a stone wall - a necessary defence against the incursions of wild animals. This fence has been regarded in two senses - first, as referring to the physical peculiarities of the position of the Holy Land, separated from alien nations by deserts, seas, rivers, and so isolated from evil contagion; second, as intimating the peculiar laws and minute restrictions of the Jewish polity, which differentiated Judaism from all other systems of religion, and tended to preserve purity and incorruption. Probably the "hedge" is meant to adumbrate both senses. Many, however, see in it the protection of angels, or the righteousness of saints, which seem hardly to be sufficiently precise for the context. <span class="cmt_word">Digged a winepress</span>. The phrase refers, not to the ordinary wooden troughs or vats which were used for the purpose of expressing and receiving the juice of the grapes, but to such as were cut in the rock, and were common in all parts of the country. Remains of these receptacles meet the traveller everywhere on the hill slopes of Judaea, and notably in the valleys of Carmel. The winepress is taken to signify the prophetic spirit, the temple services, or all things that typified the sacrifice and death of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">A tower;</span> for the purpose of watching and guarding the vineyard. This may represent the temple itself, or the civil power. Whatever interpretation may be put upon the various details, which, indeed, should not be unduly pressed, the general notion is that every care was taken of the Lord's inheritance, nothing was wanting for its convenience and security. <span class="cmt_word">Let it out to husbandmen.</span> This is a new feature introduced into Isaiah's parable. Instead of paying an annual sum of money to the proprietor, these vine dressers payed in kind, furnishing a stipulated amount of fruit or wine as the hire of the vineyard. We have a lease on the former terms in <a href="../../par/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, where the keepers have "to bring a thousand pieces of silver for the fruit." The husbandmen are the children of Israel, who had to do their part in the Church, and show fruits of piety and devotion. <span class="cmt_word">Went into a far country;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">went abroad</span>. In the parabolic sense, God withdrew for a time the sensible tokens of his presence, no longer manifested himself as at Sinai, and in the cloud and pillar of fire. "Innuitur tempus divinae taciturnitatis, ubi homines agunt pro arbitrio" (Bengel). God's long suffering gives time of probation.

In the Jewish history no particular time seems to be signified, but rather such periods or crises which forced God's claims upon men's notice, and made them consider what fruits they had to show for all the Lord's care, how they had lived after receiving the Law. Such times were the ages of Samuel, Elijah, the great prophets, the Maccabees, and John the Baptist. <span class="cmt_word">His servants.</span> The prophets, good kings, priests, and governors. "I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To receive the fruits of it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); or, <span class="accented">his fruits</span>, as rent.

The exaction of rent in kind has always been a fruitful source of dispute, fraud, and discontent. In the Jewish Church God's messengers had been ill treated and put to death (see ch. 23:34-37). "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" cried St. Stephen; "and they have slain them which showed before the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been the betrayers and murderers" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beat...  killed...  stoned.</span> A climax of iniquity and guilt. The statement is probably meant to be general; some, however, endeavour to individualize it, referring the "beating" to the treatment of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1, 2</a>), "killing" to Isaiah (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, "sawn asunder"), "stoning" to Zechariah son of Jehoiada (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20, 21</a>).

The parable now allegorizes the near present, and future, in such a way as for the moment to conceal its bearing, and to lead the hearers to pronounce their own condemnation: <span class="cmt_word">His son.</span> Even Jesus Christ, who was now among them, incarnate, teaching, and demanding of them fruits of righteousness. Here was the authorization which they had required (ver. 23). God sent his Son. <span class="cmt_word">They will reverence my Son.</span> God condescends to speak in human language, as hoping for a good result from this last effort for man's salvation. He, as it were, puts aside his foreknowledge, and gives scope to man's free will. Though the sad issue is known to him, he often acts towards men as if he had hope that they would still use the occasion profitably. In the present case, whereas the immediate result of the last measure was disastrous, the expectation was ultimately realized in the conversion of many Jews to Christianity, which led to the bringing of all nations to the obedience of the faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-38.htm">Matthew 21:38</a></div><div class="verse">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the husbandmen saw the Son.</span> As soon as they recognized this new and important messenger. This is the great element in the guilt of his rejection. They might have had the same consciousness of Christ's Divine mission as Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), having possessed the same opportunities of judging. Ancient prophecy, the signs of the times, the miracles and teaching of Christ, the testimony of the Baptist, pointed to one evident conclusion; evidence had been accumulating on all sides. A latent feeling had grown up that he was the Messiah (see <a href="../../par/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-52</a>), and it was obstinate prejudice and perversity alone that prevented his open acknowledgment. "If I had not come and spoken unto them," said Christ, "they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin" (<a href="../../par/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They said among themselves.</span> They plotted his destruction (see <a href="../../par/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>).

Here the parable bursts from the allegorical form, and becomes history and prophecy. In fact, the possession which the rulers coveted was supremacy over the minds and consciences of men; they wished to lord it over God's heritage; to retain their rights and prerogatives in the present system. This ambition Christ's teaching and action entirely overthrew. They felt no security in their possession of authority while he was present and working in their midst. Were he removed, their position would be safe, their claims undisputed. Hence their conspiracy and its result - a result very far from what they expected. They had their own way, but their gain was ruin. Says St. Augustine, "Ut possiderent, occiderunt; et quia occiderunt, perdiderunt." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-39.htm">Matthew 21:39</a></div><div class="verse">And they caught him, and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard, and slew <i>him</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him</span>. This is prophecy, and alludes to a particular circumstance attending the death of Christ, viz. that he suffered without the city Jerusalem, Calvary being outside the walls (see <a href="../../par/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>, and the parallel passages in the other evangelists, and especially <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 12</a>, where it is significantly noted that Jesus "suffered without the gate"). The words may also contain a reference to the fact that he was excommunicated and given over to the heathen to be judged and condemned, thus suffering not actually at the hands of "the husbandmen" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). Christ, in his Divine prescience, speaks of his Passion and death as already accomplished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-40.htm">Matthew 21:40</a></div><div class="verse">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh;</span> <span class="accented">when therefore the lord</span>, etc. Christ asks his hearers, who are both rulers and people, what in their opinion will be the course taken by the lord when he visits his vineyard, knowing all that has transpired. So Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-3.htm">Isaiah 5:3</a>) makes the people give the verdict: "And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-41.htm">Matthew 21:41</a></div><div class="verse">They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out <i>his</i> vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They say unto him.</span> The Pharisees probably made the reply, not at the moment apprehending the sense of the parable. Or the words were spoken by some of the bystanders, and taken up and emphatically repeated by our Lord with an unmistakable application (ver. 43). The conclusion was a necessary consequence, and this will account for Mark and Luke apparently making them a part of Christ's speech. By their answer they blindly condemn themselves, as David did at hearing Nathan's parable (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will miserably</span> (<span class="greek_word">kakw  =  </span>) <span class="cmt_word">destroy those wicked men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">miserable men</span>); or, <span class="accented">he will evilly destroy those evil men</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Malos male perdet.</span> He will make their punishment equal their crime. The slaughter and mortality at the siege of Jerusalem accomplished this prediction to the letter. <span class="cmt_word">Unto other husbandmen;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Christian ministry, which took the place of the Jewish priests and teachers. As the husbandmen in the parable were rather the rulers and rabbis than the whole nation (which, indeed, only followed their guides), so these others are not the whole  Gentile world, but those who sustained the ministerial offices in the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">of such kind as</span>, denoting a class of servants. The clause is peculiar to Matthew. The speakers did not clearly apprehend the bearing of this detail of the parable. <span class="cmt_word">In their</span> <span class="cmt_word">seasons.</span> The times when the various fruits are ripe and ready for harvesting. These would vary in different climates and under differing circumstances; but the good husbandmen would be always ready to render to their Lord the fruits of faith and obedience, at every holy season and in due proportion. This parable, spoken originally of Israel, applies, like all such similitudes, to the Christian Church and to the human soul. How God dealt with individual Churches we see in his words to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1-3</a>.). Ecclesiastical history furnishes similar examples throughout all ages. God gives privileges, and looks for results worthy of these graces. He sends warnings; he raises up apostles, preachers, evangelists; and if a Church is still unfaithful, he takes away his Spirit, and lets it lapse, and gives its inheritance to others, In the other case, the vineyard is the soul of man, which he has to cultivate for his Master's use. God has hedged it round with the law, external and internal, given it the ministry and sacraments and the Scripture, and looks to it to bring forth the fruits of obedience, service, worship. He sends times of visitation, teaching, warning; he speaks to it by secret inspiration; he calls it in loving tones to closer union. If it hearkens to the call, it walks in the way of salvation; if it refuses to hear, it casts away the hope of its calling, and must share the lot of Christ's enemies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did ye never read?</span> It is as though Christ said, "Ye have answered rightly. You profess to know the Scriptures well; do you not, then, apprehend that Holy Writ foretells that concerning Messiah and his enemies which you have just announced?" The imagery is changed, but the subject is the same as in the preceding parable. The vineyard is now a building; the husbandmen are the builders; the Son is the stone. <span class="cmt_word">In the Scriptures.</span> The quotation is from <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22, 23</a> - the same psalm which was used on the day of triumph when Christ was saluted with cries of "Hosanna!" and which, as some say, was first sung by Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles on the return from Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The stone.</span> This figure was generally understood to represent Messiah, on whom depended the existence and support of the kingdom of God. Many prophecies containing this metaphor were applied to him; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; so that the Pharisees could be at no loss to understand the allusion, seeing that Jesus claimed to be that Stone. <span class="cmt_word">Rejected;</span> as being not suitable to the building, or useless in its construction. So the husbandmen rejected the Son. The ignorance and contempt of men are overruled by the great Architect. <span class="cmt_word">The head of the corner.</span> The cornerstone, which stands at the base and binds together two principal walls (see St. Paul's grand words, <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). We learn that Christ unites Jew and Gentile in one holy house (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>). This (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>), being feminine, is thought by some to refer to "head of the corner" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but it is better to take it as used by a Hebrew idiom for the neuter, and to refer generally to what has preceded, viz. the settlement of the cornerstone in its destined position, which is effected by the Lord himself. The ultimate victory of the rejected Son is thus distinctly predicted (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>).

This may refer to the practice of executing the punishment of stoning by first hurling the culprit from a raised platform on to a rock or stone, and then stoning him to death. The falling on the stone has been explained in more ways than one. Some think that it implies coming to Christ in repentance and humility, with a contrite heart, which he will not despise. But the subject here is the punishment of the obdurate. Others take it to represent an attack made by the enemies of Christ, who shall demolish themselves by such onslaught. The original will hardly allow this interpretation. Doubtless the allusion is to those who found in Christ's low estate a stone of stumbling and rock of offence. These suffered grievous loss and danger even in this present time. The rejection of the doctrine of Christ crucified involves the loss of spiritual privileges, moral debility, and what is elsewhere called "the scattering abroad" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">On whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">it  will scatter him as chaff</span>). The persons here spoken of are not those who are offended at Christ's low estate; they are such as put themselves in active opposition to him and his kingdom; on them he will fall in terrible vengeance, and will utterly destroy them without hope of recovery. The idea is rerepeated from <a href="../../par/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34, 35</a>, and Daniel 2:44, 45. Christ in his humiliation is the Stone against which men fall; Christ in his glory and exaltation is the Stone which falls on them.

They could not fail, especially after ver. 43, to see the drift of the parables; their own consciences must have made them feel that they themselves were herein signified, their motives and conduct fully discovered.

A general disinclination or aversion is denoted; no actual outrage is perpetrated as yet, but the invited guests are ripening for this stage, in that they despise the King's Son, and believe not in his Divine mission. This backwardness and obduracy recall Christ's lamentation, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" (<a href="../../par/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34, 35</a>).

The bad are named first, in order to show the infinite graciousness of the king. In the earliest times converts were baptized with very little preparation and without any probation, as we see in the case of the eunuch, the jailor, and many more mentioned in the Acts; and doubtless many were insincere and soon lapsed. When we read of whole households being baptized, and in later times of whole nations receiving Christian initiation, there must have been little individual preparation of heart or cleansing of conscience, and the missioner had to take for granted much which more careful examination would have proved to be fallacious. The mention of this mixture of bad and good in the company introduces the final scene. <span class="cmt_word">The wedding.</span> The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other manuscripts read "marriage chamber" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king came in to see the guests,</span> who by this time had taken their appointed places at table. This second portion of the parable teaches that admission to the visible Church is not all that is required; there is also a scrutiny to be undergone and an award to be made. And that this investigation is keen and searching is denoted by the verb used, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which means not merely, to see casually, but to gaze upon with the intent of seeing the real nature and character of an object. The king makes his appearance in the banqueting hall, not to feast with the guests, but to welcome them, and to examine if they are properly ordered, served, and fitted for the high honour accorded to them. How close and personal is this inquiry is shown by the immediate detection of one unseemly guest among the multitude. The time when he thus comes is, in one view, the day of judgment; but such visitation and scrutiny are always recurring, as at solemn seasons, in days of trial, sacred services, holy communion, when he searches men's hearts, and sees if they are prepared for his presence. <span class="cmt_word">Which had not on a wedding garment;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">not garbed in wedding garment</span>, the genitive expressing the peculiar character or quality of the garment. Wordsworth compares similar phrases: <a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. It is said to have been an Oriental custom to present each guest invited to a royal feast with a festive robe to be worn on the occasion, as nowadays persons admitted to the royal presence are clothed with a caftan. Traces of the custom have been found in <a href="../../par/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-22.htm">2 Kings 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>; but they are not very convincing. The Romans seem to have had such a custom, the robes being called "cenatoria." Thus Martial, 10:87, 11, writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Pugnorum reus ebriaeque noctis,<br />Cenatoria mittat advocato."</span> But the fact remains that this guest had not presented himself in attire befitting the solemnity; in his everyday garb, and with  no proper preparation, he had dared to come to this great festival. What is the spiritual meaning of the wedding garment is much disputed. It is evidently some virtue, or quality, or mark which conditions admission to the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. On the one hand, it is said that both bad and good guests wear it, and its possession does not alter the character of the wearer. Dress is something external and visible, therefore the garment cannot represent an inward grace or feeling, but some outward token by which Christians are distinguished, such as open reception of baptism and sacraments, and public profession of the faith. On the other hand, it is contended that the whole matter is spiritual, though veiled in material forms, and is concerned with man's moral and spiritual nature. Hence it by no means follows that the wedding garment is not intended to have a spiritual signification. Ancient commentators universally look upon it in this light. Some regard it as an emblem of faith in Christ; others, of faith and love combined. "Habete fidem cum dilectione," writes St. Augustine, 'Serm.,' 90, "ista est vestis nuptialis." But it must be observed that faith of some sort was shown by accepting the invitation; so this could not be represented by the special garb which was absent. Others, again, see in it good works, or humility, or the purity effected by the grace of the Holy Spirit. Some moderns take it of "imputed," others of imparted, righteousness, bringing their controversies into the King's presence. chamber. The English Church, taking the marriage feast as a figure of the Holy Communion, applies the wedding garment to that cleansing of the conscience which enables persons to come holy and clean to that heavenly feast (see the first Exhortation to Holy Communion). This is legitimate, but too restricted in its reference. The feast denotes the present and future kingdom of God; the entrance to this is a matter of free grace; the garment is moral fitness, the life and conduct dependent on the due use of God's grace. This is in the power of all who have received the call; they have to act up to the high calling, to be wholly, heartily, really what they profess to be. The scrutiny, whether made in this life or in the life to come, shows how grace has been used, if we have put on Christ, if we have kept our soul pure and white, unsullied by sin, or washed clean by penitential tears and the blood of Christ (see <a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The metaphor concerning this robe of righteousness is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels." Commentators compare (but with doubtful appositeness) <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 8</a>.

Or, how couldst thou elude the vigilance of the servants, and enter in this unseemly garb? The former is doubtless the signification of the inquiry.

Applying the parable generally, Origen (<span class="accented">ap.</span> I.

In religious opinions they were mostly Sadducees. The Pharisees, on the other hand, in their nominal zeal for God, were violently opposed to the claims of Rome, and ready to rebel at the first favourable opportunity. They regarded the Herodians as little better than the heathen whom they favoured, but sunk their differences in the face of a general peril. Between these antagonistic elements an impious league had been formed earlier in Christ's ministry (see <a href="../../par/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Master</span>; <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, equivalent to "Rabbi;" owning him for the nonce as one possessed of teaching authority, though they willed not to be his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">True</span>; truthful.

Caesar at this time was Tiberius; the title was now applied to the emperors, though its subsequent use was different. By asking concerning the lawfulness of the payment, they do not inquire whether it was expedient or advisable to make it, but whether it was morally and religiously right, consistent with their obligation as subjects of the theocratic kingdom. Some, as Judas of Galilee (<a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:1: 1, 6), had resorted to violence in their opposition to the tax; and indeed, the question here put was much debated between opposite parties. The Pharisees were strongly opposed to foreign domination, and thought it derogatory and sacrilegious for the people of Jehovah to pay impost to a foreign and heathen authority. The Herodians, on the other hand, submitted without reserve to the supremacy  of Rome, and, for political reasons, silenced all nationalist and ultra-patriotic feeling. By putting this question, the disputants thought to force Christ into a dilemma, where he must answer directly "Yes" or "No," and where, whichever reply he made, he would equally offend one or other of the parties into which the state was divided. If he affirmed the lawfulness of the tax, he would lose his popularity with the mass of the people, as one who disowned the sovereignty of Jehovah, and would give the death blow to his own claims as Messiah-King. If he garb a negative reply, he would be deemed an enemy of Rome and a promoter of seditious views, and be liable to be handed over to the civil power for the punishment of disaffection and treason (see <a href="../../par/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>). They falsely brought this charge against him before Pilate (<a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>).

Christ's words proved in a moment that he saw through them, understood the meaning of the temptation to which they had subjected him - how they were trying to involve him in a political difficulty, from which they deemed no escape was possible. The character which they had fiatteringly. given to Jesus (ver. 16) he here fully responds to.

The reply to the question was wholly unexpected. The Pharisaic "disciples" had hoped that Christ would have taken part against the Herodians; but he gives no decision about the matter in dispute, such as they desired. He virtually rebukes their dissimulation, and makes their own action supply the verdict which they demanded. Not seeing the drift of his request, <span class="cmt_word">they brought unto him a penny;</span> <span class="accented">a denarius</span> (see on Matthew 18:28). This was the amount of the capitation tax, and it was paid in Roman, not Jewish, coinage. Just at this period the Jews had no mintage of their own, and were forced to use Roman coins, which might well be called "tribute money."

It must have borne a likeness of the emperor, and,therefore, as Edersheim remarks, must have been either a foreign one (Roman) or possibly one of the Tetrareh Philip, who on some of his coins introduced the image of Tiberius. The coins struck by the Romans in or for Palestine had, in accommodation to Jewish prejudices, no representation of any personage upon them. The Roman denarius at this date had on the obverse side the head of Tiberius, crowned with laurel leaves, and bore the legend, "TI CAESAR DIVI AVG FAVGVSTVS," and on the reverse, a seated female figure, with the inscription, "PONTIF MAXIM."

Rabbinism ruled that the right of coinage appertained to the ruler of a state, and was a proof of <span class="accented">de facto</span> government, which it was unlawful to resist. The current coin, which they used in their daily transactions, showed that the Jews were no longer independent, but set under and acquiescing in a foreign domination. Being subjects of Caesar, it was their duty to submit to his demands, and to pay the taxes which he had a right to levy. This was an answer to the insidious question propounded. Christ does not take either side in the controversy; he makes no question of the mutual rights of conquered and conquerors; he utters no aspiration for the recovery of independence; he uses facts as they are, and points to habitual practice as a sufficient solution of the difficulty. No reply could be wiser or simpler. Herein he gives a lesson for all time. No plea of religion can hold good against obedience to lawful authority. "Render to all their dues," says St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>): "tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour." <span class="cmt_word">The things that</span> <span class="cmt_word">are God's;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The things of God arc ourselves - our life, powers, faculties, means; to use these in God's service is our duty and our privilege. There need be no conflict between religion and politics, Church and state. Let a citizen do his duty to God, and he will find his obligations to the civil power are coincident and harmonious. Let the state respect the rights of God and of conscience, and there will he no collision between itself and the Church, but both will peaceably cooperate for the good of the community. Had the Jews rendered to God his dues, they would never have been reduced to their present state of subjection and debasement; would never have had to pay tribute to a foreign nation.

Their carefully laid plot, which had seemed so irresistible, was utterly frustrated. The view of the relations of Church and state set forth by Christ was novel and incomprehensible. Hitherto the two provinces had been considered identical.  The emperor, as we see impressed on his coins, was Pontifex Maximus; the Jewish priesthood had a political character, and the civil power was its instrument. In Christ's theory the spheres were distinct and not to be confounded. The state compelled obedience to its enactments; the Church left the conscience free, and obedience was voluntary and enforced by no external powers. The new society stood aloof from all political interests, and was responsible alone to God, while it performed its duties. <span class="cmt_word">Left him.</span> They had no answer to give.

The received reading historically describes the Sadducees' opinions; the other makes them come boldly stating their sentiments. Where authorities are pretty evenly balanced, we must decide the wording of a passage by other than literary considerations; and there can be no doubt that the reading which denotes the characteristic of the sect is more appropriate than that which represents them offensively parading their views as a preparation for the coming question. We have had notice of the Saddueees before (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>). The popular account of their religious belief is given in <a href="../../par/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>, "The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit." They were rationalists and sceptics, who denied many old-established truths, and scorned many prevalent observances. They acknowledged most of the Old Testament, though, curiously enough, they, like our modern neologians, stumbled at the supernatural upon which the Scriptures were built. Tradition and traditional interpretations found no favour with them. The future life of the soul they utterly repudiated, and the resurrection of the body, when it was brought before them, met with contemptuous ridicule. The claims and doctrine of Christ were, in their eyes, puerile and unworthy of philosophic consideration. At the same time, they recognized that the people were with him for the moment, and that it was expedient that his teaching, so utterly opposed to their own opinions, should be discredited and repressed. So they came forward asking an imaginary question, which, as they thought, would reduce to an absurdity the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the flesh. Doubtless they were members of the Sanhedrin, and it was at the instigation of this body that they proposed the presumed case of conscience.

This was a law not peculiar to the Hebrews, but prevalent from immemorial times among many ancient peoples, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Persians, Egyptians, and found in force among some nations in modern times, as Arabians, Druses, Cireassians, etc. It seems not to have been enforced in any case, but to have been left to the good will of the survivor, who might escape the obligation by submitting to a certain social obloquy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7-10</a>). The motive of the regulation was the maintenance of a family and the non-alienation of property. Many authorities assert that the law did not apply in the case of a man who left daughters (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>), but only in that of a childless widow. Later rabbinism limited the obligation to a betrothed woman, not yet actually married. But whatever may have been the limitations allowed in these days, the question of the Sadducees took its stand on the old legal basis, and endeavoured to draw therefrom a ridiculous inference. <span class="cmt_word">Shall marry;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb, found in the Septuagint, is used properly signifying "to take a woman to wife as the husband's kinsman" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and generally, "to contract affinity by marriage." <span class="cmt_word">Raise up seed.</span> The firstborn son of such a marriage was the legal heir of the deceased brother, and bore his name.

These disputants are treated with patience and calm argument, because they are not hypocrites like the Pharisees, but have the courage of their opinions, and do not seek to appear other than they are. They erred, said Christ, for two reasons: first, <span class="cmt_word">not knowing the Scriptures.</span> Whatever might be the lax opinions which they held respecting the prophets, there was no dispute about the supreme authority of the Pentateuch, and these Scriptures (as Christ proceeded to prove) plainly implied the doctrine of the resurrection.

Marriage is an earthly relationship, and can have no place in a spiritual condition. All that is of the earth, all that is carnal and gross, all human passions, all that is connected with sin and corruption, shall pass away. The risen life is no mere reproduction of the present, but a regeneration, new life added to the old, with new powers, acting under new laws, ranged in a new community. On earth men are mortal, and marriage is necessary to perpetuate the race; no such necessity obtains in the other life, where men are immortal. As an old Father says, "Where the law of death is abolished, the cause of birth is abolished likewise." <span class="cmt_word">Are as the angels of God in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the angels who dwell in heaven.

The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">angeli Dei in coelo.</span> Thus Christ, in opposition to the Saddueces' creed, admits the existence of angels. Glorified men are like the angels in these characteristics especially. They are immortal, no longer subject to human wants, passions, failings, or temptations; they serve God perfectly without weariness or distraction; they have no conflict between flesh and spirit, between the old nature and the new; their life is peaceful, harmonious, satisfying. Our Lord says nothing here concerning mutual recognition in the future state; nothing about the continuance of those tender relations which he sanctions and blesses on earth, and in the absence of which we cannot imagine perfect happiness existing. Analogy supplies some answer to such questions, but they are foreign to Christ's statement, and need not be here discussed.

They may have known the letter, they certainly knew nothing of the spirit of the Word of God, its depth and fulness. The key to the interpretation of the Scripture is faith. It is not enough to be acquainted with the literal signification; this is always inadequate, and denotes not the chief matter intended. To know the Scripture, in the sense of Christ, is to have a clear apprehension of its spiritual aspect, to feel and own the moral and mystical bearing of facts and statements, and to recognize that herein lies the real  significance of the inspired record. The want of this discernment vitiated the Sadducees' treatment and reception of Holy Writ, and involved them in lamentable error. Christ proceeds to demonstrate how the very Pentateuch (reverenced unquestionably by their party), which they deemed to be entirely silent on the subject of the life of the soul, spoke plainly on this matter to all who had faith to understand and appreciate the words of Divine wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">That which was spoken unto you by God.</span> To our minds Jesus might have adduced stronger arguments from other books of Scripture, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; but the Sadducees had drawn their objection from the Pentateuch, therefore from that section of the Bible he refutes them. To the books of Moses was always made the ultimate appeal in confirmation of doctrine; in the supreme authority of these writings all sects agreed. The utterances of the prophets were explained away as allegorical, poetical, and rhetorical; the plain, historical statements of the Law could not at that time be thus treated. Christ endorses unreservedly the Divine inspiration of the Pentateuch; he intimates that it was the voice of God to all time, and providentially directed to disperse such errors as those now produced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a></div><div class="verse">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

The quotation is from <a href="../../par/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, where God gives himself this name, as the Eternal, Self-existent One. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Abraham...Jacob.</span> These patriarchs had long been dead when this revelation was made; had they been annihilated, the Lord could not have called himself still their God. By this utterance he implied that he had still to do with them - had a blessing and a reward which they were to receive, and which they must be alive to enjoy. How can they who are his cease to exist? They who are in personal relation and covenant with God cannot perish. There were personal promises to Abraham, distinguished from those made to his seed (see <a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>, etc.), which were never fulfilled during his earthly life, and await realization in a future existence. God was the patriarchs' Father, Saviour, Redeemer, Judge, Rewarder; he could not hold these relations to mere dust and ashes, but only to con-scions and responsible beings, existing, though in another condition, and in another portion of God's creation. Thus was proved the continued existence and personality of the soul; and the resurrection of the body follows consequentially from this. Man is a complex being; he has body and soul, neither of which is complete without the other. The soul is not perfect man without the body, which is its organ; the body is not perfect man without the soul, which animates it. In giving eternal life to man, God gives it to the creature as originally made, not to one portion only of his nature. <span class="cmt_word">Of the living.</span> "For," as St. Luke adds, "all live unto him." The so called dead are alive in God's view; they have an abiding relation to him, live in his world, which comprises the seen and unseen, the present and the future. Titus St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>), "Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living."

The Sadducees, thus answered in the presence of the listening crowds, attempted no reply, slunk away confounded, utterly foiled in their hope of casting ridicule on the teaching of Christ. St. Luke notes that some scribes present, doubtless of the Pharisaic faction, were highly delighted with this public defeat of their adversaries, and cried, in enforced admiration, "Master, thou hast well said!"

The Pharisees were informed of, and some of them had witnessed, the discomfiture of the Sadducees (see <a href="../../par/luke/20-40.htm">Luke 20:40</a>); hence they deemed it necessary again to attack Jesus by asking a question which specially appertained to their own teaching. They felt that, if they were ever to compass his overthrow, they must first lower his credit with the people, so that these might no longer care to support or defend him. To succeed in entangling Jesus in a difficulty would not only effect this, but would also gain them a triumph over their adversaries, who had been so completely defeated. <span class="cmt_word">Were</span> <span class="cmt_word">gathered together;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>, Which may mean, "to the same place," as perhaps <a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>; or "on the same ground, for the same purpose."

Vulgate, <span class="accented">legis doctor</span>, which gives the right sense; for such were teachers and expounders of the Mosaic Law.

It is evident, from St. Mark's account, that Christ was pleased with him personally, for he said to him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Those who put this lawyer forward had, of course, sinister motives, and hoped to make capital from Christ's answer; but the man himself seems to have been straightforward and honest. We have had the terra "tempting" used in a hostile sense (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), but there is no necessity for so taking it; and it seems to imply here merely the renewal of the attack on Christ.

Which were of absolute obligation? which were not? The schools made a distinction between heavy and light commandments, as though some were of less importance than others, and might be neglected with impunity; and some of such exceeding dignity that fulfilment of them would condone imperfect obedience in the case of others. Some taught that if a man rightly selected some great precept to observe, he might safely disregard the rest of the Law (see <a href="../../par/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, etc.). This was the kind of doctrine against which St. James (<a href="../../par/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>) expostulates: "Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all." The Pharisees may have desired to discover whether Jesus knew and sanctioned these rabbinical distinctions. He had proved himself intimately acquainted with the inner meaning of Scripture, and able to evolve doctrines and to trace analogies which their dull minds had never comprehended; the question now was whether he entered into their subtle divisions and could decide this dispute for them. Such is the view usually taken of the scribe's question; but it may well be doubted, if regard is had to the character of the man, whether he had any intention of entangling Christ in these subtleties, but rather asked for a solution of the general problem - Of what nature was the precept which should be regarded as "first" (Mark) in the Law? We may compare the somewhat similar question and answer in <a href="../../par/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>. Lange's idea, that the scribe wished to force Christ to make some answer which, by implying his own claim to be Son of God, would trench upon the doctrine of monotheism, seems wholly unwarranted. This theory is based on the supposition that the Pharisee took it for granted that Jesus would answer, "Thou shalt love God above all," and intended to found upon that reply a condemnation for having made himself equal with God by his assertion of Sonship. But the text gives no countenance to such intention, and it has been suggested chiefly for the purpose of accounting for Christ's subsequent question (vers. 41-45), which, however, needs no such foundation, as we shall see. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, from the Septuagint, with some slight variation).

The expressions mean generally that God is to be loved with all our powers and faculties, and that nothing is to be preferred to him. It is difficult to define with any precision the signification of each term used, and much unprofitable labour has been expended in the endeavour to limit their exact sense. "Quum," as Grotius says, "vocum multarum cumulatio nihil quam intensius studium designet." It is usual to explain thus: <span class="accented">Heart</span>; which among the Hebrews was considered to be the seat of the understanding, is here considered as the home of the affections and the seat of the will. <span class="accented">Soul</span>; the living powers, the animal life. <span class="accented">Mind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, intellectual powers.

The Latins indicated this difference by <span class="accented">amo</span> and <span class="accented">diligo.</span> Our "neighbour" is every one with whom we are concerned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> virtually all men.

"This commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-21.htm">1 John 4:21</a>). And for the measure of our love to man, we have Christ's word in another place (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."

The clause is peculiar to St. Matthew. It signifies that on love of God and love of man depend all the moral and religious, ceremonial and judicial precepts contained in the Law, all the utterances of the prophets, all the voices of history. Scripture enunciates the duty to God and our neighbour, shows the right method of fulfilling it, warns against the breach of it, gives examples of punishment and reward consequent upon the way in which the obligation has been treated. Thus the unity and integrity of revelation is demonstrated. Its Author is one; its design is uniform; it teaches one path, leading to one great end.

The questioned becomes the questioner, and this with a great purpose. He had silenced his opponents, and opened profundities in Scripture hitherto unfathomed; he would now raise them to a higher theology; he would place before them a truth concerning the nature of the Messiah, which, if they received it, would lead them to accept him. It was as it were a last hope. He and the Pharisees had some common ground, which was wanting in the case of the Sadducees and Herodians (comp <a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>); he would use this to support a last appeal. Let us observe the Divine patience and tenderness of Christ. Not to gain a victory over inveterate enemies, not to expose the ignorance of scribe and Pharisee, not to exhibit his own profound knowledge of the inner harmonies of God's Word, does he now put this question. He desires to win acceptance of his claims by the unanswerable argument of the Scripture which they revered; let them consider the exact meaning of a text often quoted, let them weigh each word with reverent care, and they would see that the predicted Messiah was not merely Son of David according to earthly descent, but was Jehovah himself; and that when he claimed to be Son of God, when he asserted, "I and my Father are one," he was vindicating for himself only what the prophet had affirmed of the nature of the Christ. He had, so to speak, hope that some among his hearers would accept this teaching, and save themselves amid that untoward generation. It was when this last hope failed, when he saw nothing but hardened hearts and wilful prejudice, that he uttered the woes and predictions in the following chapter.

Christ proceeds to quote a passage from <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, acknowledged by the Jews to be Davidic and Messianic. Both these positions have been called in question in modern days, and sceptical critics have hence presumed to infer  ignorance or deceit on the part of Christ; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either that he did not know that the authorship was wrongly attributed to David, and that the psalm really referred to Maccabean times, or that, knowing these facts, he deliberately ignored them and endorsed a popular error in order to give colour to his argument. The statement of such a charge against our Lord is a sufficient refutation. Universal tradition, extending to this very time, which gave to the psalm a Messianic interpretation, is surely more worthy of credit than a theory elaborated in the present century, which in no respect regards the natural signification of the language, and can be made to support the novel idea only by forced and unreal accommodations. By speaking of David as having uttered the quoted words, Christ does not formally state that this king wrote the psalm; he merely gives the accepted view which classed it as Davidic. The authorship did not matter in his application; his argument was equally sound, whoever was the writer.

The quotation is from the Septuagint. But neither this nor our English Version is an adequate rendering of the original, where the word translated "Lord" is not the same in both parts of the clause, More accurately, the solemn beginning of the psalm is thus given: "Utterance [or, 'oracle'] of Jehovah to my Lord (<span class="accented">Adonai</span>)." The psalmist acknowledges the recipient of the utterance as his sovereign Lord; this could be no earthly potentate, for on earth he had no such superior; Jewish tradition always applied the term unto the Messiah, or the Word. The prediction repeats the promise made by Nathan to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>), which had no fulfilment in his natural progeny, and could be regarded as looking forward only to the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Sit thou on my right</span> <span class="cmt_word">hand.</span> Thus Messiah is exalted to the highest dignity in heaven. Sitting at God's right hand does not necessarily imply complete Divine majesty (as Hengstenberg remarks), for the sons of Zebedee had asked for such a position in Messiah's earthly kingdom (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-21.htm">Matthew 20:21</a>); but it denotes supreme honour, association in government, authority second only to that of Monarch. This is said of Christ in his human nature. He is "equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood."

How can Messiah be both Son and Lord of David? We, who have learned the truth concerning the two natures of Christ, can readily answer the question. He is both "the Root and the Offspring of David" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>). The Athanasian Creed offers the required solution of the seeming paradox: "God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the substance of his mother, born in the world; perfect God, and perfect Man...  who although he be God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ." Here was an explanation (if the Pharisees took his words to heart) of much that had excited their indignation, and caused cavil and carping. He claimed to be the Messiah; and Messiah, as Scripture presented him, had a twofold nature. When, therefore, he asserted equality with the Father when he, "being man, made himself God" (<a href="../../par/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>), he was vindicating that Divine nature which he as Messiah possessed. Jesus did not further elucidate this mystery. He had given food for reflection; he had unfolded the hidden meaning of Scripture; he had shown the shallowness of the popular exegesis; the knowledge was here; there was wanting only the will to raise the flower of faith in the heart of these obdurate hearers.

These weapons would be more successful in compassing the destruction of the innocent Victim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 23"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/23.htm"><title>Matthew 23 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/23.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/23.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/23-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/22.htm" title="Matthew 22">&#9668;</a> Matthew 23 <a href="../matthew/24.htm" title="Matthew 24">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-1.htm">Matthew 23:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-39.</span> - <span class="accented">Denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, and lamentation over Jerusalem which followed their guidance to her own destruction.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then spake Jesus</span>. Some small portion of this discourse, the close of our Lord's public teaching, is found in <a href="../../par/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38-40</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/20-45.htm">Luke 20:45-47</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/luke/11.htm">Luke 11, 13</a>.). It is here addressed to the multitude, and to his disciples, and seems to have been designed to comfort the former under the difficulty of having accredited teachers who were proved to have misunderstood Scripture, and were incapable of interpreting it aright. He willed to show how far they were to follow these instructors, and where it was necessary to draw a line beyond which they were not to be obeyed. Some modern critics have suggested that this discourse was not spoken at this time, but that St. Matthew has here collected into one body certain sayings of our Lord uttered at different times and places. It is far more natural to suppose that St. Matthew's statement of the occasion of this discourse is historically true, and that Christ here repeated some parts of the censure he had already, in the course of his ministry, found it necessary to pronounce. The unity of this utterance in form and essence, its logical sequence and climactic character, prove that it was delivered at one time, and was intended to form the Lord's farewell address to the wayward people who would not come unto him that they might have life. The discourse may be divided into three parts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The moral character of the scribes and Pharisees, and warning to Christ's disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.</span> In the seat of the great  judge and lawgiver. This is stated as an undoubted fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), with no idea of blame attached. Literally, <span class="accented">sat on the seat of Moses</span> from time immemorial. These (meaning not individuals, but the collective body) are the authorized expounders and teachers of the Law; their position is assured; they are not to be displaced. The scribes were the party chiefly denoted; they were of the Pharisaical sect; hence the addition, "and the Pharisees," by which is intimated, not that these latter, <span class="accented">qua</span> Pharisees, had any teaching office, but that the former shared their religious opinions. The Sadducees seem to have had no popular influence, and were never recognized as leaders. The Levitical priests never appear in the Gospels as teachers or expositors of the Mosaic system; this function of theirs had devolved upon scribes and lawyers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-3.htm">Matthew 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <i>that</i> observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All therefore.</span> It is because of their official authority as appointed teachers and expositors of the Law that Christ gives the following injunction. That observe and do. Many manuscripts and versions invert the order of the verbs, reading, <span class="accented">do and observe.</span> The received text seems most logical. <span class="accented">Observe</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, present imperative, continue to observe as a rule of conduct. <span class="accented">Do</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, aorist, do immediately, whenever the occasion arises. All that they taught or commanded out of the Law, or in due accordance therewith, was to be observed and obeyed. The statement is made in general terms, but was conditional and restricted by other considerations. It was only their official injunctions, derived immediately from Scripture, not their glosses, evasions, and interpretations, that were to be regarded with respect. The Lord had already taken occasion to warn against these errors (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6, 11, 12</a>, etc.). As inheritors of the authority of Moses, and speaking <span class="accented">ex cathedra</span>, they were so far worthy of respect. This principle laid down, Christ proceeds to denounce their evil practices. <span class="cmt_word">After their works.</span> You must distinguish between their preaching and their practice; the latter is to be shunned with all care. The scribes are never accused of corrupting the sacred text, which, indeed, was scrupulously guarded, and kept pure and unaltered. It was their treatment of the doctrines thereof that was censured. Our Lord shows their evil example in two particulars - their principle was "words, not deeds" (ver. 4), and ostentation in religion (vers. 5-7). <span class="cmt_word">They say, and do not.</span> They enunciated the Law, they enjoined obedience to it in the minutest particulars, and yet they themselves continually, in the most important points (ver. 23), infringed, neglected, evaded it. St. Paul, himself a strict Pharisee, denounces in stern language such inconsistent professors (<a href="../../par/romans/2-21.htm">Romans 2:21-23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay <i>them</i> on men's shoulders; but they <i>themselves</i> will not move them with one of their fingers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">importabilia</span> (Vulgate). The last epithet, which is very uncommon (<a href="../../par/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>), is omitted by some manuscripts and versions, but it is probably genuine here. The burdens are the minute regulations and prescriptions, the vexatious restrictions, the innumerable traditional observances with which these teachers had garbled and defaced the written Law. We have noticed some of these glosses in the matter of the sabbath and ceremonial purification; and these are only specimens of a system which extended to every relation of life, and to all details of religious practice, binding one rule to another, enforcing useless and absurd minutiae, till the burden became insupportable. Alford considers that not human traditions and observances are signified by the "burdens," but the severity of the Law, the weighty duties inculcated therein, which they enforce on others, but do not observe. It may, however, well be doubted whether Christ would ever have termed the legitimate rites and ceremonies of the Law unbearable burdens, though their rigorous enforcement by men who regarded only the letter, while they had lost the spirit, would naturally deserve censure. (If the epithet is not genuine, of course this remark does not apply.) What Christ denounced was not the Law itself, however severe and grievous to human nature, or even immemorial tradition, but the false inferences and deductions therefrom, leading to injunctions insupportable and impracticable. <span class="cmt_word">Will not move them with one of their fingers;</span> <span class="accented">with their finger.</span> This does not imply (and it would not be true) that the rabbis themselves were all hypocrites, and broke or evaded the Law with impunity. We know that they scrupulously attended to all outward observances. What is meant is that they take no trouble to lighten (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to move away"), to make these burdens easier by explanation or relaxation, or to proportion them to the strength of the disciple. They impose them with all their crushing weight and severity upon others, and uncompromisingly demand obedience to these unscriptural regulations, putting "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (<a href="../../par/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Contrast with this the Christian's service: "My yoke is easy," says Christ, "and my burden is light" (ch. 11:33). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to be seen of men.</span> The second bad principle in their religion was ostentation and vanity. Acts done professedly in the honour of God were animated  by self-seeking and ambition. They never penetrated beyond externalism. See this spirit reproved in the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). "They loved the glory of men more than the glory of God" (<a href="../../par/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>). Christ then gives proofs of this spirit of ostentation in religion and in private life. <span class="cmt_word">Phylacteries</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">preservatives</span>; equivalent to "amulets;" the translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, "prayer fillets." These were either strips of parchment or small cubes covered with leather, on or in which were written four sections of the Law, viz. <a href="../../par/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1-10, 11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>. They were worn fastened either to the forehead, or inside the left arm, so as to be near the heart. Their use arose from a literal and superstitious interpretation of <a href="../../par/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. Their dimensions were defined by rabbinical rules, but the extra pious formalists of the day set these at naught, and increased the breadth of the strips or of the bands by which they were fastened, in order to draw attention to their religiousness and their strict attention to the least observances of the Law. These phylacteries are still in use among the Jews. Thus in a 'Class Book for Jewish Youth' we read, "Every boy, three months before he attains the age of thirteen, commences to make use of the tephillin, which must be worn at least during the time of the morning prayers. The ordinance of the tephillin is one of the signs of the covenant existing between the Almighty and ourselves, that we may continually bear in mind the miracles God wrought for our forefathers." <span class="cmt_word">Enlarge the borders of their garments;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the fringes of their outer garments.</span> The best manuscripts have merely <span class="accented">their fringes.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">magnificant fimbrias.</span> These fringes or tassels (<span class="accented">zizith, zizijoth</span>) were fastened to the corners of the garments, in accordance with <a href="../../par/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>, and were composed of white and blue threads. They were intended to remind the wearers of the commandments of the Lord, and were regarded as peculiarly sacred (see <a href="../../par/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>). Christ condemns the ostentatious enlargement of these fringes as a badge of extraordinary piety and obedience. We quote again from the Jewish 'Class. Book:' "Every male of the Jewish nation must wear a garment [not usually an undergarment] made with four corners, having fringes fixed at each corner. These fringes are called <span class="accented">tsetsis</span>, or, memorial fringes. In the synagogue, during the morning prayers, a scarf with fringes attached to it is worn, which is called <span class="accented">tollece</span>, 'scarf or veil.' These memorial fringes typically point out the six hundred and thirteen precepts contained in the volume of the sacred Law. They are also intended to remind us of the goodness of the Almighty in having delivered our forefathers from the slavery in Egypt."

The custom of reclining on cushions set in horseshoe fashion at three sides of the table was now prevalent, the old custom of squatting round a low table, as at present practised in the East, having been long abandoned. The place of honour is said to have been at the upper end of the right side, the president being placed, not in the centre of that end of the table which faced the opening, but at the side. The most honoured guest would be at his right hand (but see on Matthew 26:23). There was often much manoeuvring to obtain this post, and many petty squabbles about precedence arose on every festal occasion (see <a href="../../par/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1, 7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The chief seats in the synagogues.</span> The usual arrangement of the synagogue is given by Dr. Edersheim ('Life and Times of Jesus,' 1. pp. 434, etc.). It was built of stone, with an entrance generally on the south, and so arranged that the worshippers might direct their prayers towards Jerusalem. In the centre was placed the lectern of the reader; the women's gallery was at the north end. "The inside plan is generally that of two double colonnades, which seem to have formed the body of the synagogue, the aisles east and west being probably used as passages. At the south end, facing north, is a movable ark, containing the sacred rolls of the Law and the prophets. Right before the ark, and facing the people, are the seats of honour, for the rulers of the synagogue and the honourable." These were the places for which the Pharisees contended, thinking more of gaining these, where they could sit enthroned in the sight of the congregation, than of the Divine worship which nominally they came to offer (comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2, 3</a>).

Christ himself was thus addressed by those who desired to denote his authority and preeminence (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16, 24, 36</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>).

The pronoun is emphatic, "But ye, be not ye called." They are not to be eager for such distinctions, indicative of spiritual superiority. The prohibition must be understood in the spirit, and not in the letter (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). Our Lord does not forbid respect for teachers or different grades in his Church (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>); that which he censures is the inordinate grasping at such personal distinctions, the greedy ambition which loves the empty title, and takes any means to obtain it. <span class="cmt_word">One is your Master, even Christ.</span> The received text gives <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.

Both these variations seem reasonable and warranted. "Leader" has probably been introduced from ver. 10, where it occurs naturally; it is out of place here, where, for the sake of concinnity, "Teacher" is required in both parts of the sentence. And it is unlikely that Jesus should here expressly mention himself. He is speaking now of their heavenly Father; to himself he refers in ver. 10. In support of the allusion to the Father, Bengel cites <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, etc. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Unus est enim Magister vester</span>; and yet Roman Catholic commentators interpret the clause of Christ, in spite of the purposed indefiniteness of the expression. Jesus points to the inspiration of the Father or the Holy Spirit as that which teaches his disciples. They were to follow no earthly rabbi, but the heavenly Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">All ye are brethren.</span> And therefore, so far, equal.

The antithesis certainly requires it. The gnome, so often repeated (see references), seems to be, as it has been called, "an axiom in the kingdom of God." It is indeed a universal law in God's dealings with men. Olshausen quotes a saying! of Hillel to the same purport, "My humility is my exaltation, and my exaltation is my humility." The first clause was prophetic of the speedy overthrow of the haughty Pharisees; the second is grandly illustrated in the example of Christ, who humbled himself to the death of the cross, and is now highly exalted; who "for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). St. Peter draws the lesson, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5, 6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a></div><div class="verse">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in <i>yourselves</i>, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-32.</span> - <span class="accented">Eight woes pronounced on the Pharisees for their conduct and teaching.</span> (Comp. <a href="../../par/luke/11-42.htm">Luke 11:42-52</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Some authorities transpose vers. 13 and 14 - a variation attributable to the circumstance that the commencing clauses are the same. As Christ inaugurated his public teaching by pronouncing eight benedictions in the sermon on the mount, so here he closes his ministry by imprecating or prophesying eight woes on the perverse and unbelieving Pharisees. In Lange's commentary there is proposed a scheme of antithesis between the  benedictions and the woes, but it is not very successful, being often forced and unnatural; and it is better to regard the contrast in a general view, and not to attempt to press it in particulars. Jesus here pours forth his righteous anger on those whose obstinate infidelity was about to bring ruin on the Jewish city and nation. <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto you!</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). These terrible "woes" are not only evoked by indignation, and pronounced as a solemn judgment, they are also expressive of the profoundest pity, and are prophetic of the future. They have, indeed, a twofold reference - they refer first to temporal judgments and visitations, now ready to fall; and secondly to the retribution in the eternal world. That the meek and lowly Jesus should utter such awful denunciations shows how greatly he was moved how he left nothing untried to turn these hard hearts to introspection and repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Scribes</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Pharisees</span> (see on ver. 2), <span class="cmt_word">hypocrites</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>). Christ uses this word seven times in these denunciations. It is applied to the Pharisees as deceiving themselves and others, under the mask of godliness hiding polluted hearts, persuading themselves that formal externalism was real piety and devotion, and practically teaching this fatal delusion. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">before men</span>; <span class="accented">ante homines</span> (Vulgate.

If any showed signs of yielding to honest conviction, they sternly forbade them to proceed; they repelled them with violence, as by excommunication (<a href="../../par/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22, 34</a>), or by calumniating the Teacher (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>, etc.). There was many a time when 34, people were ready to acknowledge Christ and to follow him as Messiah. A word from their authorized leaders would have turned the scale in his favour; but that word was never spoken. The weight of authority was always placed on the opposite side, and naught but prejudice, animosity, and slander befell the cause of Jesus.

To these they attach themselves, winning them over by flattery and fraud, and persuading them to assist them with their substance to the ruin of their fortunes.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Septuagint to signify "a stranger" or "sojourner" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>, etc.), and at this time was applied to a convert to Judaism (<a href="../../par/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>), whether circumcised, "a proselyte of righteousness;" or uncircumcised, "a proselyte of the gate." To <span class="accented">compass sea and land</span> is a proverbial expression, denoting the employment of every means, the exercise of the utmost effort. One might have thought that, in its proud isolation and exclusiveness, Judaism would not have exposed itself to this reproach. But what says Josephus? In more than one passage of his histories he testifies to the zealous propagation of the  Jewish religion, and in some cases the enforcement of circumcision on vanquished enemies (see 'Ant.,' 18:03. 5; 20:2. 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 10; 'Vita,' &sect; 23). Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:5) gives a most unfavourable account of the numerous converts which Hebrews made throughout the Roman provinces; and St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 6:11) quotes Seneca saying, "Cum interim usque eo sceleratissimae gentis consuetudo convaluit, ut per omnes jam terras recepta sit, victi victoribus leges dederunt" (Edersheim). For similar testimony, we may refer to Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:4. 142, 143; and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:541, etc. But it was not proselytizing in itself that the Lord censured. As possessing revelation and the only true religion in the world, the Jews might well have deemed it their business to enlighten the gross darkness of heathenism, and to endeavour to shed abroad the pure light which was confided to their care to tend and cherish. That they were not expressly commanded to do this, and that little blessing attended their efforts in this direction, was dependent upon the transitory and imperfect character of the old covenant, and the many evils which would be consequent upon association with alien peoples. In making converts, the Pharisees sought rather to secure outward conformity than inward piety, change of external religion than change of heart. There was no love of souls, no burning zeal for the honour of God, in their proselytism. They were prompted only by selfish and base motives - vain glory, party spirit, covetousness; and if they converted men to their own opinions, with their false tenets, gross externalism, and practical immorality, they had far better have left them in their irresponsible ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">When he is made;</span> <span class="accented">when he is become</span> a proselyte. <span class="cmt_word">Twofold more the child of hell;</span> <span class="accented">a son of Gehenna</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthy of hell fire.

The converts became doubly the children of hell because, seeing the iniquities of their teachers, they learned an evil lesson from them, "engrafted the vices of the Jews on the vices of the heathen," distrusted all goodness, discarded their old religion and disbelieved the new, making utter shipwreck of their moral life. "Ita natura comparati sumus," says an old commentator, "ut vitia potius quam virtutes imitemur, et in rebus malis a discipulis magistri facile superentur."

They were by profession leaders and guides, and yet by their literalism and externalism they lost the true significance of the Scriptures which they taught, and the ritual of which they were the exponents. The Lord repeats the epithet "blind "(vers. 17, 19, 24). <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing.</span> Our Lord seems to refer more especially to oaths connected with vows, of which he had already spoken (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-5.htm">Matthew 15:5, 6</a>). The arbitrary distinction between oaths was indeed an instance of moral blindness. An oath by the temple was not binding; it might be broken or evaded with impunity. <span class="cmt_word">By the gold of the temple -</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the sacred treasure and ornaments therein - <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); he is bound by his oath. The casuistry employed by the Jews in this matter was well known, and had become proverbial among the heathen. F.M. quotes Martial, 11:94 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Ecce negas, jurasque mihi per templa Tonantis,<br />Non credo: jura, verpe, per Anchialum.'"</span> Anchialum is equivalent to <span class="accented">am chai aloh</span>, "as God liveth," the Jew (<span class="accented">verpus</span>, "circumcised") being bound by no oath but one that contained some letters of the Divine name or some attribute of God.

It was because the temple was the place of God's presence that what was therein was consecrated. The gold was nothing without the temple; the temple, the originally holy, is superior to the gold, the derivatively holy, and an oath that calls the temple to witness is surely obligatory.

Others see here the principle that the validity of oaths was differentiated by the nearness to the Person of God of the things by which they were taken. This, too, opened up large opportunities of evasion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-19.htm">Matthew 23:19</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Ye</i> fools and blind: for whether <i>is</i> greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Our Lord repeats the unanswerable argument of ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">That sanctifieth the gift.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>.

The oath by the altar involves the notion of the victim as well as the altar; one cannot be separated from the other; and, of course, implies him to whom the offering is made.

From such passages we learn that God sanctifies things and places to be devoted to his service, and to be accounted by men holy and separated from all common uses. The Authorized Version translates the received text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which has good authority, the past participle being, perhaps, a correction by some scribe who thought that the day of Judaism was past when Christ spoke.

Christ again dissipates such sophistries. To swear by the creature is virtually to swear by the Creator. A brute, inanimate thing cannot be witness to an oath; he alone can be appealed to who owns all. Thus we "kiss the book," calling God to witness our words. Christ had already given a lesson to his followers on this subject in the sermon on the mount (ch. Matthew 5:34-37). He inculcates true reverence, that fear and awe of God's dignity and God's presence which constrains a man to avoid all profaneness and carelessness in regard to things that are concerned with God.

"Mint" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Of this well known plant several species grow in Palestine; it was one of the ingredients of the sauce of bitter herbs eaten at the Paschal feast (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), and was hung up in the synagogue for its fragrance. "Anise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is known to us as "dill," and is much used in medicine and for seasoning.

Christ seems to refer to the words of <a href="../../par/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (see also <a href="../../par/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9, 10</a>). Worthless are all outward observances when the moral precepts are neglected. "Judgment" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means acting equitably to one's neighbour, hurting nobody by word or deed; as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a> a man is sought "that exerciseth justice.'" Such impartiality is specially enjoined in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, etc.). "Mercy," loving kindness in conduct, often taught in the Pentateuch, as in the case of the widow, the stranger, and the debtor, and very different from the feeling of those who "devour widows' houses." "Faith" may mean fidelity to promises: "He that sweareth unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance" (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>); but it is more probably taken as that belief in God without which it is not possible to please him, and which should underlie and influence all moral action (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)...  <span class="cmt_word">the other</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). "These last" are judgment, mercy, and faith; these it was your duty to have done. "The other" refers to the tithing mentioned above. Christ does not censure this attention to minutiae. He would teach conformity to regulations made by competent authority, or conscientiously felt to be binding, even though not distinctly enjoined in Scripture (see vers. 2, 3); his blame is reserved for that expenditure of zeal on trifles which stood in the place of, or left no strength for, higher duties.

Thus Revised Version, and early English versions, <span class="accented">which strain out the gnat</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">excolantes culicem.</span> Alford thinks the present reading was an intentional alteration, meaning "strain (out the wine) at (the occurrence of) a gnat" - which seems more ingenious than probable. If "at" be retained, it  must be taken as expressive of the fastidiousness which had to make a strong effort to overcome its distaste at this little insect. The wine, before drinking, was carefully strained through linen (see <a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, "strained wine," Septuagint) to avoid the accidental violation of <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20, 23</a>, etc.; Leviticus 17:10-14, by swallowing an unclean insect. The practice, which was in some sense a religious act, is found among the Buddhists in Hindostan and Ceylon, either to avoid pollution or to obviate the danger of taking life, which their code forbids. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>camel</span>. The gnat and the camel, which were alike unclean, stand at the extremities of the scale of comparative size. Our Lord uses a proverbial expression to denote the inconsistency which would avoid the smallest ceremonial defilement, but would take no account of the gravest moral pollution.

But the Pharisees' motives in acting thus were not pure; they were not influenced by respect for the prophets or repentance for national sins, but by pride, hypocrisy, and self-sufficiency.

Commentators quote the old adage, herein exemplified, "Sit licet divus, dummodo non vivus."

The passage in the Second (Fourth) Book of Esdras 1:32, which is strikingly parallel to our Lord's denunciation, may possibly be a Christian interpolation, "I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a></div><div class="verse">That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That upon you may come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>). This phrase does not express a simple consequence, neither can it mean "in such a way that" - explanations which have been given by some commentators to avoid a seeming difficulty in the final sense; but it is to be translated, as usually, <span class="accented">in order that, ut veniat.</span> God, foreseeing the issues of their evil heart, puts in their way occasions which will aid his vengeance and accelerate the time of their punishment. He lets them work out their own destruction by committing an unpardonable sin. He does not force them into this course of conduct; they can resist the opportunity if they will; but he knows they will not do so, and the  visitation becomes judgment. To have a man's blood upon one's head is to be held guilty of the crime of murder, and to be liable to make the required atonement for it. So in their blind fury, taking the punishment on themselves, the Jews a little later cried, "His blood been us, and on our children!" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteous blood</span>. So in the Old Testament we often find such expressions as "innocent blood" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>); "blood of the just" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a>); comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> and Revelation 18:24, where it is written that in Babylon "was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all them that were slain upon the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Righteous Abel.</span> The first of the murdered, the prototype of the death of Christ and of all good men who have died for truth, religion, and justice (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>). The catalogue of such is long and terrible. Our Lord assigns a period to its dimensions, commencing with the first death mentioned in the Bible, and ending with the murder of <span class="cmt_word">Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">the sanctuary</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and the altar.</span> Our Lord is speaking of a past event well known to his hearers; but who this Zacharias was is much disputed. Origen mentions a tradition, otherwise entirely unsupported, that Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, was the son of Barachiah, and was murdered in the temple. But the story looks as if it was made to relieve the difficulty of identification; neither, as far as we know, was he a prophet. Zechariah, the minor prophet, was the son of Berechiah; but we read nothing of his being slain in the temple or elsewhere. It is true that Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:05. 4) tells how a "Zacharias, son of Baruch," an honourable man, was slain by the zealots in the temple. But this murder took place A.D. , and our Lord could not number it among past crimes, or speak of it as an event familiar to those who heard him. The only other prophet of this name in the Bible is one mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>, as stoned by the people at the command of Joash, in the court of the house of the Lord. "And when he died," it is added, "he said, The Lord look upon it, and require it." This makes his case correspond to that of Abel, the voice of whose blood cried unto God from the ground. He is also the last prophet whose death is recorded in the Old Testament, and the guilt of whose murder, the Jews say, was not purged till the temple was burned under Nebuchadnezzar. It seems to be a kind of proverbial saying which the Lord here uses, equivalent to "from the first murdered saint to the last," taking the arrangement of the Hebrew canon of Scripture, and regarding the Books of Chronicles as the conclusion of Jewish history. This (though it would exclude the murder of other prophets, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) would all be plain enough and quite appropriate to the context were it not that the Zechariah thus referred to was the son of Jehoiada, not of Barachias. But there are two solutions of this difficulty suggested; and, allowing either of these, we may confidently assert that the above-named prophet is the personage intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The words, "son of Barachias" may be an early interpolation, introduced by a copyist who was thinking of the minor prophet. They are omitted by the first correcter of the Sinaitic Manuscript, are not found in the parallel passage of St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>), and Jerome remarks that in the 'Gospel of the Nazarenes' was read "son of Joiada." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There may have been family reasons, unknown to us, why Zechariah was thus designated (see the commentators on our Lord's genealogy in St. <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, especially on ver. 23, "son of Hell," ver. 27, "son of Salathiel," and ver. 36, "son of Cainan"). Or Jehoiada may have had two names, as so many Jews had. Indeed, the two appellations are not altogether dissimilar in meaning, <span class="accented">Jehoiada</span> signifying "Jehovah knoweth," and <span class="accented">Barachiah</span>, "Jehovah blesseth." Or again, Barachiah may have been the father of Zechariah, and Jehoiada the more famous grandfather. It has been suggested (by Morison, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that one of the monuments recently erected in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem was dedicated to Zacharias. Such a one still bears his name. Hence Christ's allusion is very natural after his statement in ver. 29. The scene of the murder was the open space in the priests' court, between the holy place and the great altar of sacrifice. The sanctity of this spot made the crime abnormally atrocious.

The blood of the past was required from the Jews of the present time, because they and their evil ancestors were of one family, and were to be dealt with as a whole. In spite of the teaching of history and example, in spite of the warnings of Christ and his apostles, they were bent on repeating the acts of their forefathers, and that in an aggravated form and against increased light and knowledge.

The time intended is that when Israel shall repent of its rejection of the Messiah, and in bitter contrition look on him whom it pierced, owning and receiving Jesus with glad "Hosannahs!" Then shall they behold him coming in power and glory, and shall regain their old position as beloved of God (see <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). Then "all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>).

There is no reason to think, with Olshauson, that St. Matthew or his editor has considerably amplified the original discourse of our Lord by introducing details and expressions from other quarters. The discourse, as we now have it (ch. 24. and 25.), forms a distinct whole, divided into certain portions closely related to each other and it would have been unnatural in St. Matthew, and opposed to his simple and veracious style, to have put words into our Lord's mouth at this moment, which were not actually uttered by him on this solemn occasion. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="accented">Occasion of the discourse.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/13-1.htm">Mark 13:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5-7</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the temple;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">went out from the temple, and was going on his way</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). So the best manuscripts and versions. It was while he was proceeding on the route to Bethany that the disciples interrupted him with their remarks about the temple. He had now taken his final leave of the hallowed courts; the prophecy of the desolation of the house was beginning to be fulfilled (see on Matthew 23:38). <span class="cmt_word">His disciples came to him.</span> They were disquieted by Christ's words recorded at the end of the last chapter, which spoke of a terrible retribution about to fall, of the desolation of the temple, of Christ's own departure for a time. St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>) tells us that Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately when these things should be, and what signs should forewarn of their approach, as in ver. 3.

They had gathered from his words that destruction awaited this edifice, but as they gazed upon it they could scarcely bring themselves to believe in its coming overthrow. So as they gained some commanding point of view, they drew Christ's attention to its beauty, magnificence, and unequalled solidity, desiring him to explain further the mode and time of the catastrophe. It was popularly said, "He who never saw the temple of Herod has never seen a fine building." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said</span>.

Recent explorations have shown that not a stone of Herod's temple remains <span class="accented">in situ.</span> The orders of Titus, given with regret, for the total demolition of the walls of temple and city, were carried out with cruel exactness, so that, as Josephus testifies ('Bell. Jud.,' 7:01. 1), passers by would not have supposed that the place had ever been inhabited. When the apostate Julian, in the fourth Christian century, endeavoured to cast a slur upon prophecy by rebuilding the city and temple, his design proved to be an ignominious failure, and the sacred shrine has continued to this day a monument of Divine vengeance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a></div><div class="verse">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what <i>shall be</i> the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - As he eat upon the Mount of Olives. On his way to Bethany towards the close of this day, he rested for a while and communed with the disciples, uttering the wonderful eschatological discourse which follows in this and the next chapter. It is noted that the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans began on the very spot where this prophecy of its destruction was delivered, strategical reasons compelling them to make their attack from this quarter. "A sudden turn in the road," writes Dr. Edersheim (2:431), "and the sacred building was once more in full view. Just then the western sun was pouring his golden beams on tops of marble cloisters and on the terraced courts, and glittering on the golden spikes on the roof of the holy place. In the setting, even more than in the rising sun, must the vast proportions, the symmetry, and the sparkling sheen of this mass of snowy marble and gold have stood out gloriously. And across the black valley, and up the slopes of Olivet, lay the dark shadows of those gigantic walls built of massive stones, some of them nearly twenty-four feet long. Even the rabbis, despite their hatred of Herod, grow enthusiastic, and dream that the very temple walls would have been covered with gold had not the variegated marble, resembling the waves of the sea, seemed more beauteous. It was probably, as they [the disciples] now gazed on all this grandeur and strength, that they broke the silence imposed on them by gloomy thoughts of the near desolateness of that house which the Lord predicted." <span class="cmt_word">Privately</span>.  Such questions were not to be asked openly in the hearing of any who might have followed him from the city. There was nothing more resented by the average Jew than any intimation of the destruction of the temple. It was one of the charges against Stephen that he had said that Jesus would destroy the temple (<a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). When, therefore, some of the apostles wished for more definite information on this subject, they took care to make their inquiry in private. Their questions were twofold - they desired to know the time of the events, and the signs which should precede Christ's coming and the end of the world. <span class="cmt_word">When shall these things be?</span> "These things" refer to the destruction of the temple, and the course of events which, as they conceive, are dependent thereupon (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>). To their minds, this catastrophe could only occur contemporaneously with the coming of Christ in glory and the end of the world. They saw in it a great revolution which should usher in the final consummation. But when should this come to pass? - in their own day, or after many ages? in the lifetime of this generation, or at some far-distant period? It was not mere wanton curiosity to know the future which prompted the question, but rather a reverent desire to prepare for these great events, of the certainty of which they were now fully assured. So the next question shows no doubt concerning the facts, and asks, not the mode of the accomplishment, but only what anticipatory warning and indication were to be given. <span class="cmt_word">Sign of thy coming</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and of the end of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). They look upon these two events as synchronous, or very closely connected. The word <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which in classical Greek means "presence," or "arrival," is used in the New Testament specially for the second advent of Christ to set up his eternal kingdom in full power and glory (see in this chapter vers. 27, 37, 39; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, etc.). Referring to the same event, we find in some places the term "epiphany" used (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>), and in others "revelation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>); but the three expressions denote simply the open establishment of Messiah's kingdom, indefnitely as to time and manner. The phrase translated "the end of the world "means literally <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>); <span class="accented">consummationis saeculi</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the close of this present seen, in contradistinction from the future aeon, or the world to come. This is "the last time," "the last days," spoken of elsewhere (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-41.</span> - <span class="accented">The first portion of the great prophecy.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said.</span> The succeeding prophecy has much exercised the minds of commentators from the earliest times unto the present. It is, indeed, full of mysteries, dark sayings, profundities, which our minds cannot fathom. Many of these are and must be inherent in the subject; but some difficulties have been created by the imperfect views taken by those who have applied themselves to explain the Lord's utterances. It is seen by all that we have here predictions concerning the fate of Jerusalem, concerning the parousia of Christ, and concerning the last times; it is the attempt to assign to these events separately certain definite portions of the address that has led to confusion and perplexity. Over-refinement and over-wisdom have marred the exposition of many critics. They have limited to one event that which was spoken of more than that one; confining their view to one point, they have excluded other points which were equally in the mind of the Revealer. It has been usual to divide the prophecy in this chapter into two sections, of which the first, extending to the twenty-ninth verse, is supposed to relate to the fate of Jerusalem itself; the second, comprising the rest of the chapter, to the parousia and the coming to judgment. But such definite partition will not stand investigation, and can be maintained only by doing violence to language or ignoring more natural explanations. The prophecy announces analogous events, the description of which has more than one application, and often passes from one to another with nothing to closely mark the transition. The combination of facts thus woven together cannot be coarsely unravelled. The same words, the same expressions, are used to denote the arrival or fulfilment of distinct occurrences. To limit these to one event only is to set bounds to the Omniscient. So it seems to be not only most expedient, but most reverent, to look on our Lord's eschatological address as one whole, of which the several parts are in full harmony and sequence (if we were only able to understand them), and to acknowledge that insuperable difficulties in the interpretation do exist and are meant to exist. The Lord had to prepare his followers for the overthrow of their city, and the dangers to life and faith which would accompany that judgment. He desired also to raise in them a constant expectation of his advent, so that Christians then and thenceforward might ever live in hope and watch for a great future. Herein will be found the key to the perplexities of the address; not that even this  unlocks all the mysteries, but, it opens the drift of these wonderful utterances, and enables us to see light amid the gloom. This will appear more fully as we examine the details. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed that no man deceive you;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>: <span class="accented">lead you astray</span> (so ver. 5). Jesus does not answer the disciples' question as to the time when "these things" shall occur; that is purposely left uncertain. He proceeds to warn them against the dangers which would beset them in the coming crisis. He withdraws them from the speculative to the practical (see vers. 23-25). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5</a></div><div class="verse">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Here begins what has been called the first strophe of the oracle (vers. 5-14), which indicates certain prognostics common to the close of the Jewish theocracy and to the end of the world. <span class="cmt_word">Many shall come in my Name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), resting on my Name, grounding their pretensions thereon. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, I am Christ</span> (<span class="accented">the Christ</span>). They who really desired to follow Christ should be tried by the temptation to see in other persons the Messiah. The warning could scarcely have been needed by the apostles themselves; it must have been meant primarily for their converts and the early Christians. And though we have no account in apostolic Church history of any such pretenders, yet in the age succeeding our Lord's death we read of many impostors who asserted themselves to be inspired prophets, if not the Messiah, and led astray many credulous persons (see Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:05. 1; 8. 6, etc.). There were doubtless many false Messiahs whose names are little known, and critics have enumerated twenty-nine such. The pretensions of these persons were not generally admitted, and their adherents were commonly few and uninfluential. Our Lord probably did not allude to these in his monition. But we may observe that the warning may include such deceivers as Simon Magus and those many false teachers who vexed the early Church, and, without assuming the name of Christ, did Satan's work by undermining the faith. St. John speaks of there being "many antichrists" in his day (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>), and St. Paul had occasion to warn his converts against "heretical seducers" (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>, etc.). Since then the prophecy has been fulfilled in the heretics who, professing to come in the Name of Christ and to enunciate his doctrine, or, like Mohammed, to assume his place, have taught lies. These shall abound in the latter days, and shall be a sign of the approaching end.

The peace which reigned at Christ's birth was rudely shattered after his death, though the wars before the destruction of Jerusalem were of no great importance. We hear of an in. tended expedition against Aretas (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:05. 3), of one of Caligula against the Jews (ibid., 18:8. 2), both of which, however, came to nothing. Then there were certain insurrections in the reigns of Claudius (ibid., 20:5, 3) and Nero (ibid., 20:8. 6-10). The Roman empire was disturbed; four emperors - Nero, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius - died by violence within a short space of time; the restless Parthians were a continual source of trouble. But these and such-like occurrences do little to exhaust the meaning of Christ's prediction. He is looking forward to a distant future, and sees with prophetic eye the state of warfare which has prevailed from the disruption of the Roman empire, and which shall continue unto the end. <span class="cmt_word">See that ye be not troubled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">see, be ye</span> <span class="accented">not troubled</span>, Look on it all, and yet be not affrighted. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> these things (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">must come to pass.</span> All that I announce is sure to occur, not from any absolute necessity, but because of men's passions and perverseness, which will bring it to pass (see on Matthew 18:7; and <a href="../../par/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The end is not yet.</span> These signs might lead men to think that the final consummation was close at hand.

Jud.,' 2:17. 10; 18:1-8; 4:3. 2; and by Philo, 'Legat. ad Caium,' &sect; 30) could hardly have been indicated in such grand terms. More to the purpose is the sketch of the period given by Tacitus, at the opening of his history, though it embraces also details belonging to a somewhat later age: "I enter upon a work fertile in vicissitudes, stained with the blood of battles, embroiled with dissensions, horrible even in the intervals of peace. Four princes slain by the sword; three civil wars, more with foreign enemies, and sometimes both at once; prosperity in the East, disasters in the West; Illyricum disturbed; the Gauls  ready to revolt; Britain conquered, and again lost; Sarmatians end Suevians conspiring against us; the Dacians renowned for defeats given and sustained; the Parthians almost aroused to arms by a counterfeit Nero. Italy afflicted with calamities unheard of, or recurring only after a long interval; cities overwhelmed or swallowed up in the fertile region of Campania; Rome itself laid waste by fire, the most ancient temples destroyed, the very capitol burned by its own citizens," etc. ('Hist.,' I. 2). But the Lord's words seem to refer to times when Rome's dominion had ceased, and nation warred against nation, as in later and modern days in Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa So again the prediction must be extended far beyond events in the Jewish cycle. <span class="cmt_word">Famines</span>. Besides the famine mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>, there were others in Jerusalem and Judaea (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:15. 3; 20:2.6; 4. 2; 'Bell. Jud.,' yd. 3. 3). Suetonius ('Claud.,' 18) speaks of "assiduas sterilitates;" and Tacitus ('Ann.,' 12:43) records as happening at the same period, "frugum egestas, et orta ex eo fames." <span class="cmt_word">And pestilences;</span> as consequent on famine. Hence the Greek paronomasia, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, in our text. But many editors expunge <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, considering it, with some reason, to have been introduced from the parallel passage in St. Luke, where it is certainly genuine. Of pestilences we have notice in Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:06, 1), in Tacitus ('Ann.,' 14:16), and Suetonius ('Nero,' 39), where we read that at Rome in a single autumn thirty thousand persons perished. Wordsworth refers to Tertullian ('Apol.,' 20.), Who sees in these predictions infallible proof of the inspiration of Scripture. "Hence it is that we come to be so certain of many things not yet come to pass, from the experience we have of those that are; because those were presignified by the same Spirit with these which we see fulfilling every day" (Reeve). <span class="cmt_word">Earthquakes</span>. Commentators relate the occurrence of such commotions at Rome, in Crete, Laodicea, Campania, etc., and at Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:04. 5; Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 12:43, 58; 14:27; 15:22; Seneca, 'Ep.,' 91. 9; Philostraius, 'Vit. Apollon.,' 4:34; Zonaras, 'Ann.,' 11:10). Nosgen takes the term "earthquakes" in a metaphorical sense as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, and implying mental perturbations; but it seems incongruous to admit a metaphysical prognostication in the midst of a notice of a series of material phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">In divers places;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">per loca</span> (Vulgate).

St. Paul writes (<a href="../../par/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>), "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." The tribulations and calamities which preceded and accompanied the overthrow of the Jewish polity are a sign and warning of the great and universal woes Which shall herald the day of judgment. Jewish writings speak of "the sorrows of Messiah," distresses, wars, famine, dissension, etc., which should herald his advent, and Christ may have used the popular opinion, true as far as it went, as a vehicle for conveying the further truth, that the coming age would be produced amid terrible agonies of men, peoples, and nature.

St Mark does not note the time; St. Luke writes, "before all these things." Hence we gather that the calamities now announced will precede, accompany, and follow those before mentioned. That which befell the apostles and early believers is an emblem of what Christianity will undergo at the hands of an antagonistic world. St. John, in the Revelation, has shadowed forth these things as doomed to fall upon the Church in the latter days. <span class="cmt_word">Shall they deliver you up to be afflicted</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17, 18</a>).

The Book of the Acts contains numerous examples of such afflictions (see <a href="../../par/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>: 14:19, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Kill.</span> As Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>), James the brother of John (<a href="../../par/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), Peter and Paul (Eusebius, 'Hist.

Tacitus speaks of those "quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Christianos appellabat" ('Ann.,' 15:44). The Romans seem to have placed Jews and Christians in the same category, and to have bestowed on the latter the hatred felt for the former. But the Lord's words point to some feeling more universal and permanent than this temporary animosity, even to the hatred which occasioned the death of martyrs in all ages, the warfare between  good end evil, faith and unbelief, which shall continue and increase in virulence unto the end (<a href="../../par/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>).

"First those were seized who confessed that they were Christians; and then on their information a vast multitude was convicted" ('Ann.,' 15:44). <span class="cmt_word">Shall hate one another.</span> Dissensions in religion cause the most bitter hatred, the very opposite of that love which is the essence of Christianity (<a href="../../par/john/15-17.htm">John 15:17</a>). Where one of a pagan family embraced Christianity, the convert was regarded as an outcast, and cut adrift from the nearest domestic ties. The same treatment obtains even now in India. The reference in the text chiefly concerns contentions among professing Christians; we see such effects every day; they appear in every page of ecclesiastical history; they have stained the annals of our own and every nation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a></div><div class="verse">And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">False prophets</span> (ver. 24). These were not necessarily predictors or soothsayers, but teachers having, as they said, a message from God. Such pretenders have arisen in every great crisis; but the Jews a few years later were deceived continually by fanatics or impostors, who professed to be inspired, and premised the infatuated people deliverance, urging them to resist the Romans, in expectation of the coming of Messiah to lead them to immediate victory (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 2). The designation "false prophets" applies also to those heretical teachers who vexed the peace of the early Church, and of whom St. John expressly speaks, "Many false prophets are gone out into the world" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>). These were Judaizing and Gnostic teachers, who tried to mar the good work of the apostles (see <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18-23</a>, etc.). Throughout the Christian ages heresiarchs have always raised their evil voices, and the history of the Church is very much composed of accounts of such teachers, and of the efforts made to suppress them and to correct their pernicious doctrines.

The troubles and persecutions that shall beset believers, the spirit of worldliness and self-seeking that a timid faith encourages, will issue in loosening dependence upon God and trust in his providential care; and internal dissensions will destroy that brotherly love which ought to be characteristic of Christians. Of this lack of energetic love the Lord speaks in his warnings to the Church of Laodicea (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>), "Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."

Here is a note of consolation amid the refrain of woe. Patience and perseverance shall be crowned at the last. "The end" means primarily the destruction of Jerusalem, and the salvation promised is safety in that day of peril. It is believed that no Christians perished in the siege or after it (see ver. 16). But <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, being here used without the article (differently from vers. 6 and, 14), must not be restricted to one allusion, but must be taken more generally, as indeed a universal axiom, equivalent to "finally," as long as endurance is needed. And the salvation must refer to the soul's sentence at the last day, not to any mere safety of body and life. What the maxim says is this: patient continuance in well doing, resignation under persecutions and afflictions, holding fast the one faith even though it lead to the martyr's death, - this shall win the crown of eternal blessedness. The Christian must not be led astray by false teachers nor offended by the prevalence of scandals, nor let his love be chilled, if he would gain the reward, share in Messiah's glory, and save his soul.

Before the taking of Jerusalem, the gospel had been carried into all parts of the then known world. We have very uncertain information about  the labours of most of the apostles, but if we may judge of their extent from what we know of St. Paul's, we should say that very few quarters of the Roman world were left unvisited. "Their sound went out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the inhabited world" (<a href="../../par/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>). St. Paul testifies that the gospel was preached to every kingdom under heaven (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 23</a>).

We know that there was no national conversion in the primitive era, however common individual conversion may have been. So in the present age we are not to expect more than that Christian missions shall reach the uttermost parts of the earth, and that all nations shall have the offer of salvation, before the final appearance of Christ. The success of these efforts at universal evangelization is a mournful problem. "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find the faith upon the earth?"

What is meant by the term in our text is a matter of unsettled dispute. The prophecy in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a> has been generally referred to the doings of Antiochus Epiphanes (see 1 Macc. 1:54), and the present is considered to relate to something analogous. "Abomination" in the Old Testament is generally connected with idolatry or sacrilege; "of desolation" is equivalent to "that causes desolation." Among the many explanation; of this passage which have been offered, two only seem worthy of consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The desolating abomination is referred to the Roman armies encamped around Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/luke/21-20.htm">Luke 21:20</a>), of which the symbol was the legionaries' eagles, regarded with reverence by the soldiers. But in opposition to this view it may be said, if the holy place, without the article, signifies the Holy Land, then the presence of the Latin forces would be no new sign to the Jewish people, as they had been familiar with such a sight for many years. If the temple itself is meant, it is plain that it would be too late to fly from that doomed city when the Roman eagles were already in the hallowed courts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The alternative interpretation, which has seemed to many more probable, explains it of the sanguinary deeds of the Zealots, who, after the war had been carried on for some years, seized the temple, put a stop to the daily sacrifice, deluged the sacred courts with blood, and were guilty of most hideous crimes and excesses, which, as Josephus testifies, were the immediate cause of the city's, ruin (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:03, 7, etc.; 5:1, 2; 6:3; 5:9, 4; 6:2; and Wordsworth's note on this ver. 15). The presence and acts of these ruffians were to be the signal for the escape of the Christians. I must confess that neither of these explanations satisfies me. The primal fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy is found in the erection of the statue of Jupiter in the temple by the order of Antiochus Epiphanes, and the pollution of the altar by the sacrifice of swine thereon. Our Lord would seem to refer to something analogous which should give the Christians a signal for escape before the complete investiture of the city. The deeds of Zealots and assassins, however atrocious, could not with any propriety be described as "abomination that maketh desolate standing in the holy place." The term, according to scriptural analogy, must refer to some sacrilege and pollution connected with idolatry, of which certainly the Zealots were not guilty. The Fathers, recognizing this, have seen the fulfilment in the erection of images of the Roman emperors in the temple or its precincts. But we have no account of any such act preceding the final siege. Pilate's attempted introduction of the Roman ensigns was defeated by the threatening attitude of  the people (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:03. 1), and the actual setting up of these ensigns in the sanctuary, and the erection of the statue of Titus, were subsequent to the capture of the city and temple ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:06. 1). Our Lord is plainly referring to something that transpired before the conclusion of the siege, otherwise we might recognize an allusion to the insurrection of Bar-cochebas, which ended in the destruction of the partially rebuilt city, the abolition of its old name, the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the site of the holy place, and the placing of a statue of the emperor upon the altar, A.D. 135. What the "abomination" was cannot now be accurately determined, though its character may be divined from what has been said, and it was probably some anticipation of the antichrist who is to appear before the final consummation, who "exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spoken of by Daniel the prophet,</span> in three passages (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a>), all obscure and difficult, and not necessarily referring to the same events.

Whatever the sign may be, it is to be seen within the temple. (<span class="cmt_word">Whoso</span> <span class="cmt_word">readeth, let him</span> <span class="cmt_word">understand</span>.) There are three ways of regarding this parenthetical clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Alford takes it as "an eeclesiastical note, which, like the doxology in ch. 6:13, has found its way into the text" This is a mere conjecture which has nothing to support it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others consider it to be a remark of St. Matthew, intended to call special attention to the warning; but such an observation is entirely without precedent in the synoptic Gospels, and it is found also in the parallel passage of St. Mark. It is scarcely probable that both these evangelists would have given the identical caution, if it arose from their own motion in respect of those who should read their words before the siege. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It seems more natural to take the clause as uttered by Christ himself with a silent reference to the words of the angel to Daniel, "Know therefore and understand" (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>; comp. 12:10). The Lord would point emphatically to the prophecy of Daniel, and his own interpretation thereof (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-7.htm">2 Timothy 2:7</a>). He seems also to imply that the application is not at once obvious, and needs spiritual insight to discern it. (How, in the face of this declaration of the Son of God, any believer can deny Daniel's claim to be a prophet and the utterer of authentic predictions, is a curious case of mental obfuscation or invincible prejudice.)

Gallus had appeared before the walls, and apparently had every hope of taking the city, when, for some reason not certainly known (either owing to a supposed defeat, or ignorance of his own success, or the advice of his generals), he suddenly withdrew his forces (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:19, 6, 7). The Christians, bearing Christ's warning in mind, and having, as we may conjecture, seen the predicted sign, took the opportunity of flight from the doomed city, and made their escape to Pella, a town of Decapotis, southeast of Bethshean, and the ruins of which are known now by the name of <span class="accented">Fahil.</span> Euschius probably refers to this migration ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:5), narrating that, owing to a certain revelation given to holy men among them, the whole body of the Church, before the war, removed across the Jordan to Pella, and dwelt there in safety during those troublous times. We probably, however, do not know the exact time of the flight, as we are ignorant of what was the warning of imminent danger which rendered this hurried proceeding necessary.

The householder was not to descend by this latter to carry off anything from his chambers within, but to escape at once by the outer staircase (setup. <a href="../../par/luke/5-19.htm">Luke 5:19</a>). The flight was to be precipitate, like that of Lot from Sodom (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/17-32.htm">Luke 17:32</a>). The warning was necessary, as, when the Zealots and assassins bad the upper hand, they allowed no one to leave the city. The warning, however, applied to dwellers in any part of Judaea.

He would naturally lay aside his heavy burnous while engaged in work, but all considerations of propriety and comfort were to be put aside at the present emergency. The warning was to be regarded equally by those in doors or out of doors, at home or abroad.

The sufferings of mothers and children in the siege are narrated by the historian, and even such horrors as are indicated in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-56</a> were not unknown (see Josephus, 'Bell.

Josephus estimates the number of those who fell in the siege and capture of Jerusalem at 1,000,000, the usual population being largely increased by the influx of pilgrims attending the Feast of the Passover, and by thousands of fugitives who had flocked in from the country (Josephus. 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3). He adds that 97,000 were carried away captive during and after the war. <span class="cmt_word">Such as was</span> <span class="cmt_word">not...nor ever shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be</span> (<a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). This is not mere hyperbole, but sober fact. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' Prom. 4) himself bears similar testimony: "Of all the cities under the dominion of Rome, ours was once the most happy, and afterwards the most utterly miserable. For the misfortunes of all the nations upon earth that have ever happened, if they are compared with the calamities to which the Jews were exposed, will, in my opinion, fall far short." Chrysostom sums up the matter thus: "Whence came there thus upon them wrath from God intolerable, and more sore than all that had befallen aforetime, not in Judaea only, but in any part of the world? Is it not quite clear that it was for the deed of the cross and for this rejection? Mark, I pray thee, the exceeding greatness of the ills, when not only compared with the time before, they appear more grievous, but also with all the time to come. For not in all the world, neither in all time that is past, and that is to come, shall any one be able to say such ills have been. And very naturally; for neither had any man perpetrated, not of these that ever have been, nor those to come hereafter, a deed so wicked and horrible" ('Hom.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The "affliction" spoken of refers not only to bodily sufferings, but to that anguish of mind occasioned by acute apprehension and. expectation of danger, such as was felt in the days before the Flood, and at the time of the oppression of Antiochus Epiphanes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except these days should be shortened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">had been</span> <span class="accented">shortened</span>). In the midst of wrath God thinks on mercy. He providentially ordained that the days of vengeance should not be indefinitely prolonged; the siege was practically of short duration, the country was not wholly overrun and desolated (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>). The natural causes that combined to produce this shortening of the siege have been recounted by commentators. These were - the divided counsels of the Jews themselves, the voluntary surrender of parts of the fortifications, the fierce factions in the city, the destruction of magazines of provisions by calamitous fire, the suddenness of the arrival of Titus, and the fact that the walls had never been strengthened, as Herod Agrippa had intended. <span class="cmt_word">There should no flesh be saved;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole Jewish nation would have been annihilated. <span class="cmt_word">For the elect's sake.</span> At the intercession of the  escaped Christians, who offered up unceasing prayer for their brethren and countrymen, God lessened the duration of the calamities. "The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working" (<a href="../../par/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). Ten righteous would have saved Sodom; Lot's intercession did preserve Zoar (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>). Some, not so suitably, explain "the elect" to be those Jews who should hereafter turn to the Lord; or the elect seed, "beloved for the fathers' sake" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>). We may well believe that the local tribulations, such as are intimated by Daniel and Christ, and their limitation in time, are a picture of what shall happen in the last days, the intermediate fulfilment being the prelude of the final accomplishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-23.htm">Matthew 24:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here <i>is</i> Christ, or there; believe <i>it</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then.</span> The third section of the prophecy, contained in vers. 23-35, passes from the fortunes of Jerusalem to the end of the world. To the Lord's hearers was conveyed the truth that the signs and events now indicated were to be subsequent to the destruction of the city. No further note of chronology was given. The uncertainty of the future caused a state of constant expectation and hope. And this is the feeling which we Christians are intended to embrace and cultivate. "The word 'then' relates not to the connection in the order of time with the things just mentioned,...  not meaning what should follow straightway after these things, but what should be in the time when these things were to be done of which he was about to speak" (St. Chrysostom, 'Horn.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, here is Christ!</span> This refers to something different from the announcement in ver. 5.

That such men did work actual miracles, or what were regarded as such, cannot be reasonably doubted. Satan was on their side, and, as far as he was permitted, confirmed their teaching by supernatural assistance. St. Paul testifies that such should be the action of the antichrist, "whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13, 14</a>). Many of these wonders may have been effectuated by natural forces unknown to the majority of men, and therefore considered as superhuman; others may have been derived from the spiritual world, but necessarily from that realm thereof which is under the control of evil demons. Whatever may have been their source, they were displayed in support of lies and errors, and had a certain success. <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the very</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, even) <span class="cmt_word">elect</span>.

The translation ought to run, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">so as to lead</span> <span class="accented">astray, if possible even the elect</span>, signifying the difficulty, not the impossibility, of drawing them away from the truth. "The elect" are Christians, true followers of Jesus, and members of his Church. These may fall from the faith, for they are not yet finally safe, and on that chance Satan builds; but as long as they rest on Christ, looking to him for guidance and protection, trying the spirits by the Word of God and by the truths which they have learned in creed and worship, they stand firm against the strongest temptations.

The warning was needed in the first age; it will be needed in the last. The prediction was known before the ruin of Jerusalem, and doubtless preserved many from falling victims to the seducers at that period; it must be used now and till the end to preserve Christians from the errors of infidelity, false philosophy, agnosticism. That such attacks on their faith shall be made is a proof of Christ's omniscience; that he gives here and in the next verses premonitions of danger, with counsel how to avoid it, is evidence of his love and care for his elect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-26.htm">Matthew 24:26</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, <i>he is</i> in the secret chambers; believe <i>it</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Wherefore if</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">if therefore</span>). The Lord proceeds to make the matter more plain by entering into details which  the "here" and "there" of ver. 23 had not sufficiently denoted. He (Christ) is in the desert. If there was a partial fulfilment of this warning at the siege of Jerusalem, when some impostors tried to persuade the people that Messiah was in the wilderness, preparing to march to their relief, it is to have its chief accomplishment just before the final consummation. <span class="cmt_word">Go not forth</span>.

When Christ comes the second time, he will not come as at Bethlehem, in secret, in a corner. If any pretender should be announced under such conditions, they were to put no belief in him. These were simple tests which all could apply. To limit the Lord's appearance to particular persons or to a particular place, was to incur fatal error. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a></div><div class="verse">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the lightning...east...west.</span> That is, shines from one end of heaven to the other. St. Chrysostom's comment explains the similitude: "How, then, shineth the lightning? It needs not one to talk of it, it needs not a herald, but even to them in chambers it shows itself in an instant of time throughout the whole world. So shall that coming be, showing itself at once everywhere by reason of the shining forth of his glory." We are told, "every eye shall see him." His advent shall be sudden, universal, unmistakable; in a moment he shall be present, visible in all his power and glory. From the language of this verse probably has been derived the orientation of churches, and the mode adopted of depositing the bodies of deceased Christians, so that they may at the resurrection face the Lord when he comes from the east. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a></div><div class="verse">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The particle seems to be spurious, and is omitted by late editors. Christ applies a proverbial saying in confirmation of the certainty and universality of is appearance. He had used the same under other circumstances (Luke 17:87); and analogous expressions are found in <a href="../../par/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever the carcase</span> (<span class="greek_word">ptw  =  ma</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</span> Eagles (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) do not live on carrion, so that here probably vultures are meant. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">nesher</span>, translated "eagle" in our version, often signifies "the vulture," as in <a href="../../par/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. This bird's keenness of sight is almost incredible; it will discern a prey at an enormous distance, and its movements being watched by others, all eager to secure food, a carcase is very quickly surrounded by a multitude of these rapacious birds, flocking from all quarters. What our Lord meant by this proverb has occasioned great disputation. If Christ were referring primarily and chiefly to Jerusalem, it would be easy to explain "the carcase" to be the corrupt city, "the eagles" the ministers of God's vengeance, especially the Roman armies, whose standards bore the image of this bird of prey. Or if it were a mere general truth, and to be taken entirely in a spiritual sense, the gnome would imply that moral corruption calls for heavenly chastisement. But neither of these interpretations would satisfy the context, which speaks of Christ's second advent. Hence many regard the sentence as altogether parallel to the preceding verse, expressing in metaphor that which was there set forth in more direct terms, viz. that all men shall assemble to the place where Christ shall summon them to be judged, as vultures congregate round a carcase. In this case the carcase is Christ, the eagles or vultures are the men to be judged. This exposition has satisfied commentators of reputation, but it has its weak points. One fails to see the propriety of describing men coming to the great assize as vultures gathering to devour a dead body, or how in this case the body can be Christ or the place of his appearance. More probable is the interpretation which regards the carcase as antichrist or the world power, and the eagles as the saints and angels who shall attend Christ when he comes in judgment (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>). Others expound the clause entirely in a mystical sense. The carcase is Christ, or the body of Christ; the eagles are the saints, or true Christians; these, whatever happens, will, with keen spiritual sight, always be able to discern Christ and his body, and to flock thereto. He calls himself <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, because he saves us by his death, and feeds us by his body, in his Church, Word, and sacraments (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Such is the interpretation of many of the Fathers, and it has many analogies in other places of Scripture. Far be it from us to restrict the sphere of Divine prediction, or to assert that any legitimate reference which we may discover was not in the Lord's mind when he spake the words. But it is more simple to regard the proverbial saying in itself, without looking for abstruse or mystical meanings. As a carcase, fall where it may, is immediately observed by the vultures and attracts them, so Christ's coming shall at once be discerned by all men and draw them into it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a></div><div class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Immediately</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, <span class="accented">but immediately</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>after the tribulation of those days.</span> The particle must not be disregarded, as it implies a caution with respect to the parousia. The Lord proceeds to announce some details of the final advent. Taking the tribulation to be the single fact of the  ruin of Jerusalem, with its accompanying horrors, some have explained the Lord's word "immediately after" by the foreshortening process of prophecy, which makes the distant future seem close to the obtruding present, or by the consideration that in God's view time does not exist: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). But the truth is, the tribulation (ver. 21) only began with the fall of Jerusalem; that was its first and partial fulfilment; and, am St. Luke implies (<a href="../../par/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23, 24</a>), it has been going on ever since, and is not yet finished. The punishment of the Jews is still proceeding, Jerusalem is still trodden down by the Gentiles, wrath still lies upon the people, they are still dispersed over the world, and have been and are more or leas persecuted in many countries. This state of things is to continue "till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled;" it is, then, "immediately after" this that the signs announced by the Lord shall be seen. He is, as we said above (see on ver. 4), purposely indefinite, that the Church may learn to wait and watch for the return of the Saviour and Judge. This state of expectatation is to be its normal condition. It had its effect on the primitive Church before she Jewish catastrophe. St. Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19-21</a>) tells of the times of refreshing, when Jesus shall come, as possibly close at hand; St. Paul more than once speaks in the same strain (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, etc.), though he warns his converts not to omit ordinary duties in immediate expectation of the end (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>); St. James (James 5:9) tells of the Judge standing before the door. And since then often has this belief cropped up at various stages of the world's history, showing that Christ's warning has sunk deep into Christian hearts, and produced the temper of mind which he purposed to raise. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the sun be darkened,</span> etc. There is no valid reason why the physical phenomena mentioned in this verso are not to be taken literally, even if we see also in them a spiritual significance. It is only reasonable to expect that the end of this world should be accompanied by stupendous changes in the realm of nature. The sun was miraculously darkened when Jesus hung on the cross. What wonder if similar catastrophes signal his coming to judgment? The apostle's words point to a literal fulfilment (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>). Our Lord's prediction echoes announcements often found in the Old Testament, which are not always to be considered metaphorical (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). Anticipations of some of these terrible latter day signs occurred at Jerusalem, according to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:05.3,4). <span class="cmt_word">Darkened... not give light.</span> This is in accordance with Hebrew parallelism. The next clause is constructed in the same way. <span class="cmt_word">Fall from heaven.</span> The Lord may be speaking of the apparent effect of these convulsions of nature, in accordance with popular ideas, as we talk of the sun rising and setting; or he may thus term the obscuration or extinction of the light of the stars. <span class="cmt_word">The powers of the heavens</span> mean probably the heavenly bodies independent of the solar system, called elsewhere "the host of heaven" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>. etc.); or the phrase may signify (though the parallelism would not be so perfect) the forces and laws which control these bodies. An interruption in the action of these powers would occasion the most awful catastrophes (see Haggai 3:6, which makes a similar announcement). We must notice the spiritual application of this prediction, as it has obtained a wide acceptance. The words are sometimes taken in a bad sense. The sun is Satan, or Lucifer, who fell as lightning from heaven (<a href="../../par/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>); "the powers of the heavens" are the hosts of the prince of the power of the air, "the spiritual wickednesses in high places;" the stars are all that exalt themselves, who shall be consumed and vanish at the brightness of the cross. But more generally the luminaries are explained in a good sense. The sun is Christ or his truth, which shall be obscured in the last days; the moon is the Church, darkened by heresy and unbelief, and borrowing no light from its sun; the stars are they who once were foremost in the faith, but now shall fall from their steadfastness, or be unable to diffuse light, owing to the gross darkness and mistiness of those evil days.

The cross shows that he died for them, though they profited not by his sacrifice (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall see</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,, an echo of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

Some manuscripts, with the Vulgate, read, "with a trumpet and a great voice;" others, "with a great trumpet," omitting "voice." All, however, agree in asserting the employment of the trumpet on this momentous occasion (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).

Of course, the occurrence is supernatural. It is, indeed, as great a miracle for a sound to be heard simultaneously in both hemispheres as it is for Christ to be seen at the same moment by all dwellers on the globe.

He cites <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-3.htm">Jeremiah 8:3</a> (Septuagint); <a href="../../par/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>, etc., in confirmation of this signification. His examples, however, are not unassailable, though such use is certainly classical; but it the same time, it is unlikely that Christ should thus indefinitely postpone a period of infinite importance to his hearers. But there is no necessity for assuming any unusual meaning in the term "this generation." Its plain and obvious reference is to the contemporaries of the speaker, or those who shall live some thirty or forty years longer; this period would bring them to the siege of Jerusalem. And remembering that Christ has drawn no definite line between this crisis and the final consummation, we are justified in regarding all these things as meaning, primarily, the signs preceding or accompanying the downfall of the city. In a secondary sense, "this generation" may mean the spiritual Israel, the generation of them that seek the Lord (<a href="../../par/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>). "All these things shall surely come to pass," says Chrysostom, "and the generation of the faithful shall remain, cut off by none of the things that have been mentioned. For both Jerusalem shall perish, and the more part of the Jews shall be destroyed, but over this generation shall nothing prevail - not famine, not pestilence, not earthquake, not the tumults of wars, not false Christs, not false prophets, not deceivers, not traitors, not those that cause to offend, nor the false brethren, nor any other such-like temptations whatever." Some critics have combined the three meanings of "generation" given above, and have seen in Christ's words a threefold reference, first, to the contemporary people; secondly, to the Jewish nation; thirdly, to the Christian believers or dispensation. According to Lange, "this generation" means the generation of those who know and discern these signs.

The facts and truths embodied in his words are sure and steadfast, and what he has promised or predicted shall inevitably be fulfilled.

A kind of climax.</span> Man is naturally excluded from the knowledge; but even to the angels it has not been revealed. A further climax is added in St. Mark, and from that Gospel has been introduced by some very good manuscripts into this place, <span class="accented">neither the Son</span> (the Revised Version admits the clause). The words have given occasion to some erroneous statements. It is said by Arians and semi-Arians, and modern disputants who have followed in their steps, that the Son cannot be equal to the Father, if he knows not what the Father knows. Alford says boldly, "This matter was hidden from him." But when we consider such passages as "I and my Father are one;" "I am in the Father, and the Father in me" (<a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>, etc.), we cannot believe that the time of the great consummation was unknown to him. What is meant, then, by this assertion? How is it true? Doubtless it is to be explained (if capable of explanation) by the hypostatic union of two natures in the Person of Christ, whereby the properties of the two natures are interchangeably predicated. From danger of error on this mysterious subject we are preserved by the precise terms of the Athanasian Creed, according to which we affirm that Christ is "equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood ... one altogether; not by confusion of substance, but by unity of Person," etc. If, then, Christ asserts that he is ignorant of anything, it must be that in his human nature he hath, willed not to know that which in his Divine nature he was cognizant cf. This is a part of that voluntary self-surrender and self-limitation of which the apostle speaks when he says that Christ "emptied himself" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). He condescended to assume all the conditions of humanity, even willing to share the imperfection of our knowledge in some particulars. How the two natures thus interworked we know not, and need not conjecture; nor can we always divine why prominence at one time is given to the Divine, at another to the human. It is enough for us to know that, for reasons which seemed good unto him, he imposed restriction on his omniscience in this matter, and, to enhance the mysteriousness and awfulness of the great day, announced to his disciples his ignorance of the precise moment of its occurrence. This is a safer exposition than to say, with some, that Christ knew not the  day so as to reveal it to us, that it was no part of his mission from the Father to divulge it to men, and therefore that he could truly say he knew it not. This seems rather an evasion than an explanation of the difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">But my Father only.</span> The best manuscripts have "the Father." "But" is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, <span class="accented">except.</span> So Christ said to his inquiring apostles, "It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). These words do not exclude the Son's participation in the knowledge, though he willed that it should not extend to his human nature. With this and such-like texts in view, how futile, presumptuous, and indeed profane, it is to attempt to settle the exact date and hour when the present age shall end!"

If, as seems probable, the antediluvians had more than a century's warning of the coming flood, it can hardly be only the suddenness of the calamity to which Christ would point (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>). He has used the illustration elsewhere (<a href="../../par/luke/17-26.htm">Luke 17:26, 27</a>), where also the destruction of Sodom is adduced as a type of the last day.

The word for "eating" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) implies the idea of gnawing food greedily like an animal, hence eating gluttonously.

The Lord assures us that similar recklessness and unbelief will be found at his coming. Doubtless anguish and fear will fill many hearts, but the general feeling will be incredulity, and a false security which refuses to take warning. Sadler compares it to Belshazzar's feast at the very moment of danger, and the Athenians' insensibility at the time of the great plague, when the people seemed to be exemplifying the maxim, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>). "For like as when the ark was making, they believed not; but while it was set in the midst of them, proclaiming beforehand the evils that are to come, they, when they saw it, lived in pleasure...  so also now, antichrist, indeed, shall appear, after whom is the end, and the punishments at the end, and vengeance intolerable; but they that are held by the intoxication of wickedness [comp. Wisd. 4:12] shall not so much as perceive the dreadful nature of the things that are on the point of being done. Wherefore also Paul saith, 'as travail upon a woman with child' [<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>], even so shall those fearful and incurable evils come upon them" (Chrysostom, 'Hom.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Morisen considers that Christ is not blaming the antediluvians, but simply referring to the fact that up to the last moment they were ignorant of the impending catastrophe. But this seems inadequate.

The "taking" implies separation from companions, as <a href="../../par/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>, etc. This is the work of the angels (ver. 31). There is some doubt as to the destiny of the two classes named. Are the good "taken" and the evil "left"? or are the evil "taken" and the good "left"? Some suppose that the terms allude to the sudden approach of a hostile army by which some are taken prisioners and others allowed to escape; or, since in the parable the tares are first gathered for the burning, those taken must be the wicked, those left are for storing in the everlasting garner. On the other hand, many commentators understand the verbs in a sense opposite to that mentioned above. As (ver. 31) the angels are sent forth to gather the elect, the "taken" are of this class, who are caught away to meet the Lord and his saints (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>), while the others are left for judgment and reprobation (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-9</a>).

The latter interpretation of the two seems to be the correct one. At any rate,  it is plain that the nicest discrimination is exercised, and that among men and women, in all conditions of life, a final severance shall then be made, which shall apportion their lot in the other world.

"Two stones, about eighteen inches or two feet across, rest one on the other, the under one slightly higher towards the centre, and the upper one hollowed out to fit this convexity; a hole through it, in the middle, receiving the grain. Sometimes the under stone is bedded m cement, raised into a border round it, to catch and retain the flour, or meal, as it falls. A stick fastened into the upper one served as a handle. Occasionally two women sit at the same pair of stones, to lighten the task, one hand only being needed where two work together, whereas a single person has to use both hands" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' p. 155). "Two women were busy in a cottage at the household mill, which attracted me by its sound To grind is very exhausting work, so that, where possible, one woman sits opposite the other, to divide the strain, though in a poor man's house the wife has to do this drudgery unaided" (ibid., p. 661). St. Luke (Luke 17:34) adds a third situation to the cases mentioned by our Lord, viz. "two men in one bed," or on one dining couch.

Few exhortations are more frequently and impressively given than this of the duty and necessity of watchfulness. Of course, the Christian has to watch against many things - his own evil heart, temptation, the world, but most of all he must watch and be always looking for the coming of his Lord; for whether he be regarded as Redeemer, Deliverer, or Judge, he will come as a thief in the night. <span class="cmt_word">What hour.</span> Very many good manuscripts and some late editors read "on what day."

The significance of the parable is easy to see. The householder is the disciple of Christ, the thief is Christ himself, who comes on the unwatchful when and where they expect him not. It is, indeed, a strange comparison, but one calculated to alarm the unwary, and to show the necessity of the caution enjoined.

In <a href="../../par/luke/12-41.htm">Luke 12:41</a>, etc, Christ utters this parabolic discourse in reply to Peter's question, "Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?" He now turns his exhortation to those in authority over the house, specially to the ministers and stewards of his mysteries, proposing it in an interrogative form, not only because the man he wants is difficult to find, but in order that each may put the question to himself, and see if he reaches the high standard suggested. <span class="cmt_word">Is a</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faithful and wise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">prudens, practically wise</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>.

So the stewards of the mysteries of Christ have to feed his flock with spiritual food, with the Word and sacraments, and. to do this wisely and discreetly, according to the capacity, advancement, and circumstances of each recipient. The exhortation holds good for others as well as the clergy, civil rulers, the rich, all men. All our endowments, mental, spiritual, physical, material, are the gift of God, and are to be used in his service and to the good of others.

This mode of death was inflicted in some cases (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>; compare also the account of the execution of Mettius in Livy, 1:28; and Horace, 'Sat.,' I. 1:99). Thus in our own country "quartering," after hanging at least, was once a usual penalty for some offences, such as high treason. The term has been here interpreted to refer to the operation of the cruel scourge, which without metaphor might be said to cut a man to pieces; or "to dismiss from his employment," which seems to be hardly an adequate punishment. The difficulty is that the utter destruction of the malefactor implied in his literal cutting asunder is not consistent with his subsequent consignment to the lot of the hypocrites. Hence the Fathers have variously explained the term to signify  separation from the company of saints, or from spiritual grace, or from all the blessings promised to the righteous. But we may take the Lord's words as applying first to temporal punishment - the unrighteous steward shall suffer death as horrible as dichotomy, a severance of body and soul, accompanied with unspeakable tortures; as in the History of Susanna, ver. 55, "The angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two." <span class="cmt_word">Appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.</span> The Lord drops the parable, and speaks of the terrible reality.

This parable, as a continuation of the teaching of the last chapter, sets forth the necessity of having and retaining grace unto the end, in order to be able to welcome the advent of Christ. The duty of watchfulness and preparation for the great day is, of course, implied and set forth (ver. 13); but the point is that the oil of God's grace alone  enables the soul to meet the bridegroom joyfully, without dismay. The usual marriage customs of the Jews are well known. On the appointed day, the bridegroom, accompanied by his friends, proceeded to the bride's house, and thence escorted her, with her attendant maidens and friends, to his own or his parents' home. In the parable, however, the proceedings are somewhat different. Here the bridegroom is not in the town, but somewhere at a distance, so that, though the day is settled, the exact hour of his arrival is uncertain. He will come in the course of the night, and the virgins who are to meet him have assembled in the house where the wedding is to take place. They wait for the smnmons to go forth and meet the bridegroom and conduct him to the bridal place; and when the signal is given that he is approaching, they set forth on the road, each bearing her lamp (Edersheim). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. The time refers to the hour of the Lord's advent (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-50.htm">Matthew 24:50, 51</a>), and the parousia of the Son of man (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall the kingdom of heaven be likened.</span> At the time named something analogous to the coming story shall happen in the Church, in the gospel dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Ten virgins.</span> Ten is the number of perfection; such a number of persons was required to form a synagogue, and to be present at any office, ceremony, or formal benediction. Talmudic authorities affirm that the lamps used in bridal processions were usually ten. The "virgins" here are the friends of the bride, who are arranged to sally forth to meet the bridegroom as soon as his approach is signalled. "The Church, in her aggregate and ideal unity, is the bride; the members of the Church, as individually called, are guests; in their separation from the world, and expectation of the Lord's coming, they are his virgins" (Lange). The bride herself is not named in the parable, as she is not needed for illustration, and the virgins occupy her place. These virgins represent believers divided into two sections; evidently they are all supposed to hold the true faith, and to be pure and undefiled followers of the Lord (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>), to be waiting for his coming, and to love his appearing; but some fail for lack of grace or of perseverance, as is shown further on. <span class="cmt_word">Their lamps</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, better <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">their own lamps</span>). They all made separate and personal, independent preparation for the meeting. These lamps (for they were not torches) were, as Dr. Edersheim notes, hollow cups or saucers, with a round receptacle for the wick, which was fed with pitch or oil. They were on these occasions fastened to a long wooden pole, and borne aloft in the procession. <span class="cmt_word">Went forth.</span> This does not refer to the final going forth to meet the bridegroom on the road (ver. 6), as it is absurd to suppose that they all fell asleep by the wayside, with their lamps in their hands (ver. 5), and, as a fact, only five went out at last; but it doubtless intimates that they left their own homes to unite in duly celebrating the wedding. <span class="cmt_word">To meet the bridegroom.</span> An evident interpolation adds, "and the bride," which the authorized Vulgate unhappily confirms, reading, <span class="accented">exierunt obviam sponso et sponsae.</span> In this case the scene refers to the bridegroom's return in company with his bride. But this is a misconception, as no mention is made of the bride anywhere in the genuine text. The bridegroom comes to fetch home the bride; and these maidens, her friends, assembled in her house to be ready to escort him thither (cf. 1 Macc. 9:37). The wedding seems to take place at the bride'e house, as <a href="../../par/judges/14-10.htm">Judges 14:10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-2.htm">Matthew 25:2</a></div><div class="verse">And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five of them were wise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and five were foolish.</span> The best uncials (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, D, L) invert the clauses, in agreement with the order in vers. 3, 4. So the Vulgate. In this case the idea would be that the foolish were a more prominent and noticeable class than the others. All the virgins were outwardly the same, were provided with the same lamps, prepared to perform the same office; the difference in their characters is proved by the result. Their folly is seen in the fact that at the time of action they were unable to do the part which a little care and forethought would have enabled them to perform successfully. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a></div><div class="verse">They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that were foolish</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>)...  <span class="cmt_word">took no oil with them</span>. It has been doubted whether they brought no oil of their own at all, trusting to get their lamps filled by others, or whether they neglected to bring an additional supply to replenish them when exhausted. The latter seems most likely to be the sense intended; as the spiritual aspect of the parable places both classes in exactly the same position at starting, and we know from other sources that, the oil reservoirs being very small, it was the custom to carry another vessel from which to refill them. Some good manuscripts commence the verse with "for," thus making the verse justify the epithets applied to the virgins. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-4.htm">Matthew 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In their vessels.</span> These were the flasks or vases carried by the maidens to replenish the oil in the lamps as occasion  demanded. The contrast between the two classes seems to lie in the foresight of the one and the negligent carelessness of the other. It has been common from early times to find in the lamps the symbol of faith, in the oil the good works that proceed therefrom. The wise virgins exercise their faith in charity and good works; the foolish profess, indeed, the faith of Christ but carry it not out to the production of the good works in which God ordained that they should walk (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). But this exposition, time honored though it is, surely does not meet the requirements of the parable. What one wants is an interpretation which shall show how it is that the want of oil and its sudden failure debar one from meeting the bridegroom. If the oil be good works, and the believer has gone on doing these until the Lord's advent is signalled, why should he fail at the last? How comes it that in a moment he leaves off doing his duty, and making his calling and election sure? These are questions which the patristic and mediaeval explanation leaves unsolved. I doubt not that the right solution is to be found in regarding the oil as symbolical of the Holy Spirit, or the graces of God. This is a truly scriptural notion, as declared by the use of this substance in holy rites. Accepting this view, we should say that the ten virgins had so far alike taken and used the grace of God, but that they differed in this - that, while the wise maintained the supply of grace by constant recourse to the means thereof, the foolish were satisfied with their spiritual state once for all, and took no pains to keep their spiritual life healthful and active by the renewal of the Holy Spirit in their hearts. They retained the outward show and form of faith, but neglected the true inward life of faith; they had the appearance without the reality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-5.htm">Matthew 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While the bridegroom tarried</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-48.htm">Matthew 24:48</a>). We may suppose that all had lighted their lamps at first, in expectation of being immediately called to meet the bridegroom. But he came not. The advent of Christ was not to be as speedy as the disciples imagined. No one could divine when it would take place. As St. Augustine says, "Latet ultimus dies, ut observetur omnis dies." See here a figure of each Christian's probation. <span class="cmt_word">They all slumbered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">and slept</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) The first verb implies the nodding and napping of persons sitting up at night; the second means "they began to sleep," actually. All, wise and foolish, did this; so in itself it was not sinful, it was only natural. To such drowsiness the best of Christians are liable. The bow cannot be kept always strung; "Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo." Having made all preparations, the virgins ceased for a while to think of the bridegroom's coming. The Fathers take this sleep to be an image of death, the awaking to be the resurrection, when the difference between the two classes is known and displayed. But this would imply that all the faithful will be dead when the Lord comes, which is contrary to <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. Nor, on the other hand, is it conceivable that they whose lamps are kept burning till the day of death will be unprovided when the Lord comes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-6.htm">Matthew 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At midnight.</span> When sleep is deepest and awaking most unwelcome. The Lord will come "as a thief in the night" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There was a cry made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">hath been made</span>). The cry comes either from the watchers or from the advancing company. We are told by the apostle (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>) that "the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God." The suddenness of the event is indicated by the tense of the verb - "there hath been," "there is," a cry. <span class="cmt_word">The bridegroom cometh!</span> The best manuscripts omit the verb, which omission makes the expression more graphic. The bridegroom is Christ; he comes now to judge, to punish and reward; and Christians have to meet him, and show how their duties have been performed, and how their personal preparation has been made. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-7.htm">Matthew 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trimmed their lamps.</span> The trimming consisted in removing the charred portion of the wick, and raising the wick itself by means of a pointed wire which was fastened by a chain to each lamp. These operations would be followed by the replenishment of the vase with oil from the vessel carried for what purpose. In a spiritual sense the dormant grace has to be revived at the awful summons. It had, indeed, come upon all unexpectedly at the moment; but while one party was ready to meet the emergency, the other was wholly unprepared. The foolish, indeed, got their wicks ready to light, when they suddenly discovered that they had no oil in their lamps, and remembered that they had brought no further supply with them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-8.htm">Matthew 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The foolish said unto the wise.</span> They apply to their prudent companions for aid at this crisis.

The lamps, fresh trimmed, had burned for a few moments, and then, having no oil, soon waned and died out. Spiritually speaking, the idea of these people seems to have been that the merits of others could supply their lack, or that there was a general  store of grace to which they could have recourse, and which would serve instead of individual personal preparation. See here a terrible warning against delay in the matter of the soul, or against trusting to a death bed repentance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-9.htm">Matthew 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so</i>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Not so; <span class="cmt_word">lest there be not enough</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, <span class="accented">haply it will not suffice</span>). Edersheim renders, "Not at all - it will never suffice for us and you," in order to give the force of the double negation. In Aristotle, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is often equivalent to "perhaps," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> 'Eth. Nic.,' 10:1. 3. "Even so they failed," says St. Chrysostom, "and neither the humanity of those of whom they begged, nor the easiness of their request, nor their necessity and want, made them obtain their petition. And what do we learn from hence? That no man can protect us there if we are betrayed by our works; not because he will not, but because he cannot. For these, too, take refuge in the impossibility. This the blessed Abraham also indicated, saying, 'Between us and you there is a great gulf,' so that not even when willing is it permitted them to pass it." <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (probably spurious) <span class="cmt_word">go ye rather to them that sell</span>. The answer is not harsh, and the advice is not ironical or unkind. The wise cannot of themselves supply the lack. They have no superabundant store of grace to communicate to others; at best even they are unprofitable servants; the righteous shall scarcely be saved; so they direct their companions to the only source where effectual grace may be obtained. They that sell are the ministers and stewards of Christ's mysteries, who dispense the means of grace. These are said to be bought, as the treasure hid in the field or the pearl of great price is bought (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>). Divine grace can always be procured by those who will pay the price thereof; and the price is faith and prayer and earnestness, - nothing more, nothing less (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). But the time is short; delay is fatal; hence the counsel so urgently given, "Go ye," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Buy for yourselves</span>. This is important. Every one must bear his own burden. The grace must be their own; what is required of those who would meet the Bridegroom without shame and fear is personal preparation, personal faith and holiness. We shall be judged individually; our Christian virtues must be entirely our own, wrought in us by the grace of God, with which we have humbly and thankfully cooperated. It is curious that some ancient and modern commentators see in this part of the parable, only an ornamental detail without special signification. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-10.htm">Matthew 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While they went to buy.</span> They followed the advice given them. Whether they were successful or not is left untold; the issue would have been the same in either case; their return would have been too late. The opportunity they had had was not properly used; when preparation was comparatively easy they had neglected to make it; they had been once converted, so to speak, and rested in that fact, and thought it sufficient for all time, omitting to seek for daily supplies of grace, and now they find themselves miserably deceived. There is a certain wilful forgetfulness and negligence which can never be remedied on this side the grave. <span class="cmt_word">They that were ready.</span> The five wise virgins who had made provision for the meeting, had renewed the grace of God in their hearts, and kept it alive by diligence and perseverance, according to the apostle's counsel (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went in with him to the marriage</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the marriage feast</span>). They not only duly met the bridegroom on his way, but accompanied him into the joyful scene, the bridal feast, the type of all spiritual happiness (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). "This world," says 'Pirke Aboth,' "is like the vestibule, the world to come is like the dining chamber: prepare thyself in the vestibule, that thou mayest be able to enter into the dining chamber." Well says the Son of Sirach, "Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified" (Ecclus. 18:22). <span class="cmt_word">The door was shut</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/13-25.htm">Luke 13:25</a>). It is customary in the East, at great entertainments, to close the doors when all the guests are assembled. So at our universities, during the dinner hour, the gates of the colleges are always shut. Scott, in 'Old Mortality' (ch. 8. note), remarks that this custom was rigorously observed in Scotland. When the door is shut in the parable, there is no more entrance for any one. Trench quotes St. Augustine's saying, "Non inimicus intrat, nec amicus exit." Christ is the door by which our prayers reach God; through him alone they prevail; when this is closed the access to the heavenly throne is barred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-11.htm">Matthew 25:11</a></div><div class="verse">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> They apply to the bridegroom himself as now taking the direction of affairs. So when Christ the spiritual Bridegroom comes, he rules over all. Here, as elsewhere in the parable, the great spiritual reality shines through the earthly delineation. Whether the five foolish ones obtained oil or not at this late hour matters nothing; they were too late to do that which they had to do, too late to join in the bridal procession, and thus procure admission to the festival. Their piteous cry is not answered as they hoped. It is too late to ask for mercy when it is the time of vengeance. In this present state of grace we have the comforting injunction, "Knock, and it shall be opened  unto you;" in the day of retribution the door is shut, and no knocking will unclose its barred portal. True it is that "not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-12.htm">Matthew 25:12</a></div><div class="verse">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know you not.</span> They had not been in the bridal company, nor joined in the festive procession, so the bridegroom could only answer from within that he had no knowledge of them. What is meant spiritually by this rejection is doubtful. This is not a solitary instance of the use of the expression. In the sermon on the mount Christ declared that his sentence on those that professed, but practised not, would be, "I never knew you: depart from me!" (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>). He is said to know those whom he approves and acknowledges to be his (see <a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>). God says of Abraham, "I know him" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>) and of Moses, "I know thee by name" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>). To be known of God is a higher blessing than to know God (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). Many think that the words of our text imply utter reprobation. So Nosgen; and Chrysostom writes, "When he hath said this, nothing else but hell is left, and that intolerable punishment; or rather, this word is more grievous even than hell. This word he speaks also to them that work iniquity." But we must observe that in the present ease we have not the terrible addition, "Depart from me!" The sentence of exclusion from Christ's presence is not equivalent to that in ver. 41, which dooms souls to the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. These five virgins had received the grace of God, and used it well for a time, and only failed at the last for lack of care and watchfulness. They had still some love for the Lord, still desired to serve him; it is not conceivable that they should suffer the same punishment as the utterly godless and profane, whose wickedness was perfect and Satanic. Doubtless they were punished; but as there are degrees of happiness in heaven, so there may be gradation of pains and penalties for those debarred from its blessings (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>). But it is not improbable that the exclusion in the first place refers to the deprivation of participation in Messiah's future kingdom, whatever that may be, according to the vision in <a href="../../par/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>, and that the proceedings at the final judgment are not here intended.

Tertullian well says, "Ut pendula expectatione solicitude fidei probetur, semper diem observans, dum semper ignorat, quotidie timens quod quotidie sperat" ('De Anima,' 33). It remains to observe that, mystically, Christ is the Bridegroom, who celebrates his nuptials with his bride the Church, and comes to conduct her to heaven; those who are ready will accompany him and enter into the joy of their Lord; those who have not made their calling sure will be shut out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-30.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the talents.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) Following on the lesson of watchfulness and inward personal preparation just given, this parable enforces the necessity of external work and man's accountability to God for the due use of the special endowments which he has received. The former was concerned chiefly with the contemplative life, the waiting virgins; this chiefly with the active, the working servant; though, in fact, both states combine more or less in the good Christian, and the perfect disciple will unite in himself the characteristics of John and Peter, Mary and Martha. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11-27</a>) has recorded a somewhat analogous parable spoken by Christ on leaving the house of Zacchaeus, known as the parable of the pounds; and some critics have deemed that the two accounts relate to the same saying altered in some details, which are to be accounted for on the hypothesis that St. Luke has combined with our parable another on the rebellious citizens. That there are great resemblances between the two cannot be disputed, but the discrepancies are too marked to allow us to assume the unity of the two utterances. Christ often repeats himself, using the same figure, or illustration, or expression to enforce different truths or different phases of the same truth, as here he may have desired more emphatically to impress on the disciples their special responsibilities. The variations in the two parables are briefly these: The scene and occasion are different; this was spoken to the disciples, that to the multitude; in one the lord is a noble who was to receive a kingdom, in the other he is simply a landowner; here his absence is a matter of local space, there it is a matter of time; the servants are  ten in the one case, and three in the other; ill one we have pounds spoken of, in the other talents; in St. Luke each servant has the same sum delivered to him, in St. Matthew the amount is divided into talents, five, two, and one; in the "pounds" the servants show differing faithfulness with the same gifts, in the "talents" two of them display the same faithfulness with differing gifts; here the idle servant hides his money in a napkin, there he buries it in the earth; the conclusions also of the parables vary. Their object is not identical: the parable in our text illustrates the truth that we shall be judged according to that which we have received; the parable in St. Luke shows, to use Trench's words, that "as men differ in fidelity, in zeal, in labour, so will they differ in the amount of their spiritual gain." The latter treats of the use of gifts common to all, whether bodily, mental, or spiritual, such as one faith, one baptism, reason, conscience, sacraments, the Word of God; the former is concerned with the exercise of endowments which have been bestowed according to the recipient's capacity and his ability to make use of them, - the question being, how he has employed his powers, opportunities, and circumstances, the particular advantages, examples, and means of grace given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> the kingdom of heaven is <span class="cmt_word">as a man</span> The opening sentence in the original is anacoluthic, and our translators have supplied what they supposed to be wanting. The Greek has only, <span class="accented">For just as a man</span>, etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">sicut enim homo.</span> The other member of the comparison is not expressed. The Revised Version gives," It is as when a man." They who receive the possible interpolation at the end of ver. 13 would simply render, "For he (the Son of man) is as a man." The Authorized Version plainly affords the intended meaning in the words of the usual preface to such parables (ver. 1; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 31</a>, etc.). The conjunction "for" carries us back to the Lord's solemn injunction, introducing a new illustration of the necessity of watchfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Travelling into a far country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">leaving home</span>). Here our Lord, being about to withdraw his bodily presence from the earth and to ascend into heaven, represents himself as a man going into another country, and first putting his affairs in order and issuing instructions to his servants (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3; 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who called his own</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">servants</span>.

This was not an absolute gift, as we see from subsequent proceedings, and from the well known relation of master and slave. The latter, generally speaking, could possess no property, but he was often employed to administer his master's property for his lord's advantage, or was set up in business on capital advanced by his owner, paying him all or a certain share of the profits. The money still was not the slave's, and legally all that a slave acquired by whatsoever means belonged to his master, though custom had sanctioned a more equitable distribution. The "goods" delivered unto the lord's servants represent the special privileges accorded to them - differences of character, opportunities, education, etc., which they do not share in common with all men. This is one point, as above remarked, in which this parable varies from that of the "pounds." In both cases the gifts are figured by money - a medium current and intelligible everywhere on earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-15.htm">Matthew 25:15</a></div><div class="verse">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto one he gave five talents.</span> The talent of silver (taking silver as worth a little over 5s. an ounce) was nearly equivalent to &pound;400 of our money. It is from the use of the word "talents" in this parable that we moderns have derived its common meaning of natural gifts and endowments. The three principal slaves receive a certain amount of property to use for their master's profit. <span class="cmt_word">To every man.</span> To all is given some grace or faculty which they have to employ to the glory of God. "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ "(<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>). No one can justly say he is neglected in this distribution. Whatever natural powers, etc., we possess, and the opportunities of exercising and improving them, are the gift of God, and are delivered to us to be put out to interest. <span class="cmt_word">According to his several ability</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The master apportioned his gifts in accordance with his knowledge of the slaves' capacity for business, and the probability of their rightly employing much or little capital. So God distributes his endowments, not to all alike, but in such proportions as men are able to bear and to profit by. The infinite variety in men's dispositions, intellects, will. opportunities, position, and so on, are all taken into account, and modify and condition their responsibility. <span class="cmt_word">Straightway took his journey</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). Immediately after the distribution he departed, leaving each slave, uncontrolled and undirected, to use the property assigned  to him. So God gives us free will at the same time that he sets before us opportunities of showing our faithfulness. The Lord may be referring primarily to the apostles whom he left immediately after he had bestowed upon them authority and commission. The Revised Version, Westcott and Hort, Nosgen, and others transfer the adverb "straightway" to the beginning of the next verse (omitting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in that verse). It is supposed to be superfluous here. The Vulgate accords with the Received Text; and there seems to be no sufficient reason for accentuating the first slave's activity above that of the second, who was equally faithful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-16.htm">Matthew 25:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went</span>. The one who had received the five talents, the mark of the greatest trust, lost no time, but betook himself to business with zeal and energy. <span class="cmt_word">Traded with the same</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">made gain with them</span>). The verb is applied to husbandry or any work by which profit is obtained. A special method of increasing the allotted sum is mentioned in ver. 27; but here the term is general, and implies only that the slave used the money in some business which would prove to his master's advantage. In other words, he exercised his faculties and powers in his master's service and with a view to his master's interests. <span class="cmt_word">Made</span> [them] <span class="cmt_word">other five talents</span>. The addition "them" is unnecessary. He doubled his principal - "made" being equivalent to "gained." In the parable of the "pounds" we find the same sum increased in different proportions; here we have different sums multiplied in the same proportion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-17.htm">Matthew 25:17</a></div><div class="verse">And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise</span>, etc. The second servant made an equally good use of his smaller capital. It matters not whether our endowments are large or little, we have to use them all in the Lord's service. "To whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>); and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, to whomsoever less is committed, of him less shall be required. The burden is proportioned to the shoulder. We continually observe what to us seem anomalies in the distribution of gifts, but faith sees the hand of God dividing to each severally as he will, and we are confident that God will take account at last not only of the man's ability, but also of his opportunities of exercising the same. "He also" is omitted by Tischendorf, Westcott and Herr, and others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-18.htm">Matthew 25:18</a></div><div class="verse">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that had received one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the one</span> talent). Limited opportunities do not condone neglect. This third servant was as much bound to put out to interest his little capital as the first was his larger means. <span class="cmt_word">Went</span>; <span class="accented">went away.</span> He too was not altogether idle; he in some sort exerted himself, not indeed actually in evil (as the servant in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-48.htm">Matthew 24:48, 49</a>), but yet not practically in his lord's service. <span class="cmt_word">Hid his lord's money.</span> He thought the amount so small, or his master so rich, that it was of no consequence what was done with it; it was not worth the trouble of traffic. So, like all Easterns, he buried the little treasure in the ground, to keep it safe till his lord should ask tot it. recognizing that it was not his own to treat as he liked, but that it still belonged to him who had entrusted it to his care. The man had some special grace, but he never exercised it, never let it shine before men, or bring forth the fruit of good works. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-19.htm">Matthew 25:19</a></div><div class="verse">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After a long time</span>. The interval between Christ's ascension and his second advent (ver. 5) is long in men's view, though Christ can <span class="accented">say</span>, "Lo, I come quickly" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And reckoneth with them</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23</a>). The opportunity of labouring for Christ in the earthly life is ended at death; but the reckoning is reserved for the parousia - the coming of the Lord. The matter in the parable is concerned with the past actions of the servants of Christ (ver. 14); about the final judgment of the rest of the world nothing is here expressly said, though certain inferences must be drawn from analogous proceedings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-20.htm">Matthew 25:20</a></div><div class="verse">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that had received</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">five talents</span>. The slaves appear in the same order as they had come to receive the deposits. The first comes joyfully, showing boldness in his day of judgment (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>), because he has dealt faithfully and diligently, and prospered in his labours. <span class="cmt_word">Thou deliveredst unto me.</span> He rightly acknowledges that all he had came from his lord, and that it was his duty and his pleasure to increase the deposit for his master's benefit. The long delay had not made him careless and negligent; rather, he had used the time profitably, and thereby added greatly to his gains. <span class="cmt_word">I have gained beside them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The two last words are omitted by Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and the Revised Version. If they are not genuine, they are, at any rate, implied in the account of the transaction. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Alia quinque superlucratus sum.</span> The good servant says, <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>, as if he pointed with joy to the augmented wealth of his master. He does not speak boastfully; he does not praise himself for his success; he had simply done his best with the means entrusted to him, and he can speak of the result with real pleasure (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>). So in a religious sense the obligation to improve talents is even more imperative. "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one to profit withal" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>). The grace which he receives he must employ for his own sanctification, as a member of Christ,  for the edification of others, for the interests of God's Church; such work will show that he is worthy of his Lord's trust and faithful in his stewardship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a></div><div class="verse">His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Well done</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">good and faithful servant.</span> He is praised, not for success, but for being "good," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> kind and merciful and honest in exercising the trust for others' benefit; and "faithful," true to his master's interests, not idle or inactive, but keeping one object always before him, steadily aiming at fidelity. Some regard the words as a commendation of the servant's works and faith, but this is not the primary meaning according to the context. <span class="cmt_word">Over a few things.</span> The sum entrusted to him was considerable in itself, but little compared with the riches of his lord, and little in comparison of the reward bestowed upon him. The Greek here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>, the accusative case denoting "extending over," or "as regards." <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">make thee ruler</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">I will set thee</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>) <span class="cmt_word">over many things;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the genitive implying fixed authority over. From being a slave he is raised to the position of master. He is treated according to the principle in <a href="../../par/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much." The spiritual import of this reward is hard to understand, if it is wished to assign to it a definite meaning. It seems to intimate that in the other world Christ's most honoured and faithful followers will have some special work to do for him in guiding and ruling the Church (see on Matthew 19:28; and comp. <a href="../../par/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> Here is seen a marked contrast between the hard life of the slave and the happiness of the master. Literalists find here only a suggestion that the lord invites the servant to attend the feast by which his return home was celebrated. Certainly, the word translated "joy" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) may possibly be rendered "feast," as the LXX. translate <span class="accented">mishteh</span> in <a href="../../par/esther/9-17.htm">Esther 9:17</a>, and a slave's elevation to his master's table would imply or involve his manumission. On the earthly side of the transaction, this and his extended and more dignified office would be sufficient reward for his fidelity. The spiritual signification of the sentence has been variously interpreted. Some find in it only an explanation of the former part of the award, "I will make thee ruler over many things," conveying no further accession of beatitude. But surely this is an inadequate conception of the guerdon. There are plainly two parts to this. One is advancement to more important position; the second is participation in the fulness of joy which the Lord's presence ensures (<a href="../../par/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>), which, possessed entirely by himself, he communicates to his faithful. This comprises all blessedness. And it is noted that the joy is not said to enter into us. That indeed, though a blessing unspeakable, would be an inferior boon, as Augustine says; but we enter into the joy, when it is not measured by our capacity for receiving it, but absorbs us, envelops us, becomes our atmosphere, our life. Commentators quote Leighton's beautiful remark, "It is but little that we can receive here, some drops of joy that enter into us; but there we shall enter into joy, as vessels put into a sea of happiness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-22.htm">Matthew 25:22</a></div><div class="verse">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That had received</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>two talents</span>. This man, who had received a less sum, had been as faithful as the first, and comes with equal confidence and joyfulness to render his account, because he had been true and diligent in furthering his lord's interests to the best of his means and faculties. He had, it seems, less capacity, but had used it to the full. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-23.htm">Matthew 25:23</a></div><div class="verse">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Enter thou,</span> etc. Both these servants had doubled their capital, and the lord commends and rewards them both in the same terms. The point is that each had done his best according to his ability. Their different talents, greater or less, had been profitably employed, and so far the two were equal. Fidelity in a smaller sphere of labour may be of greater importance than in a larger area; and seemingly insignificant duties well performed may be of incalculable spiritual advantage to one's self and to others. Differences in talents make no distinctions in rewards, if the utmost is made of them. "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24</a></div><div class="verse">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He which had received the</span> <span class="cmt_word">one talent.</span> The rest of the parable is concerned with the case of this unprofitable servant. Usually, those who have most privileges neglect or misuse them or some of them; here the man apparently least favoured is taken as the type of the useless and wicked disciple, because his task was easiest, his responsibility less, his neglect most inexcusable. He has heard the words of his two fellow servants, and the great reward which their faithful service has received; he comes with no joy and confidence to render his account; he feels fully how unsatisfactory it is, and beans at once to defend his conduct by proclaiming his view of his lord's character. <span class="cmt_word">I know thee that thou art an hard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man.</span> He chooses to conceive of his lord as harsh, stern, churlish in nature, one without love, who taxes men above their powers, and makes no allowance for imperfect service, however honest. He dares to call this impudent fiction knowledge. Thus men regard God, not as he is, but according to their own perverted  views; they read their own character into their conception of him; as the Lord says, in <a href="../../par/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>, "Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself." <span class="cmt_word">Reaping where thou hast not sown</span> (<span class="accented">thou sowedst not</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and gathering where thou hast not</span> <span class="cmt_word">strawed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">whence thou scatteredst not</span>). This is a proverbial saying, implying a desire of obtaining results without sufficient means. The last verb is interpreted either of sowing or winnowing; the latter seems to be correct here, thus avoiding tautology. It is used by the Septuagint in this sense in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, as the rendering of the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">zarah</span> (Edersheim). So the phrase here signifies gathering corn from a floor where thou didst not winnow. The slave virtually brings a twofold charge against his master, viz. that he enriched himself by others' toil; and that he expected gain from quarters where he had bestowed no labour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-25.htm">Matthew 25:25</a></div><div class="verse">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was afraid</span>. He took as certain the conception which he had formed of his master's character, as harsh, exacting, and unsympathizing, and therefore feared to speculate with his money, or to put it to any use whereby it might be lost or diminished. This is his excuse for negligence. He endeavours to cast the fault from his own shoulders to those of his superior. So evil men persuade themselves that God asks from them more than they can perform, and content themselves by doing nothing; or they consider that their powers and means are their own, to use or not as they like, and that no one can call them to account for the way in which they treat them. <span class="cmt_word">Hid thy talent in the earth</span> (see on ver. 18). Put it away for safety, that it might come to no harm, and not be employed for evil purposes. He recognizes not any duty owed to the giver in the possession of the money, nor the responsibility for work which it imposed. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, there thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is thine;</span> <span class="accented">lo! thou hast thy own.</span> This is sheer insolence; as if he had said, "You cannot complain; I have not stolen or lost your precious money; here it is intact, just as I received it." What a perverse mistaken view of his own position and of God's nature! The talent was given to him, not to bury, but to use and improve for his lord's profit. Hidden away, it was wasted. The time, too, during which he had the talent in his possession was wasted; he had not honestly used it in his master's service, or laboured, as he was bound to do. He ought to have had much more to show than the original endowment. To vaunt that, if he had done no good, at least he had done no harm, is condemnation. He might not thus shirk his responsibility. His answer only aggravated his fault. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-26.htm">Matthew 25:26</a></div><div class="verse">His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wicked and slothful servant.</span> In marked contrast with the commendation, "good and faithful," its vers, 21, 23. He was "wicked," in that he calumniated his master, who really seems to have been ready to acknowledge the least service done to him, and never looked for results beyond a man's ability and opportunities; and he was "slothful," in that he made no effort to improve the one talent entrusted to him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou knewest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), etc. Out of his own mouth he judges him (<a href="../../par/luke/19-22.htm">Luke 19:22</a>). He repeats the slave's words, in which he expressed his notion of his lord's character and practice, and deduces therefrom the inconsistency of his action, without deigning to defend himself from the calumny, except, perhaps, by the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which gives a hypothetical notion to the assumed knowledge. "You knew, you say." Some editors place a mark of interrogation at the end of the clause, which seems unnecessary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-27.htm">Matthew 25:27</a></div><div class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou oughtest therefore,</span> etc. Your conception of my character ought to have made you more diligent and scrupulous; and if you were really afraid to rust any risks with my money or invest it in any hazardous speculation, there were many ordinary and safe methods of employing it which would have yielded some profit, and some of these you would have adopted had you been faithful and earnest. The return might have been trifling in amount, but the lord shows that he is not grasping and harsh by being willing to accept even this in token of the servant's labour. <span class="cmt_word">To have put</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>). The term means to have thrown the money, as it were, on the banker's table.

These money changers or bankers (for the business seems always to have combined the two branches) were a numerous class in Palestine, and wherever the Jewish community was established. They received deposits at interest, and engaged in transactions such as are usual in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">With usury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="accented">with interest</span>). At one time, law had forbidden usurious transactions between Israelites, though the Gentile was left to the mercy of his creditor (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19, 20</a>); but later such limitations were not observed. The rate of interest varied from four to forty per cent. The spiritual interpretation of this feature of the parable has most unnecessarily exercised the ingenuity of commentators. Some see in the bankers an adumbration of the religious societies and charitable institutions, by means of which persons can indirectly do some work for Christ, though unable personally to  undertake such enterprises. Olshausen and Trench regard them as the stronger characters who, by example and guidance, lead the timid and hesitating to employ their gifts aright. But it is more reasonable to consider this detail of the parable as supplementary to its chief purpose, and not to be pressed in the interpretation. The Lord is simply concerned to show that all talents, great or small, must be used in his service according to opportunities; and that, whether the return be large or little, it is equally acceptable, if it show a willing mind and real fidelity in the agent. In illustration he uses two cases which yield most profit, and one which produces the least. Nothing can he inferred hence concerning the morality of usury. Christ draws his picture from the world as he finds it, pronouncing no opinion on its ethical bearing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a></div><div class="verse">Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The sentence on the unprofitable servant follows.

It was given to him for a special purpose; he had not carried this out; therefore it could be his no longer. A limb unused loses its powers; grace unemployed is withdrawn. God's Spirit will not always strive with man. There comes a time when, if wilfully resisted and not exercised, it ceases to inspire and to influence. Well may we pray, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from us!" <span class="cmt_word">Give it,</span> etc. This is done on the principle stated in the next verse and <a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>. God's work must be done; his gifts are not lost; they are transferred to another who has proved himself worthy of such a charge. As the servant who had the ten talents lied already brought in his account and had received his reward, it seems, at first, difficult to understand how additional work and responsibility should be given to him. But it is the blessedness of Christ's servants that they rejoice in a new trust received, in added opportunities of serving him, whether in this life or in the life to come, and all the increase which they make is their own eternally and augments their joy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a></div><div class="verse">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto every one that hath...  abundance</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>). So we have seen in the first part of the parable. The proverb says, "Money makes money;" a man who has capital finds various means of increasing it; it grows as it is judiciously employed. Thus the grace of God, duly stirred up and exercised, receives continual accession, "grace for grace" (<a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>). The Christian's spiritual forces are developed by being properly directed; Providence puts in his way added opportunities, and as he uses these he is more and more strengthened and replenished. <span class="cmt_word">From him that hath not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). So the Received Text, probably from <a href="../../par/luke/19-26.htm">Luke 19:26</a>; the best manuscripts and editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">but as to him that hath nat</span>; this, followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> at the end of the verse, is less tautological than the other reading. To "have not," in accordance with the context, signifies to possess nothing of any consequence, to be comparatively destitute, in the world's estimate of riches. Shall be taken away even that which he hath; <span class="accented">even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.</span> The Vulgate, following some few manuscripts, has, <span class="accented">Et quod videtur habere auferetur ab eo</span>, from <a href="../../par/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a>. The poor unpractical man shall lose even the little which he possessed. So the spiritually unprofitable shall be punished by utter deprivation of the grace which was given for his advancement in holiness. If applied to the special circumstances of the time and of the persons to whom it was addressed, the parable would teach that the disciples who recognized and duly employed the riches of the doctrine and powers delivered unto them would receive further revelations; but that the people who spurned the offered salvation and neglected the gracious opportunity would forfeit the blessing, and be condemned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a></div><div class="verse">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast ye the unprofitable servant into</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>outer darkness</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>). The parable merges into the real. The 'matter represented bursts through the veil under which it was delivered, and stands forth plainly and awfully. The command is issued to the ministers of the Lord's vengeance, whether earthly or angelic. The slave was truly unprofitable, as he advanced neither his master's interests nor his own, which were bound up with the other. While the faithful servants enter into the joy of the Lord, he is rejected from his presence, expelled from the kingdom of heaven, banished we know not whither. And why? Not for great ill doing, sacrilege, crime, offence against the common laws of God and man; but for neglect, idleness, omission of duty. This is a very fearful thought. Men endeavour to screen themselves from blame by minimizing their talents, ability, opportunities; this parable unveils the flimsiness of this pretence, shows that all have responsibilities, and are answerable for the use they make of the graces and faculties, be they never so small, which they possess. Spiritual indolence is as serious a sin as active wickedness, and meets with similar punishment, Our Lord's account of the last judgment terribly confirms this truth (vers. 42-45). <span class="cmt_word">There shall</span>  <span class="cmt_word">be</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>weeping and</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>gnashing of teeth</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>). "There," viz. in the outer darkness. The remembrance of lost opportunities, wasted graces, bartered privileges, will fill the mind of the banished with terrible remorse, and make existence a very hell; and what more shall be added? Some of the Fathers have recorded a gnomic saying derived from this parable, if not an utterance of our Lord himself, "Be ye approved bankers." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a></div><div class="verse">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The final judgment on all the nations.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) Before entering upon the exposition of this majestic section, which is a prophecy, not a parable, we have to settle the preliminary question as to who are the subjects of the judgment here so graphically and fearfully delineated. Are they only the heathen, or Christians, or all mankind without exception? The Lord's present utterance is plainly the development of the account of the parousia in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 3</a>l. There those that are gathered are "the elect," nothing being said concerning the rest of mankind; here we have the forecast completed, both righteous and unrighteous receiving their sentence. "All the nations" usually represent all Gentiles distinguished from the Jews. But there is nothing to indicate separate judgment for the Jew and Gentile. Equally unlikely is the notion that the transaction is confined to the heathen, whether the opinion is grounded on a supposed extension of the mercies of Christ to those ignorant of him, but having lived according to the laws of natural religion; or whether it assumes as certain that believers will not be judged at all (an erroneous deduction from <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). It seems, on the one hand, incongruous that persons who have never heard of Christ should be addressed as "blessed of my Father," etc., ver. 34: and it seems, on the other hand, monstrous that such, having failed through ignorance and lack of teaching, should be condemned to awful punishment. That Christians alone are the persons who are thus assembled for judgment is not likely. Is there, then, to be no inquisition held on the life and Character of non-Christians? Are they wholly to escape the great assize? If not, where else does Christ refer to their case? What reason can be given for the exclusion of this great majority from the account of the proceedings at the last day? It appears, on the whole, to be safest to consider "all the nations" as meaning the whole race of men, who, dead and living, small and great, Jew and Gentile, shall stand before God to be judged according to their works (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-13</a>). This is not a parable, but a statement of future proceedings by him who himself shall conduct them. It is not a full account of details, but an indication of the kind of criteria which shall govern the verdicts given. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, <span class="accented">but when</span>). The particle, unnoticed in the Authorized Version, indicates the distinction between this section and the preceding parables, the latter exemplifying the judgment specially on Christians, this setting forth the judgment on the whole world. <span class="cmt_word">Son of man.</span> With his glorified body, such as he was seen at his Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In his glory.</span> The term occurs twice in this verse, as elsewhere (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, where see notes) denoting that then his humiliation will have passed away, and he will appear as he is. <span class="cmt_word">All the holy angels with him.</span> "Holy" is probably a transcriber's addition, which has crept into the later text. The Vulgate omits it. At this time all the family of heaven and earth shall be assembled (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>). Of angels and men none shall be wanting. "Omnes angeli, omnes nationes. Quanta celebritas!" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Then shall he sit, etc</span>. He shall take his seat as Judge on his glorious throne trey. 20:11), surrounded by the angels and the saints (<a href="../../par/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>). Observe, this was spoken three days before his death (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53, 64</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a></div><div class="verse">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be gathered</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).

The criteria upon which the judgment proceeds, in the following verses, seem to imply that all men have the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-10.htm">Mark 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). How this can apply to those who died before the incarnation of Christ and the consequent evangelization of the world, we know not, though we may believe that, ere the end comes, Christ will have been preached in every quarter of the globe. That some process of enlightenment goes on in the unseen world we learn from the mysterious passage, <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>; but we have no reason to suppose that probation is extended to the  other life, or that souls will there have the offer of accepting or repelling the claims of Jesus (but see <a href="../../par/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>). By describing mankind as "all the nations," Christ shows the minute particularity of the judgment, which will enter into distinctions of country, race, etc., and while it is universal will be strictly impartial. He is the Shepherd of all mankind, whether considered as sheep or goats, and can therefore distinguish and class them perfectly. Those who have never heard of Christ (if such there shall be) can be tried only by the standard of natural religion (<a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall separate them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>).

This judicial distinction between the right and left hands is found in classical writers. Thus Plato, 'De Republica,' 10:13, tells of what a certain man, who revived after a cataleptic attack, saw when his soul left his body. he came to a mysterious place, where were two chasms in the earth, and two openings in the heavens opposite to them, and the judges of the dead sat between these. And when they gave judgment, they commanded the just to go on the right hand, and upwards through the heavens; but the unjust they sent to the left, and downwards; and both the just and unjust had upon them the marks of what they had done in the body. So Virgil makes the Elysian Fields to lie on the right of the palace of Dis, and the penal Tartarus on the left ('AEn.,' 6:540, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When the division is made, the sentences are pronounced. At death a separation between good and evil is in some sort made, as we learn by the parable of Dives and Lazarus; but the final award is not given till the great day. <span class="cmt_word">The King.</span> He who had called himself the Son of man, here for the first and only time in Scripture names himself the King (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11</a>).

He calls them to be by his side, to share his kingdom and glory (<a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>). Ancient commentators have tenderly expanded this invitation, conceiving it addressed individually to patriarch, prophet, apostle, martyr, saint; others have paraphrased it in affecting terms: "Come from darkness to light, from bondage to the liberty of God's children, from about to perpetual rest, from war to peace, from death to life, from the company of the evil to the fellowship of angels, from conflict to triumph, from daily temptation and trial to stable and eternal felicity." <span class="cmt_word">Ye blessed of</span> (equivalent to by) <span class="cmt_word">my Father.</span> So <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "taught of [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by] God" (<a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). They were beloved by God, and were to be rewarded by the gift of eternal life. This was their blessing (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). Nothing is said about election or predestination, as if they were saved because they were blessed by the Father. There is a sense in which this is true; but they were rewarded, not because of their election, but because they used the grace given to them, and cooperated with the Holy Spirit which they received. <span class="cmt_word">Inherit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">receive as your lot</span>).

'For, before you were,' saith he, 'these things had been prepared, and made ready for you, forasmuch as I knew you would be such as you are '" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). Christians are by baptism made in heritors of the kingdom of heaven, gifted with heavenly citizenship, which, duly used, leads to eternal glory. "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the foundation of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">a constitutione mundi</span>).

The two expressions virtually correspond, implying God's eternal purpose, "who willeth that  all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a></div><div class="verse">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. Jesus here gives the reason which influences him in conferring this great boon on "the sheep" of his flock. He instances certain works of mercy which they performed during their earthly pilgrimage, as examples of the kind of acts which he deems worthy of eternal reward. It is not that he regards no other with favour, but these six works, as they show the temper and virtue of the door, are taken as the type of those which are approved. They are proofs of self-denial, pity, sympathy, charity; they demonstrate that the doer has something of God in him, that according to his lights he possesses and has exercised the supreme grace of love. The Lord confined himself to one detail; he does not disparage other requirements necessary for salvation, as faith, prayer, sacraments, chastity, truth, honesty; but he looks on one particular class of works as the great result of all the aids and provocatives offered by his Spirit, and herein sets forth the principle by which judgment is guided, and which can be applied universally. The Judge asks not what we have felt or thought, but what we have done or left undone in our dealings with others. "It is plain," says Bishop Bull ('Harm. Ap.,' diss. 1:5. 4), "that our works are considered as the very things on account of which (by the merciful covenant of God through Christ) eternal lifo is given us." He quotes Vossius ('De Bon. Op.,' 10): "It is asked whether a reward is promised to works as signs of faith? Now, we conceive they say too much who suppose it promised to works as deserving it, and that they say too little who think it promised to them only as signs of faith. For there are many passages of Scripture where it is shown that our works, in the business of salvation, are regarded as indispensably requisite, or as a primary condition, to which the reward of eternal life is inseparably connected." <span class="cmt_word">I was an hungred,</span> equivalent to "very hungry" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>). Christ enumerates the chief of what are called the corporal works of mercy, omitting burial of the dead (see on ver. 36). We may note here an argument <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>: if such simple acts (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>) meet with so great a reward, what shall he the portion of those who are enabled to rise to more perfect obedience and higher degrees of devotion and self-sacrifice? <span class="cmt_word">Ye took me in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into your houses, received me with hospitality, or as one of your own family.

Why Christ speaks of himself as receiving these ministrations is explained in ver. 40. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a></div><div class="verse">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye visited me.</span> The visitation of the sick has become a common term among us. It implies properly going to see, though other ideas are connoted. <span class="cmt_word">Ye came unto me.</span> It was easier in those days to visit friends in prison than it is at the present time. Good men, if they could not obtain release of prisoners, might comfort and sympathize with them. The seven corporal works of mercy which antiquity has endorsed have been preserved in the mnemonic line, "Visito, poto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo, condo. All these might be performed by non-Christians who professed the fear of God and followed the guidance of conscience. God never leaves himself without witness; his Spirit strives with man, and in the absence of higher and completer revelation, to be wholly guided by these inner motions is to work out salvation, as far as circumstances allow, and in a certain restricted sense. In a universal judgment regard is had to this consideration. "In return for what do they receive such things? For the covering of a roof, for a garment, for bread, for cold water, for visiting, for going into the prison. For indeed in every case it is for what is needed; and sometimes not even for that. For surely the sick and he that is in bonds seek not for this only, but the one to be loosed, the other to be delivered from his infirmity. But he, being gracious, requires only what is within our power, or rather even less than what is within our power, leaving to us to exert our generosity in doing more" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

Their reply (which is given before the Lord's explanation) is contained in three verses, which recapitulate the deeds specified by the Lord, with some slight variation in the wording. <span class="cmt_word">When saw we thee,</span> etc.? If this reply is conceived as spoken by the followers of Christ, who most be supposed to know what he had said (ch. 10:40-42, "He that receiveth you receiveth me," etc.), it must be considered as expressive, not so much of surprise, as profound humility, which had never hitherto realized the grand idea. They had done so little, they had rendered him no service personally, they were unworthy so to do - how could they merit such a reward? If the answer is taken as given by non-Christians, it shows ignorance of the high value of their service, and astonishment that, in following the dictates of conscience and charity, they had unwittingly had the supreme honour of serving Christ. Mediaeval legends have exemplified the identity of Christ and his suffering members by telling how saints  have seen him in those whom they relieved.

"God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.

To the poignant regret for the loss of happiness and of the presence of God there is added physical anguish, expressed metaphorically by the term "fire."

There is no hint of its being remedial or corrective; and what it is to the devil it must be to those who share it with him. It is man's own doing that he is unfit for the company of saints and angels, and, having made himself like unto the evil spirits by rebellion and hatred of good, he must consort with them and share their doom. It seems as though there were no proper place for man's punishment; there is no book of death corresponding to the book of life (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, etc.); the wicked are in an anomalous state, and, shut out by their own action from their proper inheritance, fall into the society of demons. How to reconcile this destiny, which seems inconceivably terrible, with God's mercy, love, and justice, has always proved a stumbling block to free thinkers. It is, indeed, a mystery which we cannot understand, and which Christ has purposely left unexplained. We can only bow the head and say, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).

The crimes for which these souls are punished are those of omission and negligence; they failed to per form the most elementary duties of charity and brotherly love which conscience and natural religion enjoin; they had lived utterly selfish and unprofitable lives. If sins of omission are thus punished, we may infer that positive transgressions shall meet with still heavier retribution.

They put all these neglected duties in a careless summary. They had never thought of Christ in the matter: were they to be  condemned for this?

The same term is used in both places, and ought to have been so translated. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in strict classical usage denotes punishment inflicted for the correction and improvement of the offender, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x391;</span> being employed to signify punishment in satisfaction of outraged justice, or to revenge an injury. But it is open to doubt whether the former term is to be taken in its strictest sense in the New Testament. A ceaseless controversy rests on the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, some contending that it signifies "everlasting," and nothing else; others that its sense is modified by the idea to which it is attached; and others again that it ought to be rendered by "aeonian," to which is given an indeterminate signification governed by our conception of the duration expressed by men. This is not the place to discuss this perplexing question, nor shall I attempt to dogmatize upon the problem. Suffice it to make these few observations. On the one hand, taking the literal sense of our Lord's words, and the meaning which his hearers would attach to them, we must believe that the risen life and the second death are equally everlasting (see Judith 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17; 4 Macc. 12:12). And if it is thought that eternity of punishment is incompatible with love and benevolence, and inequitable as the penalty of offences committed in time, it must be remembered that eternity of reward is infinitely beyond all human claims, and bears no proportion to the merits of the recipient. Nor may we reason from our conception of the nature and attributes of God; how these attributes work harmoniously together, though seemingly opposed, we cannot presume to determine. The consequences of sin even in this world are often irretrievable, as are some human punishments. We have no reason to suppose that punishment is inflicted only for the correction of the criminal (see on ver. 41), nor is it possible to conceive how this result could be effected by condemning him to the society of devils. Further, we have to regard the heinousness of sin in God's sight, remembering the infinite price paid for its expiation. And lastly, the doctrine does not depend upon this passage only, but is supported by many other statements in both the Old and New Testaments: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44, 46, 48</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. Such are some of the chief arguments in favour of the everlasting nature of future punishment. On the other hand, we have to remark that our Lord is here not concerned with teaching this doctrine of eternity; he assumes the authorized view of the matter, and draws his awful lesson from that view. It is certainly true that the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not fixed and uniform; it is conditioned by the term to which it appertains. No one would say that "everlasting" was applied to God and to a mountain in the same sense; and though it seems incongruous to find a difference of meaning in the same sentence, yet there may be reasons for distinguishing the signification of the qualifying adjective in the terms "eternal life" and "eternal punishment." God, indeed, cannot draw back from his promise, but he may be more merciful than the tenor of his threats seems to imply. It is possible that "aeonian" may denote merely indefinite duration without the connotation of never ending. Such like are the pleas brought forward to lessen the plain enunciation of the awful truth. For myself I do not see any escape from the import of the statement, nor any hope of amelioration in the case of the lest, when relegated to the scene of their penal existence (see on Matthew 18:8, 9). But I set no bounds to the Divine mercy and wisdom; and God may see a mode of reconciling his strict justice with his desire of man's salvation, which our finite understanding cannot grasp. All we can say here is that infinite misery and infinite happiness are set before us, and that God has thus shown the two ends without reserve or possible modification, in order that we may be aroused to shun the one and to win the other.

The rulers well knew the stern temper of Pilate the procurator, who was prepared to crush any popular movement with the strong hand, and at festival times had always his soldiers ready to hurl upon the mob at the slightest provication, and to deal indiscriminate slaughter. Hence arose the plan of a clandestine apprehension. It was, indeed, the custom to execute great criminals at the time of the chief festivals, in order to impress the spectacle of retribution upon the greatest number; but in the case of Jesus, after what had occurred during the last few days, and when Jerusalem was filled with Galilaeans, who might naturally favour their countryman's pretensions, it was deemed dangerous to make any open attack. Their fears were relieved in the most unexpected manner by the appearance of Judas among them (ver. 14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The anointing at Bethany.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-8</a>.) This parenthetical episode is introduced by the two synoptists out of its chronological order, with the view of indicating the immediate cause of Judas's resolution to betray his Master, the issue of which they proceed to narrate (see on ver. 14). This anointing must not be confounded with that related by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, etc.), where the scene, the time, and the actor were different, and the significance was of a very inferior nature. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus was in Bethany.</span> St. John tells us that the incident took place six days before the Passover, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday. It is St. Matthew's custom to describe events not always in their historical sequence, but according to some logical or spiritual connection which in his mind overrides considerations of time or place. (For Bethany, see on Matthew 21:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Simon the leper</span>. Not that he was a leper now, but either the appellation was hereditary, in reference to some such malady inflicted on his family, or he himself, having been cured by Christ, retained the name in memory of his cleansing. So St. Matthew is called "the publican" after he had relinquished his obnoxious business (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>), and the revived man is termed "the dead" (<a href="../../par/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>). The frequency of the name Simon among the Jews rendered the addition of a surname expedient; thus we have Simon the Cananite, Simon the tanner, Simon Bar-john, etc. Nothing certain is known about this person. Tradition makes him father of Lazarus or husband of Martha. That he was connected with the holy family of Bethany, either by relationship or close friendship, seems to be well established. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> St. John identifies her as Mary the sister of Lazarus and Martha. Why the synoptists omit her name is not known; it is equally uncertain why St. John makes no mention of Simon. None of the synoptists notice Lazarus, though St. Luke names Martha and Mary (<a href="../../par/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38, 39</a>). It may have been at the  time a matter of prudence or delicacy not to draw attention to them by name. But there is no discrepancy. One narrative supplements the other, and it is best to be thankful for what we have, and not to be over curious concerning points not explained. <span class="cmt_word">An alabaster box</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). A cruse or flask made of alabaster, which is a white calcareous spar resembling marble, but setter and more easily worked. These cruses were generally round shaped, with a long narrow neck, the orifice of which was sealed. It may be the breaking of this seal to which St. Mark refers in his account (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>), when he says that "she brake the box." <span class="cmt_word">Very precious ointment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). St. Mark calls it "pistic nard," rendered in our version "spikenard." The word in our text seems to be used for any salve or ointment which contained myrrh as one of its ingredients. Nard is found in Syria, the Himalayas, and other parts of India. From its root a strong scented unguent was made, which, being imported from a long distance, was very costly. <span class="cmt_word">Poured it on his head.</span> It is to be noted that in the original there is no "it" after "poured;" so there is nothing to imply that the whole was poured upon his head. This helps to reconcile this account with that of the fourth evangelist (Morison). St. John tells that she anointed his feet, which was unusual; she first anointed his head, and then his feet, wiping the latter with her long flowing hair. Anointing the head was not an uncommon way of honouring distinguished guests; but Mary had another thought in her mind which the Lord discerned (ver. 12<span class="cmt_word">). As he sat</span> at meat; <span class="accented">as he reclined at table.</span> The Jews had adopted the Roman mode of eating (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a>, where the word rendered "guests" is "the recumbent"). St. Matthew does not mention that a special supper was arranged for him (<a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>), as if to do him honour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When his disciples saw it.</span> St. John states that the objection came originally from Judas. Doubtless, when it was once made, many concurred in it, not, indeed, from Judas's selfish motive (<a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), but because they did not clearly apprehend the Divinity of Christ, nor the unspeakable sacredness of that body which was about to be the instrument of man's redemption. <span class="cmt_word">To what purpose is this waste</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)pw/leia</span>)?

A fitting question truly for him to ask! The objectors saw no practical usefulness in the expenditure of this costly substance. If it was thought proper to show respect to their Master, a much inferior oil would have equally effected this purpose, or a few drops of the more precious unguent would have sufficed. So nowadays one hears complaints of money being expended in the rich decoration of churches, etc., when there are starving multitudes whom it would have relieved. But God himself has sanctioned the use of precious materials and of exquisite workmanship in temples built in his honour, and in the accessories of his public worship; the interests of the poor are not overlooked in such expenditure; they who give of their substance for such purposes are just those who feel all their responsibilities, and know that they serve Christ in ministering to his needy members.

When we remember that one denarius represented the daily wages of a labouring man (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>), we see that the cost was very large. <span class="cmt_word">Given to the poor.</span> And this "much" given to the poor. But piety is not shown only in giving alms; the honour of God has a superior claim. And Mary was rich, and quite able to afford this offering without neglecting her almsgiving. "How often does charity serve as a cloak for covetousness! We must not neglect what we owe to Jesus Christ under pretence of what we owe his members. Men count as wasted what is expended in the outer worship of God, when they love neither God nor his worship. Jesus Christ authorizes it by accepting it at the very instant in which he was establishing religion by a worship the most spiritual and inward" (Quesnel).

Doubtless, their remarks had reached Mary's ears, and annoyed and embarrassed her. <span class="cmt_word">For she hath wrought a good work upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. A work that proved her zeal, reverence, and faith. Mary had always been devout, contemplative, loving. She had learned much at the grave of Lazarus; she was full of gratitude at the wonderful restoration of her brother's life; she had often heard Christ speak of his decease, and knew that it was close at ham], realizing that which the chosen apostles were still slow to believe; so she was minded to make this costly offering. And Christ saw her motive, and graciously accepted it.

This was in  strict accordance with the old Law: "The poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy in thy land" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>).

When he speaks of being with his Church always to the end, he is speaking of his Divine presence. His human body, his body of humiliation, was removed from the sight and touch of men, and he could no longer be received and welcomed and succoured as heretofore. In a different and far more effectual mode he would visit his faithful servants by a spiritual presence which should never fail or be withdrawn. To the objectors he would say, "You will no longer have opportunity of honouring me in my human form; why, then, do you grudge the homage now paid me for the last time?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-12.htm">Matthew 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On my body, she did it for my burial</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">to prepare me for burial</span>).

She desired to offer what she could (<a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>) of the offices and attentions due to the corpse of a beloved and revered Friend. Christ interpreted her act, and gave it a solemn significance. By this effusion of the precious unguent site anticipated the embalming of the Lord's body; she showed her reverence for that body which was to be given for the life of the world not many days hence. The full meaning of the mystery of which she was the instrument Mary did not comprehend, but what she had consciously done received a wonderful commendation from the Lord, which has no parallel in the Gospel history.

"Who then proclaimed if, and caused it to be spread abroad? It was the power of him who is speaking these words. And while of countless kings and generals the noble exploits, even of those whose memorials remain, have sunk into silence; and having overthrown cities, and encompassed them with walls, and set up trophies, and enslaved many nations, they are not known so much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up statues, and established laws; yet that a woman who was a harlot poured out oil in the house of some leper, in the presence of ten men, - this all men celebrate throughout the world; and so great a time has passed, and yet the memory of that which was done hath not faded away, but alike Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the race or the Moors, and they that inhabit the British Islands, spread abroad that which was done secretly in a house by a woman" ('Ham. 80. in Matthew'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Compact of Judas with the Jewish authorities to betray Jesus.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-10.htm">Mark 14:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-6</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. The time referred to is the close of Christ's addresses, and <span class="cmt_word">the</span> assembling of the Jewish authorities mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, vers. 6-13 being parenthetical. It is reasonable to suppose that the loss of the three hundred denarii, at which he would have had the handling, and the reproof then administered, gave the final impulse to the treachery of Judas. This seems to be signified by the synoptists' introduction of the transaction at Bethany immediately before the account of Judas's infamous bargain (see preliminary note on vers. 6-13). <span class="cmt_word">One of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot.</span> That he was one of the twelve, the chosen companions of Christ, emphasizes his crime, makes it more amazing and more heinous. To witness the daily life of Christ, to behold his miracles of mercy, to listen to his heavenly teaching, to hear his stern denunciations of such sins as covetousness and hypocrisy, and in spite of all to bargain with his bitterest enemies for his betrayal, reveals a depth of perverse wickedness which is simply appalling. Well may the evangelist say that Satan entered into Judas (<a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>); it was the devil's work he was doing; he followed this evil inspiration, and thought not whither it would lead him. <span class="cmt_word">Went unto the chief priests.</span> Their hostility was no secret. Judas and everybody knew of their hatred of Jesus, and of their attempts to get him into their power; he saw his way to  carrying out his purpose, and making of it some pecuniary gain. We are not to suppose that this miserable man sank all at once to this depth of iniquity. <span class="accented">Nemo repente fit turpissimus</span>. Though the descent to Avernus be easy, it is gradual; it has its steps and pauses, its allurements and checks. Modern criticism has endeavoured to minimize the crime of Judas, or even to regard him as a hero misunderstood; but the facts are entirely in favour of the traditional view. We can trace the path by which the apostle developed into the traitor, by studying the hints which the Gospels afford. He was probably at first fairly sincere in attaching himself to Christ's company. Being a man of business capacity and skill in the management of money matters, he was appointed treasurer of the little funds at the disposal of Christ and his followers. Half-hearted and self-seeking, his undertaking this office was a snare to which he easily fell a victim. He began by petty peculations, which were not discovered by his comrades (<a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), though he must often have felt an uneasy apprehension that his Master saw through him, and that many of his warnings were directed at him (see <a href="../../par/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64, 70, 71</a>). This feeling lessened the love for Jesus, though it did not drive him to open apostasy. He had admitted the demon of covetousness to his breast, and he now adhered to Christ for the hope of satisfying greed and worldly ambition. The teaching and miracles of Christ had no marked influence on such a disposition, softened not his hard heart, effected no change in his evil and selfish desires. And when he saw his hopes disappointed, when he heard Christ's announcement of his speedy death, which his knowledge of the rulers' animosity rendered only too certain, his only feeling was hatred and disgust. The transient expectations raised by the triumphal entry were not fulfilled; there was no assumption of the earthly conqueror's part, there were no rewards for Christ's followers, nothing but enmity and threatening danger on every side. Judas, seeing all this, perceiving that no worldly advantage would be gained by fidelity to the losing side, determined to make what profit he could under present circumstances. Not with the mistaken idea of forcing Christ to declare himself, and to put himself at the head of a popular movement, nor with any notion of Christ miraculously saving himself from his enemies' hands, but simply from sordid love of gain, he made his infamous offer to the chief priests. It was just when they were in perplexity, and had determined on nothing except that the arrest and the condemnation were not to take place during the feast, that Judas was introduced into the assembly. No wonder "they were glad" (<a href="../../par/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a>); here was a solution of the contemplated difficulty; they need have no fear of a rising in favour of Christ; if among his chosen followers some were disaffected, and one was ready to betray him, they might work their will, when he was once quietly apprehended, without any danger of rescue and disturbance (see on Matthew 27:3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a></div><div class="verse">And said <i>unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?

Thirty shekels of the sanctuary, equivalent to &pound;3 15s. of our money. This was the legal price of a slave gored by an ox (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>), and must have been considered by the traitor but a poor reward for his crime. He found the rulers as covetous as himself, and disposed to treat both him and his Master with the utmost contempt. Christ had taken upon him the form of a bondservant, and was here reckoned as such. The transaction had been typically shadowed forth when another Judas sold his brother Joseph for twenty pieces of silver (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27, 28</a>); when Ahithophel gave counsel against David, his familiar friend (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16.htm">2 Samuel 16</a>.); and when Zechariah wrote, "I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed [<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint] for my price thirty pieces of silver" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12</a>). St. Matthew alone of the evangelists mentions the exact price agreed upon. It may have come naturally to the "publican" to observe the pecuniary aspect of the transaction.

The festival actually began at sunset of the 14th which was called the day of preparation, because the lambs for the feast were slain in the afternoon of that day, preparatory to their being eaten before the morning of the 15th. Domestic preparation, involving the removal of all leaven from houses and the use of unleavened bread, began on the 13th; hence this was considered at this era "the first day of the Unleavened." <span class="cmt_word">Came to Jesus.</span> As the Master of the family, who had the ordering of all the details of the Paschal celebration.

Bethany was considered as Jerusalem for the purposes of the solemn meal, and the apostles thought that preparation was to be made at some house in that village. <span class="cmt_word">Prepare for thee to eat the Passover</span>. The preparations were numerous: a proper room had to be found and swept and carefully cleansed from every particle of leaven; tables and couches had to be arranged, lights to be supplied, the lamb and all other necessaries (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> bread, wine, bitter herbs) provided. All these preparations took much time, so it was doubtless in the early morning that the disciples applied to our Lord. When they spoke of eating the Passover, they doubtless supposed that Christ meant in due course to celebrate the regular Paschal supper on the appointed day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the evening of Friday.

The other synoptists mention certain signs by which they were to recognize the man. At the entrance of the city they would meet a man bearing a pitcher of water; they were to follow him to the house whither he went, and then give their message to the master of the house. There is a great similarity between this mission and that concerning the ass before the triumphal entry. The foreknowledge and the precision in directions are quite analogous. The "good man" was doubtless a disciple, though at this festival all strangers were freely received by any householder who had accommodation. Dr. Edersheim supposes that he was father of Mark, who was the "young man" arrested by the company that took Jesus (<a href="../../par/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>). The secrecy observed in the above-mentioned arrangement was intended to keep the knowledge from Judas, and thus to secure immunity from interruption at the solemn meal. The traitor seems to have sneaked out from the last Supper, and disclosed Christ's retreat to the Jewish authorities, and conducted them to the house; but, finding that Jesus had left the room, he led them to Gethsemane, whither he knew that Jesus often resorted (<a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Master.</span> A disciple would know who was meant by this title (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>).

But the expression was mysterious and indefinite. <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">keep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, I <span class="accented">keep</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Passover at thy house.</span> The Passover which the Lord was to keep was not the usual Paschal meal, as the lamb could not be legally killed till the 14th, but a commemorative anticipatory feast in which he himself was the Lamb - "the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." Of that Lamb the apostles did mystically eat when Christ gave them the bread and wine with the words, "This is my body;" "This is my blood." This Supper, which was virtually the new Passover, seems traditionally to have become confounded with the usual Paschal solemnity; hence the language of the synoptists assumes a form which is applicable to the regular Jewish feast. This explanation, if it seems to derogate somewhat from the precise verbal accuracy of the evangelists, would probably be confirmed if we were better acquainted with the customs then prevalent, and with the current meaning of the language employed. The ambiguity in the accounts may be divinely intended to call attention to the fact that the last Supper was not the Jewish Passover, but the Christian Passover - not the sacrifice on the cross, but an anticipation thereof. We may observe in passing that there is no mention of the lamb in the celebration; Peter and John were not enjoined to provide one, nor are they said to have visited the temple - which, indeed, on the 13th would have been useless: and yet to obtain the lamb in any other way would have been a breach of the Law, which we cannot suppose Christ would sanction. We may also notice that the word "feast" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>) is nowhere applied to the last Supper, though  it is always employed in reference to the Jewish solemnity. St. Paul, in his account of the institution of the Holy Communion (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>.) makes no mention of any Paschal solemnities or associations, but merely states that it was appointed on the night in which Jesus was betrayed. <span class="cmt_word">With my disciples;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the twelve apostles; none but these, not even the master of the house, were present at this solemn scene.

They got the room ready, provided unfermented bread, wine, bitter herbs, sauce, and some dishes necessary for the feast. They would not eat the Paschal lamb at the legal time tomorrow, so the Lord ordained a commemorative and anticipatory solemnity, in which he appointed a rite which should take the place of the Jewish ceremony. We learn from the other synoptists that the householder was not satisfied with offering Christ and his friends the use of the common hall, which they would have had to share probably with other guests; but he assigned to them his best and most honourable chamber, "a large upper room," already properly arranged and furnished for the feast. Tradition has maintained that this apartment was that afterwards used by the apostles as a place of assembling, and where they received the effusion of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost.

The rule that obtained concerning the number in one company of partakers of the Paschal feast was that it never should be less than ten, nor more than the lamb would suffice to feed, though a morsel of the flesh was considered to satisfy all requirements. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-21.htm">Matthew 26:21</a></div><div class="verse">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they did eat.</span> The details of the Paschal feast are expounded by rabbinical authors, though there is little in St. Matthew's account to lead us to conclude that our Lord observed them on this occasion. The ceremonial usually practised was as follows: The head of the family, sitting in the place of honour, took a cup of wine and water mixed ("the first cup"), pronounced a thanksgiving over it, and, having tasted it, passed it round to the guests; the master washed his hands, the others performing their ablutions at a later part of the service; the dishes were placed on the table; after a special benediction had been spoken over the bitter herbs, the master and the rest of the company took a bunch of these, dipped it in the appointed sauce, and ate it; an unleavened cake was broken and elevated with a prescribed formula; the second cup was filled, the history of the festival was proclaimed, <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>, were recited, and the cup was drunk. Now began the proper Paschal meal with a general washing of hands; the lamb was cut into pieces, anda portion given to each, with a bit of the unleavened bread and bitter herbs dipped in the sauce, called by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>) "the sop." At the end of the meal, which was supplemented by other viands (which, however, were probably eaten before the lamb), the third cup, named by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>) "the cup of blessing," was drunk, and the solemn grace after meat was uttered. It would be necessary to examine St. John's Gospel to see how the ritual fitted into the actual details of the last Supper; we have to deal with St. Matthew's account. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Christ thus prepares the apostles for the incredible statement which he is about to make. <span class="cmt_word">One of you;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

He had before spoken vaguely of his betrayal (see <a href="../../par/matthew/17-22.htm">Matthew 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a>). By thus showing his knowledge of the coming treachery, and yet declining to denounce the traitor by name, he may have given Judas a last chance of repentance before the final act. St. Matthew omits the washing of the disciples' feet, and the strife about pre-eminence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-22.htm">Matthew 26:22</a></div><div class="verse">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceeding sorrowful.</span> Such an announcement filled them with amazement and grief; they scarcely dared suspect one another, but began to doubt their own constancy, though at the time conscious of their integrity. <span class="cmt_word">Is it I?</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">Numquid ego sum? It is not I, is it?</span> where the negative answer is expected. It is remarkable that the real character of Judas had never been discovered by the fellow disciples who for three years had mixed with him in closest companionship. Either he was a consummate hypocrite, or the other apostles were too simple-minded, good, and charitable to think evil of any one. Thus his peculations passed unnoticed, and the greed and. avarice which wrecked his spiritual life were entirely unsuspected. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a></div><div class="verse">And he answered and said, He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that dippeth</span> (<span class="accented">dipped</span>) <span class="cmt_word">his hand with me in the dish.</span> Even now Jesus does not identify the traitor. Many had put their hands into the dish along with  Christ. Judas was one of those who had done so. The fact of eating together made in the Easterns' view, the treachery more monstrous. "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me" (<a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). The dish was one of large dimensions, from which each guest took his portion with his fingers. It was truly a common meal in which all shared. Our Lord's words were spoken in answer to John's question, "Lord, who is it?" (John xii[. 25). The beloved apostle's position at table, "lying on Jesus' breast," enabled him to ask this without being overheard. There is a mistake commonly made concerning the shape of the table used on such occasions. It was not of a horseshoe form, but oblong. The couches were arranged round three of its sides, and it extended a little way beyond the divans. The Master's seat was not at the top or middle couch, but at the side; and from what occurred we should infer that John sat on the right of Jesus at the end of the couch, and Judas on the left of Jesus, the strife about precedency having been thus settled. (The correct shape of the table, and the places of Jesus, John, Judas, and Peter, are delineated in Edersheim's work, vol. 2. p. 494.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a></div><div class="verse">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Son of man goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">departeth</span>).

"The prescience of God," says Chrysostom, "is not the cause of men's wickedness, nor does it involve any necessity of it; Judas was not a traitor because God foresaw it, but he foresaw it because Judas would be so." <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto that man by</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom the Son of man is betrayed!</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x2e;</span> Judas could hear this and the following sentence, and yet retain his iniquitous purpose! <span class="cmt_word">It had been good for that man if he had not been born;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it were good for him if that man had not been born.</span> Jesus says this, knowing what the fate of Judas would be in the other world. There is no hope here held out of alleviation or end of suffering, or of ultimate restoration. It is a rayless darkness of despair. Had there been any expectation of relief or of recovery of God's favour, existence would be a blessing even to the worst of sinners; for they would have eternity still before them in which to enjoy their pardon and purification; and in such case it could not be said of them that it were better for them never to have been born. On one side of the mysterious problem connected with Judas and such-like sinners we may again quote St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 81, in Matthew'), "'What, then,' one may say, 'though Judas had not betrayed him, would not another have betrayed him?...  Because if Christ must needs be crucified, it must be by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such a person as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had been impeded.' Not so. For the All wise knows how he shall bring about our benefits, even had this happened. For his wisdom is rich in contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no one might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, he declares the wretchedness of that man. But some one will say again, 'And if it had been good if he had never been born, wherefore did he suffer both this man and all the wicked to come into the world?' When thou oughtest to blame the wicked, for that, having the power not to become such as they are, they have become wicked, thou leavest this, and busiest thyself and art curious about the things of God, although knowing that it is not by necessity that any one is wicked." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?

Judas probably had not been one of those who put this question before, and now, availing himself of his proximity to Jesus (see on ver. 23), he has the inconceivable effrontery to make this inquiry privately, as if to assure himself whether Christ was conscious of his treachery or not. It is remarked that he does not call Jesus "Lord," as the other apostles, but "Rabbi," a coldly ceremonious title (so in the garden, ver. 49) The gentle Jeans reproaches him not, but answers him in low tones unheard by the rest (<a href="../../par/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said.</span> A common formula, equivalent to "yes."

The endless controversies which have gathered round the Holy Eucharist, for opposite views of the meaning and purpose of which men have fearlessly met death, render it a difficult matter to expound the text succinctly and yet with due regard to clearness and precision. If I do not expatiate upon the diverse opinions which have been held on this momentous subject, it is not because I have neglected to weigh and examine them, but because it is more conducive to edification to have a plain statement of what appears to the writer to be the truth, than to  confuse a reader with a multitude of interpretations which in the end have virtually to be surrendered. The points to be specially remembered before trying to expound the section are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He who institutes the ordinance is Almighty God made man, who is able to set aside one observance and to substitute another in its place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The new ordinance had an analogy with that which it superseded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It was intended to be the one great service and means of grace for all Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The interpretation is to he connected with the great discourse of Jesus in the sixth chapter of St. John, where Christ speaks of himself as the Bread of life that came down from heaven, and his flesh and blood as the nourishment of his people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they were eating.</span> Before the supper was quite ended, and before the third cup of wine (see on ver. 21) was drunk. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus took bread</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the bread</span>, according to the Received Text). The special unleavened cake prepared for the Paschal meal. The four accounts agree in this detail, and seem to indicate a formal action or elevation, like the wave offering in the old Law. We see here the "High Priest after the order of Melchizedek" bringing forth bread and wine like his great prototype (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>), and by anticipation offering himself as victim. <span class="cmt_word">And blessed it.</span> The Received Text here and in St. Mark has <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which in some manuscripts has been altered to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, in conformity with the wording in St. Luke's and St. Paul's accounts. We find a similar interchange of the words in the miracles of the loaves (see <a href="../../par/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-6.htm">Mark 8:6</a>, etc.). Virtually, the two expressions are identical; the thanksgiving is a blessing, the blessing is a thanksgiving. The usual blessing uttered by the master over the unleavened cake is said to have been, "Blessed be he who giveth the bread of earth." From this benediction on the elements, and the thankful remembrance of Christ's death and the benefits thereof herein connoted, the Holy Communion has from the earliest times been called the Holy Eucharist. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it.</span> The fraction of the bread was so important and essential a part of the institution, that it gave its name to the whole rite, and "breaking of bread" represented the cele bration of the Holy Eucharist, the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>, etc.). Under the old Law the fraction represented the sufferings endured by the chosen people; in Christ's new institution it symbolized his death, when his feet and hands were pierced with the nails and his side with the spear. <span class="cmt_word">Gave it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">was giving</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the disciples.</span> He gave to each of them a portion of the cake in their hand. If they had risen from their couches at the solemn benediction, as we may well suppose they did, they were still standing when the Lord distributed the consecrated bread. That they received it reclining in an easy posture seems unlikely. <span class="cmt_word">Take</span> (<span class="accented">ye</span>), <span class="cmt_word">eat</span> (ye). The two words are given only in our Gospel; St. Mark has "take ye" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being there an interpolation). St. Luke and St. Paul omit them altogether. We should infer that Christ did not himself partake of the bread or wine (which would have confused the deep significance of the ordinance), but gave it to his apostles, that by such participation they might be identified with the sacrifice represented by the broken bread, thus transforming the Levitical rite into a new sacrament which did not merely commemorate his death, but conveyed its benefits to faithful receivers. <span class="cmt_word">This is my body.</span> "This" in the Greek is neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), and therefore is not in agreement with "bread" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), which is masculine. It is to be explained as "This which I give you, this which ye receive." The copula "is" would not be expressed in the Aramaic, which Christ spoke; and yet what a world of controversy has hung on this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>! Some take it as absolutely identifying subject and predicate; others regard it as equivalent to "represents;" others, again, would modify it in some manner, so that it should not logically express the agreement of the two terms of the proposition. It was doubtless a startling statement to those who then heard it for the first time, but it came upon them not wholly unprepared. In his momentous discourse on the Bread of life, after the feeding of the five thousand, Jesus had spoken of himself as the Food of his people, and then proceeded to make the amazing assertion, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you" (<a href="../../par/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53</a>). The meaning of this mysterious warning was not further explained. Now as the Lord distributed to the apostles the blessed morsels with those solemn words, they learned what he meant by eating his flesh and drinking his blood, how he put it in his servants' power to fulfil the injunction. In what sense could "this" be his body? He was there before their eyes in human form, perfect Man; and yet he gives something else, not that which was standing before them, as his body. Stupendous mystery, past finding out! There is no room here for metaphor or figure. He is not figuratively describing himself or his office or his work, as when he calls himself the good Shepherd, the Door, the Vine, the  Way: he directs attention to one part of his nature, his body, and that as toed to be eaten. He shows the mode by which we may be participators of this his lower nature, that as, joined to Adam, we die, so thus united to Christ, we live. We must, as before observed, remember that he who said these words was God incarnate, and that he designed to give his Church a means of realizing and receiving those stupendous blessings set forth in his Eucharistic discourse as depending upon due reception of his body and blood. It is obvious that the apostles could not understand the terms literally, but, believing in his Godhead, believing that he could bring to pass that which he said, they apprehended them in a supernatural, mystical sense; they had faith to know that in these holy elements, blessed by their Lord, they received him, ate his flesh and blood, to their soul's health. This was no mere commemorative rite, not simply a way of remembering Christ's death and Passion, but it was a sacrament, an outward sign of an inward reality, something from without entering the recipients and imparting to them that which before they had not. How the outward and inward are joined together we cannot tell. It is, and will always remain, an unfathomable mystery. The presence of Christ's humanity in the Holy Communion is beyond, above, the ordinary conditions of man's nature; it is supernatural, miraculous, even as was his incarnation, which joined manhood and Deity. The substance, indeed, of the elements remains as before, their nature is not changed, but they have a new relation and use and office; they serve as a means of communicating Christ's body and blood, and they are so called before reception, so that the receiver's faith does not make them to. be such, but Christ's own word with power. Attempts to explain this Divine matter hopelessly fail. Hence the Romanist with his transubstantiation, or change of substance; the Lutheran with his consubstantiation, or confusion of substance; the Zuinglian with his irreverent virtualism, alike fall into error and depart from pure doctrine. The only right attitude is to leave all such efforts alone, to believe Christ's word simply but wholly, and to use the sacrament in full faith, that by and through it to the faithful recipient are imparted incalculable benefits. To the words, "<span class="accented">This</span> is <span class="accented">my body</span>," St. Luke adds, "which is being given (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) for you;" and St. Paul, "which is [broken;? genuine] for you." Thus the Lord, before he actually suffered, offered himself as a Victim voluntarily undergoing death, and showed it forth by the broken bread and the poured wine. We are told that the master of the household, when he distributed the pieces of the lamb, said solemnly, "This is the body of the Paschal lamb." Christ transformed this formula to a new use, but in neither case did it introduce a mere symbol of something absent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a></div><div class="verse">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He took the cup</span>. Many good manuscripts have "a cup," and some modern editors omit the article; but this cup was the only one on the table at the time; so the reading matters not. This was probably the third cup at the close of the Paschal meal (see on ver. 21). The wine of the country is what we call a red wine (compare "the blood of grapes," <a href="../../par/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>); it was mixed with a little water when used at the table. This third cup was termed "the cup of blessing" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>), because over it was spoken a special benediction, and it was regarded as the principal cup, following, as it did, the eating of the lamb. <span class="cmt_word">Gave thanks</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The thanksgiving was a blessing (see on ver. 26). The celebration of Christ's death and the remembrance of the incalculable blessings obtained thereby may well be termed the Holy Eucharist, the great sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) it <span class="cmt_word">to them.</span> The aorist here used would imply strictly that he gave the cup once for all, herein differentiating the action from that employed in distributing the bread. St. Luke's expression, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves," refers to an earlier stage of the supper. In the present connection he nearly agrees with the other synoptists. It is possible that the cup was passed from hand to hand after it had been blessed by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Drink ye all of it.</span> St Mark adds, "And they all drank of it." Strange it is that, with these words written in the Scripture, any Church should have the hardihood to deny the cup to any qualified Christian. The Romanist's assertion that the cup is for priests alone, as it was given to the apostles only, and was destined for them and their sacerdotal successors, would apply equally to the consecrated bread, and then what becomes of the <span class="accented">general</span> use of the ordinance? If we would have life in us, we must not only eat Christ's flesh, but drink his blood. We need to be refreshed as well as strengthened in the battle of life, and it may well be that the mutilation of the sacrament carries with it spiritual effects that impede the soul's health.

The evangelical covenant supersedes the Judaic, even as the sacrifice of Christ fulfils and supersedes the Levitical sacrifices. <span class="cmt_word">Which is shed</span> (<span class="accented">is being shed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for many</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">effundetur</span>, in reference to the crucifixion of the morrow; but this is tampering with the text. Rather, by using the present tense, the Lord signifies that his death is certain - that the sacrifice has already begun, that the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>) was now offering the eternal sacrifice. The whole ordinance is significant of the completion of the atonement. "Many" here is equivalent to "all." Redemption is universal, though all men do not accept the offer (see on ch. 20:28). Even Calvin says, "Non partem mundi tantum designat, sed totum humanum genus." <span class="cmt_word">For the remission of sins.</span> "For without shedding of blood is no remission" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>); "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). The sacrifices of the Law, the blood of bulls and goats, could not take away sin; at most they gave a ritual and ceremonial purification. But what the Mosaic Law could not effect was accomplished by the precious blood of Christ, who offered himself a spotless and perfect Victim unto God. This is our Lord's most complete announcement of the propitiatory nature of his sacrifice, which is appropriated by faith in the reception of his precious blood. St. Paul adds, "This do ye (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me [<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, 'for my commemoration']." These were, of course, Christ's words spoken at the time, and are of most important bearing on what is called the sacrificial aspect of the Holy Eucharist.

From this moment forward he tastes not the cup. It does not follow that he had partaken of the consecrated wine which he gave his apostles. Probability is against his having done so (see on ver. 26). He used the same words with the first cup at the commencement of the supper (<a href="../../par/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>). Of this he probably partook, but not of the latter. The offspring of the vine is a poetical way of describing wine (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>, etc.). It is absurd to find in this term an argument for unalcoholic grape juice. Wine, to be wine, must undergo fermentation, and if it is not to putrefy or to become vinegar, it must develop alcohol. <span class="cmt_word">When I drink it new</span> (<span class="greek_word">kaino/n</span>) <span class="cmt_word">with you in my</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father's kingdom.</span> This mysterious announcement has been variously interpreted, and its meaning must remain uncertain. Some refer it to Christ's intercourse with his disciples after he rose from the dead, when <span class="accented">e.g.</span> he partook of food with them (<a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30, 42, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). But this seems hardly to meet the requirements of the text, though it has the support of Chrysostom, who writes, "Because he had discoursed with them concerning Passion and cross, he again introduces what he has to say of his resurrection, having made mention of a kingdom before them, and by this term calling his own resurrection. And wherefore did be drink after he was risen again? Lest the grosser sort might suppose that the resurrection was a phantasy To show, therefore, that they should see him manifestly risen again, and that he should be with them once more, and that they themselves shall be witness to the things that are done, both by sight and by act, he saith, 'until I drink it new with you,' you bearing witness. But what is 'new'? In a new, that is, in a strange manner, not having a passible body, but now immortal and incorruptible, and not needing food." Some explain it of the Passover, of which he then partook for the last time, the type being fulfilled in him. The solution does not explain the new participation in the kingdom of God. It seems, on the whole, best to understand it as a prophecy of the great marriage supper of the Lamb, and the joys that await the faithful in the new heavens and the new earth. The wine is (he token of the felicities of this dispensation, and it is called "new" in contrast with the obsolete character of that which it superseded. "Novitatem dicit plane eingularem" (Bengel).

The "then" of St. Matthew must not be taken strictly as denoting exact chronological sequence, but as marking a change of scene or a new incident. <span class="cmt_word">All ye shall be offended because of me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">in me</span>). There is an emphasis on "all ye;" even ye eleven, who have been steadfast hitherto. One, Judas, had already departed; but Christ warns the eleven that they too shall for a time lose their faith in him, and sin by forsaking their Lord. His apprehension and trial would prove a rock of offence to them. <span class="cmt_word">It is written.</span> In <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, where the prophet's words are, "Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and against the Man that is my Fellow, saith the Lord of hosts; smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered." It is here shown that all that happened took place according to "the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God." That Christ may be the Saviour he must be a sacrifice. In Zechariah the Lord gives the command to the sword; hence Christ can say, <span class="cmt_word">I will smite. The</span> Shepherd is Christ, the sheep are the disciples, who, at the sight of the officers coming to seize him, "all forsook him, and fled" (ver. 56). The prophecy in Zechariah is remarkably full of references to Christ, his nature and his position.

The apostles, or many of them, after the Resurrection, returned to their old homes in Galilee, but Christ preceded them, and they found him there before them (<a href="../../par/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21.htm">John 21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>). He again gathered around him his little flock lately scattered. True, he had then already appeared to them at Jerusalem more than once; but this was, as it were, fortuitously and unexpectedly. The meeting in Galilee was by appointment, and of most solemn import, Christ then reuniting the apostolic body, and renewing the apostolic commission (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>).

This self-confident answer seems to have been made after he had received the warning recorded by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>), "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat; but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not."

The addition of "men" in the Authorized Version alters the intended meaning. Peter contrasts himself with his fellow disciples. Though they all should fall away, he, at any rate, would remain steadfast. He could not endure to be included in the "all ye" of Jesus' warning (ver. 31); and as for failing "this night," he will never at any time (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) be offended in Christ. Commenting on his offence, St. Chrysostom says, "The matters of blame were two: both that he gainsaid Christ, and that he set himself before others; or, rather, a third, too, namely, that he attributed all to himself." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Peter's boast elicits a crushing reply from his Lord, foretelling the special sin of which he would be guilty, and the very time of the night when it should be committed. <span class="cmt_word">This night, before the cock crow.</span> The word "cock" is without the article, so the meaning may be "before a cock crow;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably before midnight. Cocks were unclean birds, and not kept by strict Jews, and their voice was not much heard in Jerusalem; though it is quite different now, where barn door fowls swarm round every house. One of the night watches, that about 3 a.m., was known as "cock-crow" (see <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>). Some think this is what is meant here. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> What Peter denied was that he knew anything of Christ, or had ever been his follower (see vers. 69-75; <a href="../../par/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>).

Christ's explanation of his meaning only drew from Peter a more energetic asseveration of his constancy even unto death. "He thought he was able," says St. Augustine, "because he felt that he wished." The other apostles made a similar assertion, and Jesus said no more, leaving time to prove the truth of his sad foreboding.

Jesus retired thither for privacy and for prayer in anticipation of what was coming. St. John explains, "Where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples." This so called garden was situated a short distance from the bridge over the Kedron, at the foot of the Mount of Olives. It was a plantation of olives; and there are many of these trees, some of great age, still growing in the neighbourhood. The fanciful idea that some of these witnessed the agony of our Lord has no support whatever. In the first place, olive trees do not live two thousand years; and, secondly, it is certain that in the sieges of Jerusalem all surrounding trees were ruthlessly destroyed; and lastly, the exact site of this terrible scene is unknown, though tradition has fixed upon a certain spot now enclosed with walls, and containing a building known by the name of "The Chapel of the Sweat." <span class="cmt_word">The disciples.</span> Eight of them - Judas having long ago departed - and three Jesus took with him deeper into the dim recesses of the wood. <span class="cmt_word">Sit ye here.</span> Remain here, at the entrance to the olive yard.

Their present faith and love were not equal to the strain. <span class="cmt_word">Go and pray yonder.</span> One is reminded of Abraham at Mount Moriah, when he says to the attendants, "Abide ye here, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>). When the Lord says "here" and "yonder," he points to the spots indicated. He always retired to pray, even as he tells his followers to enter into their closets when they put up their supplications to their Father in heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a></div><div class="verse">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter and the two sons of Zebedee.</span> These three had been privileged to behold his transfiguration, and that glimpse of his glory strengthened them to bear the partial sight of their dear Lord's sufferings.

This word seems to be used of the dismay that comes with an unexpected calamity. St. Mark tells us that Christ was "sore amazed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It is as though the prospect of what was coming suddenly opened to his vision and overwhelmed him. He now set before himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his human consciousness, the sufferings which he had to undergo, with all that led to them, and all that would follow, and the burden was crushing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death</span> (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a>). Christ speaks here of the mental agony which he is enduring; he bides not from the faithful three that which weighs upon his heart, so excessive a strain that human nature must fail to endure it. We cannot gauge the anguish; we may suggest some of the causes of this sorrow. It was not merely the thought of bodily pain, though that would be long and excessive; there were other elements which made his sorrow like to no other sorrow. He thought of all the circumstances that led to his Passion; all that would accompany it; all that would succeed it - the malice and perversity of the Jews, the grievous wickedness that brought about his death, the treachery of Judas, the desertion of his friends, the denial of Peter, his unjust condemnation at the hands of the rulers of the chosen nation, the pusillanimity of Pilate, the guilt of the actors in the tragedy, the wilful iniquity of those whom he came to redeem, the ruin which they brought on themselves, their city and nation - such considerations formed one ingredient in the bitter cup which he had to drain. And then the thought of death was unspeakably terrible to the all-holy Son of God. We men become accustomed to the thought of death. It accompanies us through all our life; it looms before us always. But man was created immortal (Wisd. 2:23), his nature shrinks from the dissolution of soul and body; and to the sinless, unfallen Man this experience was wholly unknown and awful. Here was the incarnate God, the God-Man, submitting himself to the punishment of sin, tasting death forevery man, bearing in his own Person the inexpressible bitterness of this penal humiliation. Added to all this was the incalculable fact that "the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all." The burden of the sins of all mankind he bore on his sacred shoulders. "Him who knew no sin God made to be sin on our behalf" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). What this mysterious imputation, so to speak, involved, we cannot tell; but to a being perfectly pure and holy it must have been anguish unspeakable. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry ye here.</span> As ver. 36, "Sit ye here." <span class="cmt_word">And watch with me.</span> In his dark hour his human soul yearned for the comfort of a friendly presence; even though these chosen three might not witness the extremity of his agony, their proximity and sympathy and prayers were a support. But he bade them watch for their own sake also. Their great trial was close at hand; they were about to be tempted to deny and forsake him; they could resist only by prayer and watchfulness (ver. 41).

In this terrible crisis there is no resource but prayer. The shadow of death enveloped him, wave and storm rolled over his soul; yet out of the deep he called unto the Lord. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7, 8</a>) some affecting details are added, "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered." <span class="cmt_word">O my Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The personal pronoun is omitted in some manuscripts, but it has high authority. Only on this occasion and in his great prayer (<a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) does Christ so address the Father, his human nature in the depth of suffering retaining still the sense of this paternity. St. Mark has, "Abba, Father," as if he spake for the Hebrew race and the Gentile world. <span class="cmt_word">If it be possible;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if there is any other way in which man may be saved and thou be glorified; if there is any other mode of redemption. It is the cry of humanity, yet conditioned by perfect submission. <span class="cmt_word">Let this cup pass from me.</span> The "cup" is the bitter agony of his Passion and death, with all their grievous accompaniments (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>, and note there). All heroism and manly endurance in the face of pain and death Christ exhibited to the full; but the elements of suffering in his case were different, and fraught with exquisite torture (see above, on ver. 28). Such was the anguish that it would have then separated soul and body - of such rigour that "his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground" - had not an angel appeared from heaven to strengthen and support the fainting human life (<a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> In this prayer are shown the two wills of Christ, the human and Divine. The natural shrinking of the human soul from ignominy and torture is overborne by entire submission to and compliance with the Divine purpose. So it is said that the Captain of our salvation was made perfect through sufferings, learned obedience by the things which he suffered (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>) By this passage the Monophysite and Monothelite heresies are clearly refuted, the two natures and two wills of Christ being plainly displayed. The three apostles saw only some part of their Master's intense agony, and heard only some broken utterances of his supplication; hence there are some slight variations in the synoptical accounts. St. Mark doubtless derived his account immediately from St Peter; the other synoptists from some other source. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a></div><div class="verse">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh unto the disciples</span>. He rose from prayer and returned to his three apostles, seeking their sympathy and the comfort of their presence in his lonely desolation. <span class="cmt_word">Findeth them asleep;</span> <span class="accented">sleeping.</span> The comfort which his man's nature craved was denied him. St. Luke, the physician, says that the disciples were "sleeping for sorrow." Some great mental shock, some poignant distress, often produces a bodily stupor and sleep; but this is scarcely a valid excuse for such insensibility at this terrible crisis, especially as the Lord had urged them to watch (ver. 38). They had had a very trying day; Peter and John had undergone much bodily fatigue in preparing the last Supper; they were all weary, full of grief, and weighed down by foreboding; it was no wonder that they succumbed to these influences, though we might have expected that such as they would have risen superior to them. "The simple law, that extraordinary tension raises the highly developed spiritual life, while it stupefies the less developed, finds here its strongest illustration in the almost absolute contrast of spiritual watchfulness and sleep" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">Saith unto Peter.</span> Peter had been most forward in profession (vers. 33, 35); so Christ addresses him first. The other two, James and John, bad boldly asserted that they were able to drink of Christ's cup of suffering (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>); so they are included in the tender reproach. <span class="cmt_word">What</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>could ye not watch with me?</span> <span class="accented">So, could ye not</span>, etc.? Is it so that? Are ye unable to do even this little thing for me? Truly a pathetic reproof! <span class="cmt_word">One hour</span>. It may be that this first stage of the agony had lasted for an hour, but the term is more probably indefinite; or it may refer to the whole time of trial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a></div><div class="verse">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Watch</span> (<span class="accented">ye</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and</span> pray. A summary of Christian duty. Watchfulness <span class="accented">sees</span> temptation coming; prayer gives strength to withstand it. The apostles needed the injunction at this moment; for their great trial was close at hand. <span class="cmt_word">That ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">enter not</span> (<span class="accented">in order that ye may not eater</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into temptation.</span> The phrase is usually interpreted to mean either to fall into temptation, to be tempted, or to run wilfully into temptation; but it seems to be better, with Grotius, to  take it in the sense of succumbing to, falling under, being vanquished by temptation, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>, "immergi et succumbere." That Peter and the rest were now to be tempted was certain (<a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31, 32</a>), and it was too late to deprecate the trial; but it was right and expedient to ask of God grace to withstand in the evil hour. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> This was an added motive for vigilance and prayer. The apostles had shown a certain readiness of spirit when they offered to die with Christ (ver. 35); but the flesh, the material and lower nature, represses the higher impulse, checks the will, and prevents it from carrying out that which it is prompted to perform (see the action of these contrariant forces noticed by St. Paul, <a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>.). "For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things" (Wisd. 9:15). Our Lord at this very time was experiencing and exemplifying the truth of his saying, though in his ease the weakness of the flesh was entirely overmastered by the willing spirit. It is noted that Polycarp quotes this maxim of Christ in his 'Epistle to the Philippians,' ch. 7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-42.htm">Matthew 26:42</a></div><div class="verse">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again the second time.</span> A pleonastic expression, as in <a href="../../par/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a>, etc., calling especial attention to "the numerical re-repetition of the Saviour's prayer" (Morison). St. Matthew alone gives the words of this second prayer, which differs in some respects from the first. The possibility of the cup passing away was considered no longer; the continuance of the trial showed that it was not to he. <span class="cmt_word">If this cup may</span> (<span class="accented">can</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>not pass away from me...  thy will be done.</span> He accepts the cup; his human will coincides with the Divine will; he acquiesces with perfect self-resignation. The cup, relatively to the circumstances, could not pass away from the Saviour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-43.htm">Matthew 26:43</a></div><div class="verse">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came and found them asleep (</span><span class="accented">sleeping</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>again</span>. In the best manuscripts "again" is connected with the verb "came." This was his second visit; he was still craving for their sympathy, still desirous of their safety under temptation. <span class="cmt_word">Heavy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Weighed down with drowsiness; St. Mark adds, "Neither wist they what to answer him." He partially aroused them, but they were too overcome with sleep to enter fully into the situation or to attend to the obvious duty before them.

Three times he prayed, and his prayer was always of the same import - teaching us by example to be urgent, instant, in supplication, and, though the special request be denied, to be sure that we are heard and that an answer will be given; even as Christ obtained not the withdrawal of the cup, but strength to submit, endure, and conquer. We must compare this threefold prayer and contest with the threefold temptation at the beginning of our Lord's ministry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cometh he.</span> St. Hilary comments on these three visits: "On his first return he reproves, on the second he holds his peace, on the third he bids to rest." The contest was over; the human will was now entirely one with the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Sleep on now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">henceforward</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and take your rest.</span> This is probably to be understood literally. There was a short interval still before the apprehension and the subsequent events; as they could not watch, they might use this in finishing their sleep, and recruiting their wearied bodies in preparation for the coming trial. Many expositors find an irony in Christ's words, taken in connection with those that follow, as if he meant, "In a few minutes I shall be seized; sleep on if you can; you will soon be miserably awakened, make the most of the present." But at this moment the tender Jesus would surely never have condescended to address his friends in such a style. All his words and actions were animated with the deepest love for them and anxiety on their account. A change to irony is really inconceivable under the circumstances. Nor is there any reason to take the sentence interrogatively, "Sleep ye at such a moment?" It is more simple to regard the words as said <span class="accented">bona fide</span>, with no mental reservation and no implied censure. We may suppose that a pause ensued before the utterance of the next clause, and that the Lord allowed his fatigued followers to sleep on till the last moment. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the hour is at hand, and</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">when</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Son of man is betrayed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">is being betrayed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into the hands of sinners.</span> He calls all simmers who take part in his apprehension, trial, and death - not the Romans only (as <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), but priests, eiders, multitude, who joined in the crowd and incurred the guilt. There is now no sign of wavering; he is ready, yea, eager to meet the sufferings which he foresees.

Came. St. Luke tells us that he led the way to Gethsemane. He well knew the place as a favourite resort of Christ (<a href="../../par/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>); he knew, too, that Jesus was alone there with his apostles, and he had gone with confidence to inform the authorities where they could find him, and to demand a force sufficient to make the arrest. <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude.</span> Consisting of some of the Levitical guard, Roman soldiers, Sanhedrists, and elders.

Probably these did not know Jesus by sight; at any rate, amid the crowd he might easily escape detection; it was also night, and even the Paschal moon might not enable the guards to distinguish faces under the shade of the dark olive grove. <span class="cmt_word">Whomsoever I</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall kiss.</span> In the East such salutation was common among friends, masters, and pupils; and it would awaken no surprise to see Judas thus salute his Teacher. Perhaps he desired to save appearances in the eyes of his fellow disciples. We marvel at the audacity and obduracy of one who could employ this mark of affection and respect to signal an act of the blackest treachery. <span class="cmt_word">That same is he</span> whom you have to arrest. <span class="cmt_word">Hold him fast.</span> As if he feared an attempt at rescue, or that Jesus might, as before (<a href="../../par/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>), use his miraculous power to effect his escape. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a></div><div class="verse">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forthwith</span>.

Judas was more than usually demonstrative in his salutation. "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords" (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). So Joab treated Amasa before he murdered him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9, 10</a>). What infinite patience for the Lord to submit to this hypocritical caress! It is a type of the wonderful goodness and long suffering of God towards sinners, how he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Friend</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">companion</span> (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-13.htm">Matthew 20:13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>). The word seems, in the New Testament, to be always addressed to the evil, though in itself an expression of affection. Here Christ uses no reproach; to the last he endeavours by kindness andlove to win the traitor to a better mind. St. Luke narrates that Jesus called him by name, saying, "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Wherefore art thou come?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Received Text gives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, which has very inferior authority. There is great difficulty in giving an exact interpretation of this clause. The Authorized Version, as the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Ad quid venisti?</span>), takes it interrogatively; but such a use of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span> is unknown. If it is interrogative, we must understand, "Is it this for which thou art come?" But Christ knew too well the purport of Judas's arrival to put such an unnecessary question. Others explain, "Do that, or, I know that for which thou art come." Alford, Farrar, and others consider the sentence as unfinished, the concluding member being suppressed by an aposiopesis consequent on the agitation of the Speaker, "That errand on which thou hast come - <span class="accented">complete."</span> More probably the clause is an exclamation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> being equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in later Greek, "For what a purpose art thou here!" It is, indeed, a last remonstrance and appeal to the conscience of the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Took him.</span> They seized him with their hands, but did not bind him till afterwards (<a href="../../par/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). Whether Judas had any latent hope or expectation that Jesus at this supreme moment would assert and justify his Messiahship, we know not. The histories give no hint of any such idea, and it is most improbable that the apostate was thus influenced (see on ver. 14). We must here introduce the incident recorded by St. John (John 18:4-9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of them which were with Jesus.</span> St. John names Peter as the agent in the attack on the high priest's servant; he also alone gives the name of the servant, Malchus. Of the circumstances which led to the subsequent miracle all the evangelists give an account; the miracle itself is related only by St. Luke. Conjecture has attempted to give reasons for these deficiencies in some of the narratives, and the complementary details in others; but it is wisest to say that thus it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost who guided the writers, and there to leave the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Drew his sword.</span> The apostles had evidently misunderstood the Lord's words uttered a little while before (<a href="../../par/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36-38</a>), "He that hath no sword, let him sell his cloke, and  buy one." Two of them had then exhibited the weapons with which they had armed themselves, as if ready to repel violence And now one of these, thinking that the hour was arrived for striking a blow in his Master's defence, resorted to violence. Physical courage, indeed, Peter possessed, as was proved by his attitude in the face of fearful odds, but of moral courage he and his comrades exhibited little evidence, when, as soon as their Master was apprehended and led away, they "all forsook him, and fled" (ver. 56). <span class="cmt_word">Struck a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant of the high</span> <span class="cmt_word">priest's.</span> The man was the high priest's servant in a special way - what we should call his bodyservant; he had evidently made himself conspicuous in the arrest, and Peter struck fiercely at his head as the foremost of the aggressors. St. John, who was acquainted with the high priest and his household, gives his name as Malchus, a Syriac word, meaning "Counsellor." <span class="cmt_word">Smote off his ear.</span> The blow fell short, but inflicted a serious wound. How the mischief was repaired by the healing touch of Christ is mentioned alone by Luke the physician, for whom the incident would have special interest. We may note, in passing, that this miracle (the last which Christ worked before his death) was wholly unsolicited and unexpected on the part of the recipient, and was performed upon an enemy actually engaged in hostility. What more striking proof of the Lord's mercy and forgiveness could have been given? What better way could there be of demonstrating the nature of the kingdom which he came to establish? Thus he displayed his superhuman power even while surrendering himself to captivity and death. By this immediate action too he secured his followers from reprisal, so that they were allowed to retire unmolested, and Peter, though recognized to have been one of those in the garden (<a href="../../par/john/18-26.htm">John 18:26</a>), was not punished for his part in the transaction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put up again thy sword into his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>place.</span> Christ orders Peter to sheathe his sword; but the wording is peculiar, <span class="accented">Turn away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">thy sword</span>; as if Christ would say, "The sword is none of mine; the arm of flesh and the carnal weapon are thine; turn off thy sword from the use which thou art making of it to its proper destination, to be wielded only at God's command." Then he gives a motive for this injunction. <span class="cmt_word">For all they that take</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> There is a stress on the word "take," and there is an imperative force in the future, "shall perish." The Lord is speaking of those who arbitrarily and presumptuously resort to violence; and he says, "Let them feel the sword." The word was of wide application, and contained a universal truth; it was, in fact, a re-enactment of the primaeval law touching the sacredness of human life, and the penalty that ensues on its infringement (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5, 6</a>). It enforced also the general lesson that violence and revenge effect no good end, and bring their own punishment. There is no prophecy here (as some suppose) of the destruction of the Jews at the hands of the Romans; nor is Christ intent on soothing Peter by the thought of the future retribution which awaited the enemies whom he was so eager to chastise. Such suggestions are arbitrary and unwarranted by the context. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a></div><div class="verse">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thinkest thou that I cannot now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">pray to</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">beseech</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my Father?</span> Jesus proceeds to show that he needs not Peter's puny assistance. <span class="greek">&#x397;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">An putas? Or thinkest thou?</span> The particle, neglected by the Authorized Version, marks the transition to a new motive. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> has the special meaning of "to summon with authority," "to call upon as an ally." Peter needed still to learn the lesson of Christ's Divinity, his oneness with the Father; and this is furnished by the right interpretation of this word, which was not, as our version seems to make it, the cry of an inferior to one mightier than himself, but the summons of an equal to his great Ally in heaven. So Jesus virtually says, "Have I not power through my own Godhead to summon my Father to support me?" (Sewell, 'Microscope of the New Testament'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall presently give me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The Authorized Version seems to have read <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> twice, "now...  presently." The manuscripts show it only once, but vary its position. It most probably belongs to the first clause. The verb rendered "give" has a more pregnant meaning. It is a military term meaning "to place by the side," "to post on one's flank." Hence the Lord implies that at a word the serried ranks of angels would range themselves at his side, true flank comrades, to defend and support him. <span class="cmt_word">Twelve legions of angels.</span> Not a dozen weak men. He employs the Roman term "legion" with intention. He had been arrested by a cohort (<a href="../../par/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3, 12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the tenth part of the legion, which numbered six thousand men; he could, it he chose, call to his aid twelve times six thousand angels, who would deliver their Lord from his enemies. If there was to be an appeal to force, which Peter's rash assault suggested, what could withstand his angelic allies, the heavenly hosts, infinitely more numerous, better disciplined, more effectively officered, prompt and happy to do the will of the great Commander?

In what way, Christ asks, shall God's determined counsel be accomplished, if you turn to the arm of the flesh, or if I use my Divine power to save myself? The will of God, as declared in Scripture, was that Jesus should be betrayed, seized, should suffer and die. Christ's will was one with the Father's and one with the Spirit's who inspired the Scripture, and therefore he must pass through each stage, undergo each detail, which the sacred volume specified. It was not merely that events were so arranged that they thus befell; nor merely that prophets of old foretold them; but there was some special moral duty and obligation in fulfilling them, which Christ, as one with the Father and the Holy Ghost, was minded to carry out in all perfection. Here was a ray of comfort for Peter and the other apostles. All was foreordained; its announcement in God's book proved it came from God, was under his control and ordering. Patience, therefore, and silent acquiescence were the duties now incumbent. "Be still, then, and know that I am God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-55.htm">Matthew 26:55</a></div><div class="verse">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?

He submitted to indignities, but he felt them deeply; he allowed himself to be treated as a malefactor, but was not insensible to the shame of being supposed to have been capable of acting as such. <span class="cmt_word">A thief</span>; <span class="accented">a robber.</span> One at the head of a band of lawless ruffians, who would resist you with arms in their hands - a <span class="accented">sicarius</span>, a cutthroat, who lurked in secret places to murder the innocent. <span class="cmt_word">I sat daily with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, probably an interpolation from Mark). All the past week, at any rate, Christ had taught quietly and openly in the temple. He had none of the habits of the robber; he had not courted secrecy; he had no company of armed men to defend him; why did they not arrest him then? According to St. Luke, Christ adds, "But this is your hour, and the power of darkness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a></div><div class="verse">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

He repeats to the multitude what he had said to Peter (ver. 54, where see note), and what he had already intimated at the last Supper (vers. 24, 31). To quote the words of Stier, "Again and again he de. clares that one thing which, nevertheless, Christian theology perpetually refuses to learn from the supreme Teacher and Doctor. He holds firmly to the Scripture, whether speaking to the exasperated Jews or the docile disciples; he puts those to shame in their folly by proofs from Scripture, and strengthens these in their despondency by its consolatory promises. He appeals to Scripture in his vehement disputation with men, as he does in his solemn way of suffering to die for them; he confronts Satan with 'It is written,' and prays to the Father - that the Scripture may be fulfilled." If Christ had been taken prematurely in the temple, and put to death by a tumultuary stoning, prophecy would not have been fulfilled, and his death would not have been the appointed sacrifice of the Lamb of God. <span class="cmt_word">Forsook him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and fled.</span> As he had foretold (ver. 31). They saw their Master bound and helpless; they recognized that he would not deliver himself by heavenly aid, and, fearing to share his fate, they looked to their own safety and basely abandoned him in his hour of danger. Now occurred the incident mentioned only by St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>), which is explained rightly by Edersheim (2:485, 544). Only Peter and John followed the officers to the high priest's palace.

His palace was nearest to the place of capture, and the soldiers appear to have received orders to conduct the Prisoner thither, Annas having vast influence with the Romans, and being the principal mover in the matter. What passed before him is not recorded, none of the disciples being present at the examination. The synoptists take up the account when Jesus was sent bound to Caiaphas, who St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-14.htm">John 18:14</a>) notes was the one who for political reasons had urged the judicial murder of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Where</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in whose house) <span class="cmt_word">the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> This seems to have been an informal meeting of the leading Sanhedrists, hastily convened, not in their usual place of meeting, but in a chamber of Caiaphas's palace. Some years before this time the right of pronouncing capital sentences had been removed from the council; and hence the necessity of assembling in the hall Gazith (where only such sentences could be delivered) existed no longer.

The words in brackets are probably spurious; they are omitted by the best uncials and the Vulgate.

The Sanhedrists had decided on Christ's death; it only remained to find such a charge against him as would compel the Roman authorities to deal summarily with him. For their purpose the truth of the accusation was immaterial, so long as it was established, according to Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), by two or three witnesses examined apart. They knew well that Christ could be condemned on no true testimony, hence they scrupled not to seek false. If they had meant to deal fairly, they would have allowed some who knew him to speak in his favour; but this was the very last thing which they desired or would have sanctioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a></div><div class="verse">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none.

What was offered was insufficient for the purpose, or inconsistent (<a href="../../par/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56</a>). The second "found none" is thought by many modern editors to be not genuine, and is accordingly expunged. It does not occur in the Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">At the last came two false witnesses.</span> When the case seemed hopeless and on the point of breaking down, some of the Sanhedrists' own creatures came forward with a distorted account of Christ's words spoken long before. They brought no accusation founded on any of his late utterances in the temple, or when he was charged with blasphemy and threatened with stoning (<a href="../../par/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>); they remembered keenly how he had discomfited them on such occasions, and they feared to elicit one of his crushing replies or unanswerable questions. They were glad to fall back upon something else, which especially concerned Annas and Caiaphas, and their gainful trading in the sacred courts (see the next note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a></div><div class="verse">And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This fellow</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).

Speaking metaphorically of his body, he had made this announcement, "Destroy ye this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>). At the time the Jews had not understood the words, and they now pervert them into a criminal accusation, which might take the form of charging him with being either an impious fomenter of disturbance, or a pretender to superhuman powers, Divine or Satanic. In either case, the charge would bring him into collision with the Roman authorities, which was the real object of this preliminary inquiry. We must not forget that Christ had twice interfered with the traffic in the temple, which was carried on to the great profit of the avaricious family of Annas, and that the malice of the high priests was on this account greatly embittered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62</a></div><div class="verse">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 62.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span> [Caiaphas] <span class="cmt_word">arose</span>.

He knew it was of no use, and was not the moment, to explain the mystery of the words which he had used. Indeed, it was unfair to ask him to explain the discrepancies in the alleged testimony. "Attempts at defence were unprofitable, no man hearing. For this was a show only of a court of justice, but in truth an onset of robbers, assailing him without cause, as in a cave or on the road" (St. Chysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The case was best met by a majestic silence. <span class="cmt_word">Answered</span>. Puzzled and embarrassed by Christ's persistent silence, Caiaphas at last proceeds to put to him a question which he must answer, and which must lead to some definite result. <span class="cmt_word">I adjure thee by the living God.</span> The high priest now addresses Jesus officially as the minister of Jehovah, and puts him under an oath to make an answer. To such an adjuration a reply was absolutely necessary, and the Law held a man guilty who kept silence under such circumstances (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Christ, the Son of God.</span> It is not to be supposed that Caiaphas by these words intended to imply that Messiah was one with God, of one nature, power, and eternity. It is not likely that he had risen above the popular Jewish conception of Messiah, which was of one inferior to God, though invested with certain Divine attributes. But he had heard that Jesus had more than once claimed God as his Father, so he now, as he hopes, will force a confession from the Prisoner's lips, which will set the question at rest one way or the other, and give him ground for decisive action, and enable him to denounce Christ either as an acknowledged impostor or a blasphemer. His language is, perhaps, based on the second psalm, vers. 2, 6, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 25); in St. Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>.

"This he did," says Chrysostom, "to add force to the accusation, and to increase the weight of his words by the act." His assessors, though fully agreeing with him, appear not to have followed his example in this particular, taking the high priest's action as typical and sufficiently expressive of the general sentiment. The Fathers see in it a symbol of the rending and destruction of the Jewish priesthood (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">spoken blasphemy</span>.

This detail, as they considered it, was now exclusively in the hands of the Romans. We see that this meeting, which virtually doomed Christ to death, was not a regular council of the Sanhedrin; for it was not held in the appointed chamber, and was conducted at night, when criminal processes were forbidden. The meeting next morning (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>) was convened for the purpose of considering how this informal sentence should be executed.

When the meeting broke up, Jesus was for a time left to the brutal cruelty and the unbridled insolence of the guards and servants.

The fact doubtless is this - that Peter did not distinctly three times, in three separate utterances, deny Christ, but that on three occasions, and under different circumstances, and in many different words, he committed this sin. There are, as it were, three groups of questions and replies, and the evangelists have recorded such portions of these details as seemed good to them, or such as they were best acquainted with. <span class="cmt_word">Peter sat</span> (<span class="accented">was sitting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>without in the palace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). We have seen (ver. 48) that Peter was introduced by John into the open court round which the palace was built, and on one side of which was the chamber in which the examination of Jesus was going on. He was within the palace enclosure, but outside the principal apartment; hence he is said in the text to have been without. Admission to the courtyard was gained by a passage through the side of a house, which formed the vestibule or porch; this was closed towards the street by a heavy gate, having in it a small wicket for the use of visitors, kept by a porter or other servant. <span class="cmt_word">A damsel.</span> This was the female porteress who kept the wicket by which Peter was admitted. She appears to have had some suspicion of him from the first, and to have followed him with her remarks from the gate, and to have continued them when he sat down with the servants at the fire kindled in the open court. <span class="cmt_word">Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> She says, "Thou also" in reference to John, whom she had first admitted, and who seems to have been in no danger, though Peter had great fears for his own safety. Though the porteress probably had no personal knowledge of the apostle, yet scanning his features by the light of the fire, noting his perturbed aspect and his restless actions, and reflecting on his companionship with John, she conjectured that he was a disciple of Christ, and more than once hazarded the assertion with the view of eliciting a definite answer.

The Galilaeans, we are told, could not properly pronounce the guttural letters, <span class="accented">aleph, kheth</span>, and <span class="accented">ayin</span>, and used <span class="accented">tau</span> for <span class="accented">shin, pe</span> for <span class="accented">beth</span>, etc.; they also often omitted syllables in words, occasioning equivocal mistakes, which afforded much amusement to the better instructed.

If the rulers had had special regard to legality, they could not have condemned Christ to death at night, as they had done at the late informal assembly; but their respect for conventional rules was overborne by passion and hatred. They had decreed his death by general consent, and then retired for a few hours' necessary rest. Now they again met together, still in the palace of Caiaphas (<a href="../../par/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>), in order to complete their evil work, to endorse the previous sentence, and, under some pretence, hand their Victim over to the Roman governor, who alone could execute their murderous purpose.

They were determined that he should die by an ignominious and cursed death, that his pretensions, as being  sent by God, might be disposed of forever. Hence arose the persistent cry, "Crucify him!" (vers. 22, 23). The Jewish view of crucifixion is seen in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. They possibly feared some outbreak if they delayed the execution, and kept him prisoner till the conclusion of the feast.

This was the treatment inflicted on condemned malefactors. During the actual official proceedings it was customary to release the accused person from bonds; hence this new binding was necessary. What passed in the council before this indignity was inflicted is, perhaps, told by St. Luke: the Sanhedrists satisfied themselves that they had a case against Jesus sufficient for their purpose, and they proceeded in a body to lay it before the governor. <span class="cmt_word">Pontius Pilate the governor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>). Some good manuscripts omit "Pontius," as in Mark and Luke; but there seems to be no doubt that he bore this <span class="accented">nomen gentilicium</span> (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44), which connected him with the Samnite <span class="accented">gens</span> of the Pontii. He was the sixth Roman Procurator of Judaea, and his title in Greek was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, which was a more general term for a commander or chief possessing more extensive powers. He held the office under the Prefect of Syria for ten years, at the end of which time he was removed for cruelty and extortion, and banished to Vienne, in Gaul, where he put an end to his own life. The turbulence and national animosity of the Jews had rendered it necessary to invest the procurator with the power of life and death, which he used in the most unscrupulous manner, so that he was universally hated and feared. The quarters of the Roman governor were called the Praetorium, and to this Christ was led. Pilate usually resided at Caesarea, but came to Jerusalem at the great festival, to be ready to quell any fanatical outbreak that might occur. So nowadays the Turks keep a body of troops in the same city to preserve the peace between Christian worshippers at Easter(!). Whether Pilate occupied the barracks at the fortress Antonia, or the magnificent palace of Herod, situated at the northwest angle of the upper city, is uncertain; but as we know that the Roman procurators did reside in Herod's palace, and as on this occasion Pilate was accompanied by his wife (ver. 19), it is most probable that he took up his abode in the latter, and that Jesus was brought before him there. Herod had a house of his own on the east of Zion, opposite the castle, which he seems to have occupied more often than his father's palace, thus leaving the latter at the pleasure of the Roman governors. Assuming this to be the case, Dr. Edersheim writes, "From the slope of the eastern angle, opposite the temple mount, where the palace of Caiaphas stood, up the narrow streets of the upper city, the melancholy procession wound to the portals of the grand palace of Herod. It is recorded that they who brought him would not themselves enter the portals of the palace, 'that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover'" ('Life and Times of Jesus,' 2:505). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-10.</span> - <span class="accented">Remorse and suicide of Judas, and the use made of the blood money.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18, 19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. This transaction took place either when Jesus was being conducted to the Praetorium, or during the interview with Herod (<a href="../../par/luke/23-7.htm">Luke 23:7-11</a>). A great number of the Sanhedrists had now withdrawn to the temple, and were sitting in conclave there. <span class="cmt_word">When he saw that he was condemned.</span> He evidently had not contemplated the full consequences of his crime; he never expected that the Jewish rulers would proceed to such extremities. It is probable that, in his lust for gain and his loss of love for his Master, he had. thought of nothing but his own sordid interests, and now was appalled at the share which he had had in bringing to pass this awful result. The excuse made in modern days for Judas, that he wished only to force our Lord to exert his Divine power, and to declare himself Messiah, is refuted by one out of many considerations (see on Matthew 26:14). His remorse at this moment has to be accounted for. If he still believed in Christ's Divine commission, he would not have despaired of a happy result even after his condemnation, nay, even when he was hanging on the cross. Christ's power to deliver himself and to assume his Messianic position remained unimpaired by these seemingly adverse circumstances, and a believer would have waited for the end before he surrendered all hope. Judas's character is not bettered by considering that he did evil that good might come, or that he was led to his base course by the hope that his worldly interests would be improved by the establishment of Messiah's temporal kingdom. That he had now any desire or ambition for a place in a spiritual kingdom cannot be conceived, for he had evidently lost all faith in Jesus, and followed him only for the most sordid motives. <span class="cmt_word">Repented himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>). This word (differing from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, which expresses change of heart) denotes only a change of feeling, a desire that what has been done could be undone; this is not repentance  in the Scripture sense; it springs not from love of God, it has not that character which calls for pardon. "Mark," says St. Chrysostom, "when it is that he feels remorse. When his sin was completed, and had received an accomplishment. For the devil is like this; he suffers not those who are careless to see the evil before this, lest he whom he has taken should repent. At least, when Jesus was saying so many things, he was not influenced, but when his offence was completed, then repentance came upon him, and not then profitably." Only now did he fully realize what he had done; in the light of his crime his conscience awoke and confounded him with vehement re-preaches: the object for which he had sinned seemed utterly unworthy and base; its attraction vanished when no longer pursued. <span class="cmt_word">Brought again</span> (<span class="accented">returned</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the thirty pieces of silver.</span> He had received the whole price for which he had bargained, but he could not retain the money now; it was a silent witness which he could not endure. He may have thought that he would throw away the guilt of his crime as he deprived himself of its wages, or that he could repair its consequences by this tardy restitution.

By speaking of "blood," he showed that he knew the murder was certain. Judas seems to have had no faith in Christ's Divinity, but he had perfect assurance of his holiness and innocence, and felt, and endeavoured to make the rulers feel, that an iniquitous sentence had been passed, and that a guiltless person was condemned to death. This consideration added to the bitterness of his regret. But he obtained no comfort from the hardened and unfeeling priests. They had gotten what they had desired. The question of Christ's moral guilt or innocence was nothing to them; equally indifferent to them was the fierce remorse of Judas. <span class="cmt_word">What is that to us?</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>See thou to that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">tu videris</span>, equivalent to "that is your concern," as in ver. 24). A more unfeeling, nay, fiendish answer could not have been given. It threw the wretched man back on himself, left him alone with his remorse, the blackness of his night unrelieved by any ray of human sympathy. In their own obduracy and impenitence they scorn the weakness of their miserable tool. As Bengel well moralizes, "Impii in facto consortes, post factum deserunt; pii, in facto non consortes, postea medentur." To sympathize with repentance is the duty and the privilege of the Christian; to deride and scoff at the returning sinner is devilish. It is profitable to contrast the sincere repentance of Peter after his fall with the remorse of the despairing Judas.

The priests were in the priests' court (which would be included in the term <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), separated by a stone partition from the court of the Gentiles. Into the latter area Judas had pressed; and, hurrying to the wall of division, he flung the cursed shekels with all his force into the inner place, as if to rescind the iniquitous contract and to cast away its pollution. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">departed.</span> He rushed away from the temple and the city into solitude, down into and across the valley of Hinnom, up the steep sides of the overhanging mountain - anywhere to escape human eyes, and, if it might be, to flee from himself.

He mounted some precipitous rock, and unwinding the girdle (for it was unnecessary to find and take a rope with him) which he wore, and in which he had doubtless carried the pieces of silver, fastened it round his neck, and securing it to some tree or projecting stone, flung himself from the height. The horrible result is told by St. Peter in his first address to the disciples (Acts 1:48), "Falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out." This may have resulted from the breaking of the girdle. A fragment of Papias gives another explanation, recounting that he was crushed and disembowelled by a passing waggon. Thus Judas, the only man concerning whom the terrible expression is used, went "to his own place" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>). he is the Ahithophel of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>: <a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12-14</a>).

It was inferred from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a> that no money unlawfully gained, or derived from an impure source, might be used in purchasing things for God's service. Under Jewish Law such money must be restored to the donor; if circumstances rendered this impossible, or the offerer insisted on giving it, it was to be expended for some public object, the original owner being considered, by a legal fiction, to be its possessor still, and that which was paid for by the money being deemed as his gift to the community (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>, "This man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity").

This deliberation may have taken place after the Crucifixion. <span class="cmt_word">The potter's field.</span> The spot was well known at the time. It is traditionally said to have lain on the south of Jerusalem - on the hillside across the valley of Hinnom, on what is called the Hill of Evil Counsel. Here is found a tract of clay, which is still used by the potters of the city. In the time of our Lord. the clay probably was considered to be exhausted, and the area, excavated in all directions, and useless for agricultural purposes, was sold for a trifling price. <span class="cmt_word">To bury strangers in</span>. The "strangers" are probably not pagans, but foreign Jews and Gentile proselytes, who came to Jerusalem to attend the festival, and died there. Others think that foreigners (Greeks and Romans, etc.) exclusively are meant, the Jews regarding their very presence in the holy city as defilement, and a cemetery purchased by unclean money a fitting spot for their interment. The "field" was set apart in the Crusaders' times as a burial place for pilgrims, and to this day contains a charnel house wherein are deposited the poor and unhonoured dead of Jerusalem.

It must be noted, however, that, though the passage in Zechariah has many remarkable affinities to the quotation in our evangelist's history, it is not. identical with it. In the prophet's vision there is no mention of the field, and the money is to be "cast to the potter in the house of the Lord." The Septuagint Version gives a very different reading, "Lay them in the foundry [or, 'furnace'], and I will see if it is approved, as I was approved for their sakes." And the last part of our quotation is hardly a representation of the Hebrew, "Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prised at of them." In the face of these discrepancies, it is supposed by many that St. Matthew had in his mind some utterance of Jeremiah not now extant; but if, as most expositors affirm, he was citing, more or less accurately, the words of Zechariah, we have to account for their being attributed to a wrong author. Of this difficulty, as it is considered, many solutions are offered. For instance: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The evangelist added no name to "the prophet;" and a scribe, hazily remembering the transaction in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6</a>, etc., interpolated the word "Jeremiah."

Plainly the evangelist has not confined himself to the actual words of his author or authors, but has written a Targum thereon,  being divinely guided to see in the present transaction a fulfilment of an obscure announcement and prefiguration in olden days There are many other solutions proposed, with which we need not concern ourselves; the one last stated is reasonable, and may be adopted safely by those simple Christians who believe that the writers of the Bible were supernaturally preserved from errors, not only in doctrine and precept and fact, but also in chronology, grammar, geography, citation, etc. The whole difficulty is of little importance, and too much has been made of what, alter all, may be simply an <span class="accented">erratum</span> perpetuated from an ancient copy. <span class="cmt_word">They took</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which might mean, "I took," as in Zechariah).

The Revised Version supplies <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "whom certain of the children of Israel did price." The words are ironical, answering to the prophet's expression, "the goodly price that I was prised at of them"! The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> may be rendered "on the part of;" so the evangelist means that the priests offered this mean price for the Shepherd at the instigation of, at the instance of, the children of Israel, who thus shared in and authorized the iniquitous transaction.

Pilate from the first had shown much reluctance to proceed, not being satisfied with the vague accusation that Jesus was a malefactor, and proposing that the Sanhedrists should try him according to Jewish Law, as if the question was merely a religious one. This treatment forced the priests to formulate a charge of which the roman authorities must take cognizance. They therefore stated unblushingly that Jesus had said that he was himself Christ a King (<a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). At this point St. Matthew's account steps in. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the King of the Jews?</span> This examination took place within the Praetorium, where Christ was detained in the custody of some guards. The accusation of the Jews had been made outside, as they had scruples about entering the building. Jesus had never actually (so far as recorded) called himself King, though the appellation had been applied to him by Nathanael (<a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), and the hosannahs of the multitudes had virtually so greeted him. His accusers had added the charge that he perverted the nation, and forbade to give tribute to Caesar. There is scorn and surprise, mingled with some awe, in Pilate's interrogation, "Thou - such a one as thou - art the King of the Jews?" <span class="cmt_word">Thou sayest.</span> What thou sayest is true. A strong affirmation. Christ accepts in its fullest sense that which the governor puts as a question (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25, 64</a>). St. Paul alludes to this scene in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>, "Christ Jesus, who before Pilate witnessed the good confession."

The mention of Galilee offered to Pilate a chance of escaping the responsibility of the trial, and led to his sending Christ to Herod, as St. Luke relates (<a href="../../par/luke/23-6.htm">Luke 23:6-12</a>). It was on the return from Herod that the final scene took place. Pilate evidently did not believe that this dignified, meek, inoffensive Man was guilty of sedition, and he desired to hear his defence, which he was willing to receive favourably (<a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>).

The custom is not elsewhere mentioned. It was, however, most probably an institution established of old time in memory of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a>), and continued by the Romans when they became masters of the country. A similar custom obtained at Rome and in Greece on certain great festivals. <span class="cmt_word">Whom they would.</span> The governor usually left the priests and people unfettered in their choice; on the present occasion he desired Jesus to be selected.

The Vulgate, with Origen, reads, "he had," <span class="accented">habebat</span>, referring to Pilate, whose prisoner he was. The man was notorious; as St. Mark tells us, "He lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, men who had committed murder in the insurrection." We have no account elsewhere of this particular rising, nor of its leader, but such commotions were very common, and under the guise of political aims were utilized for purposes of robbery and assassination. <span class="cmt_word">Called Barabbas.</span> The word means "Son of the father," which some explain "Son of a rabbi," which is improbable; and it is a question whether this was his real name, or one applied to him with reference to his pretensions to being "a political anti-Christ" - "a hideous caricature of the true Jesus, the Son of the eternal Father." It is a strange fact that in some (not very trustworthy) manuscripts the name is given as Jesus Barabbas, which affords a remarkable antithesis in Pilate's question in the following verse, "Wilt ye that I release Jesus Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?" There can be no reasonable doubt that the prefix is not genuine, but has crept into some texts inadvertently. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-17.htm">Matthew 27:17</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?

In Mark Pilate terms him, "the King of the Jews." He puts before them these two names as the limit of their choice, minor offenders being not worthy of consideration in the lace of these celebrated prisoners. And he names Christ's claims, as if he would remind the people that in Jesus they possibly had the Messiah whom they desired.

They had shown their envy of Christ's influence with the people; they were jealous of his reputation and success; grudged him his marvellous powers; were embittered by his attacks on rabbinism, and the undermining of their popularity. Pilate saw much of this; he penetrated behind their flimsy pretence of averting some possible danger from the Roman dominion, and he laboured in this indirect way to save the victim of this vindictive plot. Of course, Pilate could not fully appreciate Christ's character, nor enter into the question of his supernatural claims; he saw only that he was brought before him from the basest motives, that no real offence was proved against him, and that no fear could be entertained of his heading a popular tumult.

In the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus (ch. 2) she is said  to have been a convert to Judaism. Other accounts affirm that she ultimately became a Christian; and the Greek Church has canonized her, and inserted her in the Menology on October 27. It is probable that she was well acquainted with, and favourably disposed towards, the claims of Christ; and if she had impressed her husband in some degree with her own views, this fact may have influenced him to make some effort to save Jesus. Doubtless she had thought much upon the subject, and talked it over with Pilate; hence her dream was the natural sequence of that with which her mind had been filled in her waking moments, though providentially ordered. It speaks for the accuracy of the evangelist's account, that lately the governors had been allowed to take their wives with them into their official districts, a law previously having forbidden this indulgence (see Tacitus, 'Annul.,' 3:33, 34). <span class="cmt_word">Have thou nothing to do with that just Man.</span> Wordsworth well remarks, "In the whole history of the Passion of Christ no one pleads for him but a woman, the wife of a heathen governor, the deputy of the emperor of the world." This was another wanting given to Pilate to arrest him in his criminal cowardice. The expression used means literally, "Let there be nothing to thee and that Righteous One," which is equivalent to "Do nothing to him for which you will be hereafter sorry." <span class="cmt_word">I have suffered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">I suffered</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>many things this day in a dream because of him.</span> It is useless to inquire the nature of her dream. From the way in which it is here introduced, and from what we know of God's employment of dreams in other cases to communicate his will to men, we may reasonably conclude that this was divinely sent to convey a lesson to Pilate through his wife, who alone, perhaps, was able to arouse the better feelings of his heart. The mention of her suffering shows that she had some dreadful experiences to relate in connection with the fate of the righteous Jesus. As at the beginning of Christ's life, so at its close, such communications were addressed to strangers. Pilate's superstitious fears would be excited by this mysterious dream, but they were not able to overpower counteracting influences.

He is a political offender; he is a mover of sedition against the Roman supremacy; let him meet the punishment to which Rome dooms her lowest criminals and runagates.

The present tense gives a graphic touch to the narrative. The delay and hesitation of the governor exasperated the people, and there were ominous signs of a riot, which must be suppressed at any sacrifice of principle or equity. He feared that a report might reach Rome of his having occasioned dangerous excitement at the Passover by refusing to punish a pretender to the Jewish throne, he submits to the popular will, but endeavours to save himself from the guilt of an accomplice in a most atrocious murder. <span class="cmt_word">Took water,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and washed his hands before the multitude.</span> This symbolical action would appeal to the Jewish sentiment, as it was a mode of asserting innocence prescribed in the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>). Pilate thus publicly, in the sight of all the multitude who might not have been able to hear his words, attested his opinion of the innocence of Christ, and weakly cast the guilt upon the people, as if the administration of justice lay with them and not with him. Such lustrations were not exclusively Jewish, but were practised both among Greeks and Romans in expiation of guilt (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and Kuinoel, <span class="accented">ad</span> cap. 3:6). <span class="cmt_word">I am innocent of the blood of this just Person.</span> Some manuscripts, followed by Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort, omit "just Person (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." If the word is genuine, it must be regarded as an echo of the wife's message to Pilate (ver. 19). The cowardly governor thus shakes off the responsibility of the perversion of justice which he allows. <span class="cmt_word">See ye to it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vos videritis</span>, as ver. 4). You will take all the responsibility of the act; the blame will not be mine. Vain hope! Pilate may wash his hands, he cannot purify heart or conscience from the stain of this foul murder. As long as the Church lasts so long will the Creed announce that Jesus "suffered under Pontius Pilate."

A mad and impious imprecation. the fulfilment of which quickly commenced, and has continued unto this day. The terrible events connected with the destruction of Jerusalem, the overthrow of the theocracy, and the eighteen centuries of exile and dispersion, bear witness to the reality of the vengeance thus wantonly invoked. "As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them" (<a href="../../par/psalms/140-9.htm">Psalm 140:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a></div><div class="verse">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>him</i> to be crucified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Released he Barabbas</span> - "him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired" (Luke). <span class="cmt_word">When he had scourged Jesus.</span> This was the usual preliminary to crucifixion, especially in the case of shires, and was a punishment of a most severe and cruel nature. The verb here used, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, is formed from the Latin <span class="accented">flagellum</span>, and denotes the employment of that terrible implement the Roman scourge. This was no ordinary whip, but commonly a number of leather thongs loaded with lead or armed with sharp bones and spikes, so that every blow cut deeply into the flesh, causing intense pain. The culprit was stripped of his clothes, pinioned, and bound to a stake or pillar, and thus on his bare back suffered this inhuman chastisement. To think that the blessed Son of God was subject to such torture and indignity is indeed a lesson for us written in blood. When "he gave his back to the smiters" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>), he was taking the punishment of our sin upon his sacred shoulders. "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). Possibly Pilate thought that the sight of Christ's suffering might arouse at this last moment the pity of the Jews (<a href="../../par/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1-16</a>). But he was mistaken. The appetite of the bloodthirsty crowd was only whetted by this anticipatory taste; they insisted on the whole programme being canted out, and Pilate yielded to the demand, giving up the useless struggle. <span class="cmt_word">He delivered him to be crucified.</span> Pilate delivered Jesus to the will of the people, directing the soldiers to carry out the ordered execution. On the view taken by the Romans themselves of crucifixion, commentators quote Cicero, 'In Verr.,' 2:5. 66, "It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is an act of wickedness; to put him to death is almost parricide: what shall I say of crucifying him? An act so  abominable it is impossible to find any word adequately to express."

This is probably what is meant here, as they would not denude the barracks of all its occupants, who consisted of one cohort of about six hundred men (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:15. 6). The soldiers summoned their comrades on guard at the palace or in the Tower of Antonia to come and join in the cruel sport. "The devil was then entering in fury into the hearts of all.

Lange describes the procession: "Instead of being led forth by litters, the command of whom Pilate, as sub-governor, did not enjoy, Jesus is conducted to the cross by the soldiery. A centurion on horseback, called by Tacitus 'Exactor mortis,' by Seneca 'Centurio supplicio praepositus,' headed the company. A herald, going in front of the condemned, proclaimed his sentence."

Cyrene was a district in the north of Africa, under Roman rule, and colonized by a large number of Jews (Josephus, 'Cont. Apion.,' 2:4; 'Ant.,' 14:07. 2), who had a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>). Simon doubtless became a follower of Christ, and St. Mark mentions his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, as well known believers (see <a href="../../par/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>).

The cross was probably the ordinary Latin cross, <span class="accented">crux immissa</span>, of which, however, the lower limb below the transom was longer than the upper; and this latter afforded a place where could be affixed the board containing the inscription. It was not as tall as usually represented; we are told that beasts of prey were able to gnaw the bodies hung thereon. In fact, the culprit's feet were only just raised above the ground, being drawn up till the soles lay flat on the upright beam. Nails were driven through the hands and feet, and the body was supported partly by these, and partly by a projecting pin of wood called the seat. The rest for the feet, often seen in pictures, was never used. A slight covering was allowed for decency's sake, the rest of the body being stripped of clothing; and thus the condemned, exposed to scorching sun, bleeding from the cruel scourge, suffering untold agonies, was left to die. Whether Jesus carried the whole cross or only the transom is uncertain. It is possible that the two were tied together by a rope at one end, so as to form an inverted V, and fastened in the proper position at the place of execution. However this may he, it proved too heavy a burden for him to bear. Spent with his long vigil and lack of food, his spirit afflicted by the agony in the garden and the unknown sufferings then and afterwards, his body tortured with open wounds and weakened with loss of blood, he sank beneath the weight, as he staggered weariedly along the rough and hilly streets, Either from a momentary compunction, or more probably flora impatience at the slowness of the poor Sufferer's movements, the soldiers gladly seized on Simon to relieve the Prisoner of the cross, or to share its weight, and thus enable them sooner to complete their cruel task.

Tradition (authorized by Origen) pointed to it as the spot where Adam was buried, and where his skull was found - a story that seems to have arisen from the typical reason that it was congruous that the first Adam and the second Adam should meet in death, the latter winning the victory there where the former showed his defeat. Most probably the name was given to it as descriptive of its appearance, a bare space of rock (not a hill) denuded of verdure, and bearing a distant resemblance to a human skull wanting hair. The actual situation of Calvary is hotly contested by exegetes and travellers, and is still far from being determined. The only criterion offered by our accounts in the Gospels is that it was without the then walls of the city, not far from one or the gates, and by the side of one of the principal roads leading from the city to the country. A certain knoll on the hill Gareb towards the northwest, by which the Damascus road led, and to which Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:39) refers, is supposed, not very happily, to answer these requirements, If the present Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the northwest of Jerusalem, really contains the actual Golgotha and the tomb of our Lord, the course of the second wall as usually drawn cannot be correct, as it embraces this site completely (see the <span class="accented">Guardian</span>, August 30, 1893, p. 1353). Opinion, always altering, has lately been inclined to endorse the  authenticity of many of the traditional sites in the holy city and its neighbourhood. Further discoveries will set this and other matters at rest. Meantime, judgment must be suspended (see on ver. 51).

Doubtless the two words represent the same fluid, a wine of a sharp and acrid taste. The received reading in our text is supposed to be derived from <a href="../../par/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me gall for my meats, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." "Gall" here signifies some bitter ingredient (St. Mark calls it "myrrh"), which was infused in the wine to impart a narcotic quality. It was the custom to offer this draught to criminals about to undergo crucifixion, either as an anodyne or to give them adventitious strength to bear their sufferings. The beverage is said to have been prepared by some benevolent ladies in Jerusalem, and to have been owed to a gloss on <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul; let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a></div><div class="verse">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They crucified him.</span> We should try to realize the utter degradation as well as the anguish of such a death. No modern form of punishment carries with it the abhorred ignominy with which crucifixion was regarded, and we must put ourselves back eighteen centuries, and enter into the feelings of Jews and Romans, if we would view it in its genuine aspect. The narrative of this harrowing scene could not be simpler. The writer leaves it reverently to speak for itself, without any attempt at sensational adjuncts or rhetorical amplification. There is no indignation at the outrage, no compassion for the Sufferer, no commendation of the Divine patience. These are suppressed, because they needed no words; the unvarnished details are more than sufficient to place the reader by the Saviour's side, and make him feel every pang, sympathize with the grief, the shame, the horror, that rent the heart of Jesus. The sacred authors have said little about the mode of crucifixion, and have left untold many particulars which we should have liked to hear. This horrid punishment was too well known at that time to need description, and they saw no necessity for dwelling on its revolting details. (For some of these, see on ver. 32.) Whether in the present case the upright beam of the cross was fixed in its position before the Prisoner was fastened to it, or whether it was laid flat on the ground, set in order, and the Sufferer was nailed thereto before it was raised and settled in its place, we are not informed. The former was the method commonly employed. To carry out the execution a quaternion of soldiers (<a href="../../par/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>) was appointed under the command of a centurion (ver. 54) <span class="cmt_word">Parted his garments, casting lots.</span> The clothes of criminals were the perquisite of the soldiers charged with the execution. They divided these amongst the four, casting lots to determine what each should take. Further details are supplied by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That it might be fulfilled...they cast lots</span>. These words are retained in the Clementine Vulgate and a few cursives, but omitted by the best uncials and most other manuscripts. Modern editors almost universally have rejected them as an interpolation from the parallel passage in St. John. There can be no doubt, however, that, whether genuine or not in this place, they represent the truth. The soldiers' act did fulfil in marvellous fashion the psalmist's enunciation (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>), where the stripping of the Lord's Anointed and the disposal of his raiment are prophetically stated.

Crucifixion was not accompanied by immediate death. It was one of its greatest horrors that the tortured sufferer sometimes lived for days before death relieved him from his agony. Till this supervened, the guard had to keep watch. That this caution was not superfluous, we have intimations in ancient history, which tells of crucified persons being sometimes removed by their friends and restored to the use of their limbs and faculties. Josephus ('Vita,' 75) relates that he thus took down three criminals after a lengthened suspension, one of whom completely recovered, though the others succumbed to their injuries. This vigilance  of the soldiers was providentially ordered as one of the means of proving the reality of Christ's death.

It was written in three languages, so that all of whatever nationality might read it - in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek (for the order, see Westcott on <a href="../../par/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the national Aramaic, familiar to all Jews; the official Latin,understood by the soldiers and Romans; the current Greek, the dialect of Hellenistic Jews, and largely used by all classes. "These three languages gathered up the results of the religious, the social, the intellectual preparation for Christ, and in each witness was given to his office" (Westcott). The title is given by the four evangelists with some verbal variations, which are owing in part to the actual differences existing in the three versions of the inscription. They run thus: "'This is Jesus the King of the Jews" (Matthew); "The King of the Jews" (Mark); "This is the King of the Jews" (Luke); "Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews" (John). Of these titles, those given by Mark and Luke probably represent the Latin; that of Matthew, the Greek; while that of John was intended for the national population, who alone would understand the veiled sneer contained in the addition, "of Nazareth." The legend of the finding of the cross and its inscription is given by Butler, 'Lives of the Saints,' on 'The Invention of the Holy Cross.' A supposed fragment of the title is preserved at Rome, in the Church of the Holy Cross, and declared by a papal bull to be authentic. In this case infallibility has rather overstepped its limits.

Thus was Christ "numbered with the transgressors" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). St. Luke alone relates the acceptance of the penitent thief. If he was the one set on the right hand, possibly the careful mention of the position of the two robbers, which is found in the ether evangelists, may have a silent reference to this episode. We know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 16:10, 8; 20:8, 10; 'Belt. Jud.,' 2:12, 2, etc.) that Palestine was infested with banditti, who were rigorously pursued by the Romans, and were commonly crucified when captured. Doubtless these two criminals had been taken red-handed in some act of robbery and murder, and it was an exquisite malice that treated Jesus as their comrade and accomplice, and placed him in the position of their leader. But Augustine sees a spiritual signification in this scene: "The very cross was the tribunal of Christ; for the Judge was placed in the middle; one thief, who believed, was set free; the other, who reviled, was condemned; which signified what he was already about to do with the quick and dead; being about to set some on his right hand, but ethers on his left."

Many of them knew nothing of Christ's case, but seeing him punished in company with the two malefactors, thought that he was doubtless guilty of the same crimes as they; others, perhaps, who had seen his miracles and heard something of his teaching, conceived the notion that one whom the priests and rulers condemned must be a dangerous impostor, and deserved the cruelest of deaths. <span class="cmt_word">Reviled him;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">railed on him</span>; <span class="accented">blasphemabant</span> (Vulgate).

Some manuscripts and versions read the passage thus: "Save thyself, if thou be the Son of God, and come down from the cross." But the Received Text is most probably correct. These revilers are doing the devil's work, and are quoting his words (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>), in thus taunting Jesus. They refer to our Lord's own statement before Pilate (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>), thinking it expedient to keep this claim before the people's mind. He might, indeed, have answered the jibe by coming down from the cross; but then, as Bishop Pearson says, in saving himself he would not have saved us.

The historical accuracy of this darkness there is no more reason to doubt than there is to doubt the death of Christ itself: The great fact and its details stand on the same basis. How the phenomenon was produced we know not. That it could not be an ordinary eclipse is certain, as the moon was then full, it being the Paschal time, and the darkness thus produced would have lasted but a few minutes. Nor had it any connection with the subsequent earthquake (ver. 51), as some unscientific exegetes have supposed. On such occasions a thickness of the atmosphere has been noticed, but such an occurrence could never have been described in the words used by the synoptists; and. the earthquake itself was no ordinary event, and took place in no ordinary manner. We cannot doubt that the darkness was supernatural, conveying a solemn lesson to all who beheld it. When we consider what was being done on Calvary, who it was that was dying there, what was the object of his Passion, what was the infinite and unspeakable effect of the sacrifice there offered, is it wonderful that the Divine Architect controlled Nature to sympathize with her Creator, that as a supernatural effulgence heralded the Saviour's birth, a supernatural darkness should shroud his death? We are in the region of the Divine. What we have learned to regard as natural laws (but which really are only our formulary for expressing our experience of past uniformity) were superseded for the time by the interference of the Lawgiver; he used the material to enforce the spiritual being the Lord of both. Whether the darkness extended beyond Judaea unto all that part of the earth which was then illumined by the light of the sun, we cannot tell. Some of the Fathers refer to it as if it was universal. A supposed allusion was made by Phlegon, a writer of the second century, whose work, called 'Annals of the Olympiads,' is not extant, but is quoted by Julius Africanus and Eusebius (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); but it seems certain that Phlegon is speaking of an astronomical eclipse which occurred in the ordinary course of nature. Tertullian states that a notice of this darkness was to be found in the archives of Rome ('Apol.,' 21.); but we have no further information on this point. There are some other uncertain references, as that of Dionysius the Areopagite, who is related to have said on the sudden obscuration, "Either the God of nature is suffering, or the machinery of the world is being dissolved;" but none of these will stand the test of criticism; and perhaps it is safer to determine that Gentile notices of the phenomenon are not forthcoming, because the darkness was confined to Palestine. It had, doubtless, a doctrinal and typical significance. Chrysostom considers it a token of God's anger at the crime of the Jews in crucifying Jesus; others see in it an emblem of the withdrawal of the light of God's presence from this wicked land.

The other evangelists do not mention it at all. The language is Aramaic, doubtless that used commonly by our Lord. He quotes the words of the twenty-second psalm as applicable to himself, as offering a foreordained expression of his agony of soul. Into the full meaning of this bitter cry we cannot venture irreverently to intrude. At the same time, thus much may be said. It was not mere bodily anguish  that elicited it; it arose from some incalculable affliction of soul. He was bearing the sins of the whole world; the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all; there was no one to comfort him in his heaviness; and the light of God's countenance was for the time withdrawn from him. He was "left" that he might bear man's sins in their full and crushing weight, and by bearing save. Yet there is no despair in this lamentable outcry. He who could thus call upon God has God with him, even in his utter loneliness. "Amid the faintness, or the confusion of mind, felt at the approach of death, he experiences his abandonment by God; and yet his soul rests firmly on, and his wilt is fully subject to, God, while he is thus tasting death forevery man through God's grace .... He held firmly to God and retained the Divinity of his life, at the time when in his unity with mankind, and in his human feeling, the feeling of abandonment by God amazed him" (Lange). The verb "forsaken" is not in the perfect tense, as translated in the Authorized Version, but in the aorist; and it implies that during the three hours of darkness Christ had been in silence enduring this utter desolation, which had now come to its climax. The Man Christ Jesus asked <span class="accented">why</span> he was thus deserted; his human heart would fain comprehend this phase of the propitiatory sufferings which he was undergoing. No answer came from the darkened heaven; but the cry was heard; the unspeakable sacrifice, a sacrifice necessary according to the Almighty's purpose, was accepted, and with his own blood he obtained eternal redemption for man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-47.htm">Matthew 27:47</a></div><div class="verse">Some of them that stood there, when they heard <i>that</i>, said, This <i>man</i> calleth for Elias.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some of them that stood there.</span> These could not have been the Roman soldiers, for they would not have understood the Saviour's language, and could have known nothing about Elias.

In the first case, we must suppose that they spoke in cruel mockery - the last of the brutal insults vented on the meek Sufferer. He cannot save himself; he appeals to the old prophet to come to rescue him; was there ever such presumption? There are two considerations which militate against this supposition. The time of ribaldry and abuse is now past; the supernatural darkness has had a calming and terrifying effect; and there is no spirit of mockery left in the awed bystanders. Besides this, it is not likely that Jews, who with all their errors and vices paid an outward respect to holy things, would have presumed to make a play on the sacred name of God. Therefore it is no more reasonable to hold that, misunderstanding Christ's words, they spoke seriously, with some vague, superstitious idea that Elijah might appear at this crisis, and rescue the Sufferer (see ver. 49).

In St. Mark the verb is in the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, that is, the giver of the drink calls upon the others to keep quiet and wait. <span class="cmt_word">Let as see whether Elias will come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">cometh</span>, is coming). They speak in a kind of superstitious mockery, half deriding and half believing in the possible appearance of the great prophet. Between this verse and the following, the Sinaitic, Vatican, and some other manuscripts, together with some few versions, insert a passage borrowed from <a href="../../par/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, "And another taking a spear pierced his side, and there came out water and blood." This evident interpolation has been introduced by a scribe, who deemed it expedient to rectify an omission on St. Matthew's part, and clumsily inserted it in a wrong place. It is to be rejected, not only on critical, but on historical and theological grounds, seeing that it makes the piercing of the side to precede Christ's death, and conveys the impression that it was this spear wound that cut short his life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-50.htm">Matthew 27:50</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had cried again.</span> He had cried aloud once before (ver. 46). But he does not repeat the former words; the horror of great darkness was past. Probably the cry here resolved itself into the words recorded by St. Luke, "Father, into  thy hands I commend my spirit." <span class="cmt_word">With a loud voice.</span> This loud cry at the moment of death proved that he laid down his life voluntarily; no man could take it from him (<a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); he himself willed to die; and this preternatural voice proceeded from one who died not altogether from physical exhaustion, but from determined purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Yielded up the ghost</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)fh  =  ke to\ pneu  =  ma</span>); literally, <span class="accented">dismissed his spirit</span>; <span class="accented">emisit spiritum</span>). The phrase has been interpreted to signify that Christ exerted his power to anticipate the actual moment of dissolution; but there is no necessity of importing this idea into the expression. It is used ordinarily to denote the act of dying, as we say, "He expired." Perhaps the exertion of uttering this great cry ruptured some organ of the body. We know from the effect of the piercing of his side that his sacred heart was previously broken; and thus he verily and really died upon the cross. He, being in the form of God, and equal with God, became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, suffered death forevery man. It is to be noted that the death of Christ occurred at 3 p.m., the very time when the Paschal lambs began to be slain in the temple courts. Thus the long prepared type was at last fulfilled, when "Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51-56.</span> - <span class="accented">Signs following the death of Christ.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/15-38.htm">Mark 15:38-41</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47-49</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> St. Matthew thus introduces his account of the portents which attended the death of the Son of God. The rending of the veil is mentioned by the synoptists as consequent on, and occurring simultaneously with, the completion of the ineffable sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">The veil of the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). There were two principal veils in the present temple - one between the vestibule and the holy place, and one other which is that here referred to, a constituent part of the edifce. This was the veil between the holy place and the holy of holies, which was moved aside only once a year to admit the high priest to the shrine on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>). It was large and costly, some sixty feet high, and made of rich materials. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 4) tells us of one of the veils in the temple, that it was a Babylonian curtain, embroidered with linen in various colours, woven together with wonderful art, such as the eye loved to rest upon. <span class="cmt_word">Was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span> An apocryphal Gospel ('The Gospel of the Hebrews'), quoted by St. Jerome, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, asserts that the exquisitely carved lintel to which the veil was fastened was at this moment shattered to pieces, and in its fall tore the curtain asunder. The direction of the rent would show that no human hands had torn it apart, and the rending seems to have preceded the earthquake. The violent act was supernatural, and of a typical nature, as we are taught by <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6-12</a>. The sanctuary enshrined the presence of God, from which the veil excluded every one but the high priest on one special occasion, thus denoting the imperfect reconciliation between God and his people, and that the way to the holiest was not yet made manifest. The rending of this veil betokened the opening of the access to heaven through the wounded body of Christ: as we read in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a>, "Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh." "When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers." The distinction between Jew and Gentile was abolished, the mysteries of the old Law were opened and manifested, all rites and ceremonies were made of sacramental efficacy, and ministered grace. How soon this ominous occurrence was discovered, we know not. The priest who offered incense at the evening sacrifice about this same hour must have seen it, and spread abroad among his comrades the news, to which many would attach a meaning fatal to the security of their religion. But this was comparatively a private sign; the next one was of a more comprehensive and public character. <span class="cmt_word">The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</span> The last verb is the same as was used just before in the case of the veil. There was a local earthquake at this awful moment, as if the very land shuddered at the terrible crime that had been committed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem is supposed to cover the Golgotha of the Crucifixion (see on ver. 33). "An opening, faced with silver, shows the spot where the cross is said to have been sunk in the rock, and less than five feet from it is a long brass open work slide, over a cleft in the rock, which is about six inches deep, but is supposed by the pilgrims to reach to the centre of the earth. This is said to mark the rending of the rocks at the Crucifixion" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' p. 447). The fact of the earthquake is testified by Phlegon, whose words were quoted by Julius Africanus, in his 'Chronographia' (fragments of which work have been published by Routh and others), and by Eusebius, in his 'Chronicon' (the passage, no longer extant in the original, being preserved by Jerome, and in an Armenian version; see Morison, on ver. 45). The rending of the rocks is attested by St. Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem ('Cateches.,' 13:33), who speaks  of the remarkable fissure in Golgotha, which he had often noticed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-52.htm">Matthew 27:52</a></div><div class="verse">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The graves</span> (<span class="accented">the sepulchres</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>were opened.</span> The earthquake tore away the stones that closed the mouths of many of the adjacent tombs.

Who are meant by "the saints" here is doubtful. The Jews probably would have understood the term to apply to the worthies of the Old Testament (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>). But the opening of the sepulchres in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem would not have liberated the bodies of many of those who were buried far away. The persons signified must be those who in life had looked for the hope of Israel, and had seen in Christ that hope fulfilled; they were such as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, true believers, who are called saints in the New Testament. How did these bodies arise? or how were they raised up? They were not mere phantoms, unsubstantial visitants from the spirit world, for they were in some sense corporeal. That they were not resuscitated corpses, as Lazarus, Jairus's daughter and the son of the widow, who lived for a time a second life, seems plain from the expression applied to them in the next verse, that "they appeared unto many," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to persons who had known them while living. Some have thought that in them was anticipated the general resurrection, that, delivered from Hades and united to their bodies, they died no more, but at the Ascension accompanied Christ into heaven. Scripture says nothing of all this, nor have we any reason to suppose that any human body, save that of our blessed Lord (mediaeval legends add that of the Virgin Mary), has yet entered the highest heaven (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39, 40</a>). Another opinion is that these were not strictly resurrections, but bodily appearances of saints like those of Moses and Elias at the Transfiguration; but it is a straining of language to make the evangelist describe such visitations as bodies arising from open sepulchres. Farrar tries to elude the difficulty by a supposition, as baseless as it is dishonouring to the evangelist's strict and simple veracity. He writes, "An earthquake shook the earth and split the rocks, and as it rolled away from their places the great stones which closed and covered the cavern sepulchres of the Jews, so it seemed to the imaginations of many to have disimprisoned the spirits of the dead, and to have filled the air with ghostly visitants, who, after Christ had risen, appeared to linger in the holy city. Only in some such way," he adds, "can I account for the singular and wholly isolated allusion of Matthew." Because a fact is mentioned by one evangelist only, it is not on this account incredible. St. Matthew was probably an eyewitness of that which he relates, and might have been confuted by his contemporaries, if he had stated what was not true. An early witness to the fact is found in Igmatius, who, in his 'Epistle to the Magnesians,' ch. 9, speaks of Christ when on earth raising the prophets from the dead. The whole matter is mysterious and beyond human ken; but we may well believe that at this great crisis the Lord, who is the Resurrection and the Life, willed to exemplify his victory over death. and to make manifest the resurrection of the body, and this he did by releasing some saintly souls from Hades, and clothing them with the forms in which they had formerly lived, and permitting them to show themselves thus to those who knew and loved them. Of the future life of these resuscitated saints we know nothing, and will not presumptuously venture to inquire. When they have demonstrated that the sting was now taken from death, that the power of the grave was broken, that men shall rise again with their bodies and be known and recognized, they pass out of sight into the unseen world, and we can follow them no further. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a></div><div class="verse">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came out of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the graves</span> <span class="cmt_word">after his resurrection</span>. The masculine participle, not agreeing with "bodies" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), denotes the personality of the bodies of the saints, that these arose perfect in soul and body. They could not rise before Christ rose. "Christ the firstfruits, afterwards they that are Christ's." Ewald and others have understood "after his resurrection" to mean "after he raised them from the dead." But the language is against such an interpretation, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the words refer to Christ's own resurrection. If it be contended that the word used, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, is active in sense, we may reply that, granting this, it merely emphasizes Christ's voluntary action in raising himself. As was said above, St. Matthew anticipates the regular sequence of events in order to complete at one view his accounts of the portents that attended the death and resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The holy city</span>. Jerusalem, as in ch. 4:5. The guilty Jerusalem is still the holy city, as retaining the temple, with its services, the ministry, the Scriptures. Some would understand the heavenly Jerusalem,  into which these spiritual bodies entered; but the context is wholly against such an exposition. <span class="cmt_word">Appeared unto many.</span> They were permitted to show themselves openly in their well known forms to pious relations and friends, as witnesses and proofs of the resurrection. If they had already gone to heaven, they could not have thus appeared. It may he right to add that many of the Fathers and modern commentators hold that these resuscitated saints were those to whom Christ preached (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>) when he descended into hell, and that they accompanied him into glory when he ascended into heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a></div><div class="verse">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The centurion, and they that were with him.</span> The officer with the small body of soldiers appointed to perform and take charge of the Crucifixion.

But there is no sufficient reason for altering the Received Text; and plainly it was not merely the closing incident that affected the soldiers, but the whole course of events which they witnessed. They saw the darkness, the earthquake, the rending of the rocks, the Divine meekness of the Sufferer; they heard his last words, his loud cry, and marked his patient death. All these things contributed to their awe and fear. <span class="cmt_word">They feared greatly</span>. This crucified Man must be something more than human, for all these wonders to accompany his death: will he not visit upon us our part in his crucifixion? Have we nothing to fear from his vengeance? Some such course their apprehensions may have taken. But they learned something beyond selfish dread of possible danger. <span class="cmt_word">Truly this was the Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, anarthrous, Son) <span class="cmt_word">of God;</span> or, according to St. Luke, "Certainly this was a righteous Man." They recognized his innocence, and acknowledged that he suffered unjustly. What the centurion meant (for the words appear to have been his) by calling him "Son of God" is more doubtful. It may have been on his lips merely an affirmation that Jesus was holy and beloved by God; but more probably it meant much more than this. He knew that Christ claimed to be the Son of God, and in this hour of overwhelming awe he felt that the claim was just, whatever it might mean. This crucified Person was at least a hero or a demigod, or that which the words would imply in a Jewish sense, though he knew only imperfectly what was signified thereby. Tradition affirms that the centurion's name was Longinus, that he became a devoted follower of Christ, preached the faith, and died a martyr's death.

She was a native of Magdala (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-39.htm">Matthew 15:39</a>, where see note), a small village on the shore of Gennesaret. Some have identified her with the sister of Lazarus, chiefly because, taking her to be the "sinner" mentioned in <a href="../../par/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, she is related to have behaved in a somewhat similar way to our Lord as her namesake. But this is clearly a mistake. Of the two events, the locality, the scene, the occasion, the circumstances, are different. Of this Mary of Magdala we really know nothing, except that out of her Jesus had cast seven devils (<a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>). That these were demons of impurity, or that she was the sinful woman who anointed our Lord, there is nothing whatever to prove; though the notion connected with the name Magdalene is so rooted in men's minds and language that it is impossible to eradicate it, however erroneous it may be shown to be. She had probably been one who was melancholy mad, and subject to fits; Christ had seen the spiritual cause of this malady, and removed it by freeing her from demoniacal possession. What wonder is it that she followed him from Galilee, tending him lovingly and anxiously until the end? <span class="cmt_word">Mary the mother of James and Joses.</span> Some manuscripts read <span class="accented">Joseph</span>; but the Received Text is correct. These two persons are mentioned among our Lord's "brethren" in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>. The former is called "James the Less" (<a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>), and is the apostle of that name. Mary is usually supposed to be the wife of Cleophas (<a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>), and the sister of the mother of our Lord; so that these two disciples would be Christ's first cousins. The matter is shrouded in difficulty, and cannot be decided with  absolute certainty. From the present passage, at any rate, one fact is shown, that they were not Christ's uterine brothers - a truth which needed no mention, were not the dishonouring heresy of Helvidius still rife among us. <span class="cmt_word">The mother of Zebedee's children.</span> Salome (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a></div><div class="verse">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57-61.</span> - <span class="accented">The burial of the body of Jesus.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42-47</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50-56</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-42</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the even was come.</span> This was what was called the first evening, the time between the ninth hour, or three o'clock, and sunset, and the great sabbath would shortly be beginning. It was the Roman custom to leave criminals hanging on the cross for days, till their bodies were devoured by birds and wild animals; the Jewish Law enacted that when bodies were penally suspended, they should be taken down and buried before night (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>), that the land might not be defiled. Tomorrow (beginning at sunset), being a specially solemn day, as combining the sabbath and the Passover celebration, the Jews were particularly anxious that the crucified bodies of our Lord and the two robbers should be taken away and put out of sight before the sabbath began. To effect this object, they went to Pilate, and begged him to put an end to their sufferings by the sharp, short process of breaking their legs. St. John's account must be referred to for this and the result of the soldiers' examination of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">There came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.</span> He is further said to have been "an honourable counsellor," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a member of the Sanhedrin, "a good man and a just, who also waited for the kingdom of God, and had not consented to the counsel and deed" of the rest of the rulers. "It was divinely appointed," says the Ven. Bede, "that Joseph should be rich, in order to have access to Pilate, for no mean man could have access to the governor; and that he should be a just man, in order to receive the body of our Lord." This man's native place was Arimathaea, a town with much probability identified with Ramathaim-Zophim of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, which lay in Mount Ephraim, and was the birthplace of the Prophet Samuel. That he was "a rich man" naturally gave him some influence with Pilate, and joined with his position as a Sanhedrist, made his request more likely to be granted. "One Joseph was appointed by God to be guardian of Christ's body in the virgin womb, and another Joseph was the guardian of his body in the virgin tomb, and each Joseph is called a 'just man' in Holy Scripture" (Wordsworth). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-58.htm">Matthew 27:58</a></div><div class="verse">He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went to Pilate.</span> St. Mark says, "came and went in boldly unto Pilate." He had hitherto been a disciple of Christ, "secretly for fear of the Jews" (<a href="../../par/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>); now that Christ was dead, and his death accompanied with such manifest wonders, according absolutely with ancient prophecy, and fulfilling Christ's own predictions, he hesitated no longer, he openly professed his partisanship, and threw in his lot with the Crucified. If from expediency or pusillanimity he had refrained from taking a prominent position as a favourer of this wonderful Teacher, he had lately learned a new lesson, and hailed the opportunity of publicly honouring him deceased whom in his heart he had loved and reverenced while alive. So he went to the Praetorium to see the procurator, whose sanction was required for removing the body of a criminal from the cross. It was probably after the deputation of the Jews to Pilate, mentioned by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31</a>), that Joseph had his interview. <span class="cmt_word">Begged the body of Jesus.</span> It was not unusual for friends to obtain leave to pay the last rites and to give decent sepulture in such cases; otherwise the corpses were thrown carelessly into nameless graves, if they were not left to rot on the cross. The indignities which Christ had suffered during life now began to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Commanded the body to be delivered.</span> Pilate first, we are told, sent for the officer in charge of the execution, and finding from him that Jesus was really dead, granted Joseph's request. Perhaps he desired at the same time to flout the chief priests, and likewise to make some slight reparation to the innocent Victim of his policy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-59.htm">Matthew 27:59</a></div><div class="verse">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Joseph had taken the body.</span> In order to effect this, the cross would be taken up and deposited upon the ground, the nails would be drawn from hands and feet, the cord unbound (if cord there was), and the corpse laid reverently down. We must remember that this act of Joseph and his friends was not only a bold proceeding, but an act of great self-denial. Contact with a corpse caused ceremonial defilement of seven days' duration, and thus they would be debarred from taking their part in the great Paschal solemnity, with its solemn and joyful observances. But the love of Jesus and the unselfish desire to render him honour enabled them to rise superior to religious prejudices, and willingly to make the required sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">Wrapped it in a clean linen cloth;</span> literally, <span class="accented">swathed it in clean linen.</span> The body was enveloped in a sheet of fine linen, pure and clean, as was  fitting. The linen was a fine Indian cloth or muslin, much used for such purposes in Egypt. The body would then be taken to its destination on an open bier. St. John adds the fact that Nicodemus took part in the entombment, bringing a large amount of myrrh and aloes for a temporary embalming, the near approach of the sabbath leaving no time for more elaborate offices. All had to be done with the utmost expedition consistent with propriety and reverence, to avoid encroachment on the rest of that high sabbath. Some of the preparations for burial would doubtless be made in the vestibule of the tomb, which was a small court, but spacious enough for the purpose. Here the limbs would be separately bound with folds of linen, between layers of spices, the head being wrapped in a napkin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a></div><div class="verse">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 60.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Laid it in his own new tomb.</span> It was placed on one of the shelves or recesses formed in the sides of the sepulchre. Thus did the Saviour make "his grave with the wicked" (dying between two thieves), "and with the rich in his death" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). It was fitting that he whose body saw no corruption should be buried in a grave which had never been tainted by a human corpse. Thus also it was ensured that no other body could rise thence except his who alone was buried therein. This tomb, St. John tells us, was quite close at hand, which at that hurried time would be an additional reason for making use of it. <span class="cmt_word">Which he had hewn out in the rock.</span> The tomb was a chamber artificially excavated in the face of the rock, with one entrance only. The wealthy Jews were especially fond of appropriating vaults for the burial of themselves and their families. The neighbourhood of Jerusalem (as other parts of Palestine) abounds with tombs cut in the solid limestone. Recent opinion has veered round to adherence to the traditional site of the holy sepulchre, of which the identification dates from the earliest days; that which is known as "Gordon's tomb" meeting with scant acceptance from experts, and other sites not fully answering the requirements of the case. The existing Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, in the church of that designation, is thus described by Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' pp. 437, etc.): On entering the church, "immediately before you is 'the stone of unction,' said to mark the spot on which our Lord's body was laid in preparation for burial, after being anointed. It is a large slab of limestone A few steps to the left is the place where, as they tell us, the women stood during the anointing, and from this you pass at once, still keeping to the left, into the great round western end of the church - the model of all the circular churches of Europe - under the famous dome, which rests on eighteen pillars, with windows round the circle from which the dome springs. In the centre of this space, which is sixty-seven feet across, is the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, about twenty-six feet long and eighteen feet wide, a tasteless structure of reddish limestone, like marble, decorated all along the top with gilt nosegays and modern pictures, and its front ablaze with countless lamps. Inside it is divided into two parts, the one marking, as is maintained, the spot where the angels stood at the Resurrection, the other believed to contain the sepulchre of Christ In the centre, cased in marble, stands what is called a piece of the stone rolled away by the angel; and at the western end, entered by a low doorway, is the reputed tomb chamber of our Lord, a very small spot, for it is only six feet wide, a few inches longer, and very low. The tomb itself is a raised table, two feet high, three feet wide, and over six feet long, the top of it serving as an altar, over which the darkness is only relieved by the dim lamps." <span class="cmt_word">A great stone.</span> Joseph and his friends closed the entrance to the cave by rolling up to it, and partly in it, a huge stone, to obviate all danger of the sacred body being meddled with by evil beasts or men. The Jewish sepulchres were often furnished with real doors, either of stone or wood, as is proved by existing remains, which show grooves and marks where hinges have been; Joseph's tomb was not thus supplied, either from being still in an unfinished state, or constructed on a different principle. We can not reason from the present state of the sepulchre that it is too unlike what we must conceive the original to have been to permit of the supposed identification. If other criteria point to this site, the difficulties connected with present appearances may be overcome by the consideration that the whole features of the place were altered by Constantine, the Crusaders, and other builders. The surrounding rock has in many parts been cut away, and the surface levelled or lowered, and the only portion left <span class="accented">in situ</span> is the inner chamber where the Lord's body was laid. Captain Conder objects to the traditional site. His own theory, which points to a rock-hewn tomb near the Grotto of Jeremiah, may be seen in the <span class="accented">Quarterly Statement</span> of the Palestine Exploration Fund, April, 1883. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">departed.</span> He had done what he could: sorrowing, he left the place of sepulture. Tradition has traced the later life of Joseph. He is said to have been sent by the Apostle Philip to Britain, in company with other disciples, and to have settled at Glaston bury, in Somersetshire, then much nearer to an arm of the sea than it is now. Here he erected a little oratory of wickerwork,  the first Christian house of prayer that England saw, which was afterwards superseded by the noble abbey whose remains we admire to this day. There is no certain foundation on which the story rests; the only evidence of visitors from Palestine having ever arrived at Glastonbury is the existence of an Eastern thorn tree on Wearyall Hill, which possesses the curious property of blossoming at Christmas. The original tree, which sprang from Joseph's staff, is reported to have flourished till the reign of Charles I., when it was destroyed by the Puritans; but scions or cuttings were taken from it, and many such bushes are still to be found in different parts of the country.

These pious women could not tear themselves from the spot where their Lord was buried. The last to leave him dead, they were the first to see him risen. And now they watch the last ceremonies at a distance, intending to complete the imperfect embalmment with loving care as soon as ever the sabbath was over. "Seest thou women's courage?" says Chrysostom; "seest thou their affection? seest thou their noble spirit in expending money [<a href="../../par/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a>]? their noble spirit even unto death? Let us men imitate the women; let us not forsake Jesus in temptations." We may note that the care of Joseph in providing an inviolable tomb, and the preparations of these good women, showed that they as yet had no faith in the incorruptibility of Christ's body or of his corporeal resurrection from the dead.

The present day was the 15th of Nisan, and both a sabbath and the chief day of the Passover festival. The term "preparation," or "prosabbath" (Judith 8:6), was applied by the Jews to the day preceding the sabbath or the chief festivals (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16:06. 2); but by the time the gospel was committed to writing, Paraskeue had become among Christians the usual designation of the day of Christ's death; hence the sabbath, which was of less importance than the crucifixion day, is here called, "the day after the Paraskeue." The language of the synoptists leads to the conclusion that the action of the Sanhedrists in applying to Pilate took place on the sabbath, their uneasy conscience and fear of some surprising event overcoming that scrupulous regard to the sanctity of the holy day which they would have strictly enforced upon others. It is just possible, however, that they postponed their application till the evening, having nothing to fear till "the third day." <span class="cmt_word">Came together unto Pilate;</span> <span class="accented">were gathered together.</span> A large deputation of the chief men presented itself before the procurator, anxious to obtain his aid to prevent all tampering with the buried body of Jesus, at the same time apprehending some event, they knew not what, which might tend to corroborate his claims. Neologians have argued against the credibility of this section of the gospel history, and have been followed by some commentators of greater faith. A refutation of the most prominent objections will be found in Alford's notes on ver. 62.

Thus they may have heard and partially understood our Lord's allusion to Jonah (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>), or the words on which the false accusation was founded (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); or the apostles themselves may have divulged the mysterious announcement, and a general impression had been produced that Jesus had constantly affirmed that he would rise on the third day. It is true that the apostles and the good women were far from believing in the realization of this assertion in the manner in which it came to pass. They probably looked for Christ's return in glory to establish his kingdom and to reign as Messiah. The rulers received the prediction in its literal sense, "hatred being more keen sighted than love;" hence they took practical precautions against its collusive or pretended fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">That deceiver</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">that vagabond yonder</span>). That impostor, who has become so famous, and whom you know all about. They imply that without further definition, Pilate understands whom they mean; and their calumnies and reviling cease not even with their Victim's death. <span class="cmt_word">While he was yet alive.</span> These bitter enemies of Jesus, who had the best means of ascertaining the truth, certainly regarded him as now dead. Yet some modern sceptics resort to the theory of a trance to account for the Resurrection, whose historical accuracy they cannot gainsay. <span class="cmt_word">After three days.</span> A popular form of expression, which would denote any space which embraced portions of three days, in the present ease being part of Friday, all Saturday, and part of Sunday. <span class="cmt_word">I will rise again</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">I rise</span>).

The rulers had no power in themselves to take the measures which they required. Jesus was a state criminal, and they dared not assume the responsibility of guarding his tomb from invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Until the third day.</span> Which was all that was necessary, as Christ had promised to rise on that day - neither before nor after it; and if it passed without the predicted event, he would be proved to be an impostor. <span class="cmt_word">Come by night</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). This word is absent from the best manuscripts and from the Vulgate. It seems to have been an early interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">And steal him away</span>. A most unlikely hypothesis under the circumstances. The disciples had forsaken Christ while alive, were now hiding in terror, and utterly demoralized and depressed; were they likely to incur further danger for the sake of supporting an assertion, which, unless it proved absolutely true, would only further crush their faith and hope? The rulers seem to have had an uneasy feeling that Jesus might reappear, and they thus prepared themselves to cast discredit upon him, even if, like Lazarus, he rose from the dead. This explanation of the Resurrection has obtained among the Jews from the time of Justin Martyr ('Dial. c. Tryph.,' 17; 108.), and has scarcely yet died out, though in many quarters what is called the "vision<span class="accented">-</span>hypothesis" has taken its place (see on Matthew 28:15, and Edersheim, 2, pp. 626, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The people</span>. The Pharisees were always disdainful of the vulgar herd.

The deception arising from his death and supposed resurrection would be of graver consequence than that concerned with his previous life. Morison, considering the word to have its usual meaning of "error," regards it as used by the Pharisees in a political sense, in accordance with the governor's standpoint: "If that deceiver's body should be stolen by his disciples, the fickle people will undoubtedly leap back to their old conclusion, that after all he was what he professed to be. This conclusion would be, as we all know, an 'error;' but yet it would be most thin, ions to the interests of Caesar. There would be more political disaffection than ever." It is more simple to say that the first error, the acceptance of Christ's Messianic claims, was not of such decided and far-reaching consequence as would be the belief in his resurrection. They do not, indeed, see all that such belief involves; but they understood enough to know that it would give supernatural importance to all the words and acts of his life.

The last words are variously rendered. Thus: "scaled the stone by means of the watch" (Alford); "scaling the stone, the guard being with them" (Revised Version); "as well as having the watch" (Webster and Wilkinson); "in concert with the guard" (Morison). This last expositor has best seized the complex notion contained in the evangelist's language: "They made the sepulchre sure by sealing the stone in concert with the guard (and thereafter leaving the guard to keep watch)." The stone was sealed probably in this manner: a cord was passed round the stone that closed the mouth of the sepulchre to the two sides of the entrance; this was scaled with wax or prepared clay in the centre and at the ends, so that the stone could not be removed without breaking the seals or the cord (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>). Thus carefully did Christ's enemies obviate the possibility of any fraud or collusion; thus did they themselves prove unanswerably the truth and reality of the resurrection of that same Jesus whoso dead body they so carefully guarded. "Everywhere deceit recoils upon itself, and. against its will supports the truth. It was necessary for it to be believed that he died, and that he rose again, and that he was buried, and all these things are brought to pass by his enemies .... The proof of his resurrection has become incontrovertible by what ye [his enemies] have put forward. For because it was sealed, there was no unfair dealing. But if there was no unfair dealing, and the sepulchre was found empty, it is manifest that he is risen, plainly and incontrovertibly.

It is to be noted that there are great and important variations in the four (or, with St. Paul's, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, the five) accounts of the events of the Resurrection, which have given welcome occasion to the sceptic to cast doubts upon the whole transaction. The divergences in the narratives are plainly to be ascribed to the facts that the writers did not depend upon one another, nor draw their accounts from one source; that each gives only an incomplete history, introducing those details with which he was familiar, or which it suited his plan to recount. On all main points the agreement is perfect, and every difference could be easily reconciled, if we knew the whole of the circumstances and the exact sequence of each word and act during this momentous period. Attempts at harmonizing the various accounts have been made with more or less success by writers from St. Augustine to the present time; but as they vary in many particulars, and have no authoritative basis, dependence cannot be placed upon them. The narrative in St. Matthew is brief and imperfect, and we shall chiefly confine our remarks to the exposition of the actual text before us, without importing much matter from the other evangelists. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the end of the sabbath</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">late on the sabbath</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">vespere sabbati.</span> The expression is obscure. In the parallel passage of St. Mark we read, "When the sabbath was past." We must take it that St. Matthew is thinking of the sabbath as extending, not from evening to evening, but till the following morning. "So that it is not the accurate Jewish division of time, according to which the sabbath ended at six on Saturday evening, but the ordinary civil idea of a day, which extended from sunrise to sunrise (or at least adds the night to the preceding day)" (Lange). We have, then, now arrived at the commencement of the first Christian Easter Day. As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">in prima sabbati</span> (Vulgate); literally, <span class="accented">unto one day of sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one day after the sabbath, the Jews reckoning their days in sequence from the sabbath, and Christians at first carrying on the same practice, as we see in <a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>. Later Christians named the days of the week in sequence from the Sunday, which was the first day, Monday being the second day, <span class="accented">feria secunda</span>, and so on. <span class="cmt_word">Came Mary Magdalene</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the other Mary</span> (see on Matthew 27:61) <span class="cmt_word">to</span> <span class="cmt_word">see the sepulchre</span>. Love cannot abandon its object, living or dead. There were probably other women with these two, or perhaps there were two separate bands of women who in this early morning visited the sepulchre. Among these Mary Magdalene stands prominently forward, first in love and first in care. She and the rest evidently knew nothing of the sealing of the stone or the posting of the guards. St. Matthew's expression, "to see (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to gaze upon," "contemplate") the sepulchre," conveys only a partial notice of the object of their visit. They came not only to take a view of the tomb, but also to embalm the Lord's body, for which necessary preparations had been made, the approach of the sabbath on the evening of the Crucifixion having cut short the arrangements. We know from St. Mark that they were perplexed about the difficulty of removing the stone, and St. Matthew may be referring to a preliminary inspection made in regard of this impediment. Our Gospel omits mention of the intention of embalming the corpse, as the Resurrection rendered it impracticable; and, indeed, the Lord's body had already been anointed for his burial by Mary of Bethany. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> A wonderful sight met their eyes. The following event took place before their arrival; they saw only the result. No mortal eye beheld, and no pen has recorded, the actual issuing of the Lord from the closed tomb. <span class="cmt_word">There was a great earthquake.</span> St. Matthew does not attempt to give the exact sequence of events. Probably the shock, caused by the sudden advent and action of the angel, befell as the women were approaching the cemetery. Christ had risen before this occurrence, nothing being a barrier to his spiritual body. <span class="cmt_word">For the angel of the Lord...  from the door.</span> The narrator accounts for the phenomenon just mentioned. The words, "from the door," are omitted by the best manuscripts, the Vulgate, and modern editors, and seem to be a marginal interpolation. The angel rolled away the stone which Joseph had rolled up (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>), not in order to afford passage to the body of the Lord, who had already raised himself, but to give the women and others entrance to the empty tomb, and to strike terror into the heart of the soldiers. In the case of  Lazarus the stone had to be removed to give exit to the resuscitated body - a natural body (<a href="../../par/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39, 41</a>); in the case of Jesus such removal was not necessary, as his was a spiritual body, possessed of supernatural powers and qualities (<a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat upon it</span>. In triumph, and to show that it was not to be replaced; death had done its work, and now was vanquished. Angels' appearances had always accompanied the great events in the history of the chosen people; angels had shown themselves at Christ's birth, at his temptation, at his agony; now they guard his tomb, proving that he was well pleasing unto the Lord, and was raised from the grave by him. The narration of this awful incident was probably given by the soldiers, who alone witnessed it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a></div><div class="verse">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His countenance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) was like lightning. The angel's aspect was as bright and startling as the flash of lightning (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-14.htm">Ezekiel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His raiment white as snow.</span> Pure and glistening, like the effect of the Transfiguration on the Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>).

It would seem, from this expression, that the soldiers were sensible, not only of the earthquake and the movement of the stone, but also of the presence of the heavenly messenger, in this respect differing from the companions of Daniel and St. Paul, who were only partially conscious of the visions beheld by the two saints (see <a href="../../par/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did shake.</span> The verb is cognate with the noun "earthquake;" they were shaken, convulsed with terror. If these were some of the company that had watched the Crucifixion, they were already possessed of some feeling respecting the unearthly nature of the Occupant of the tomb which they were guarding, and had a vague expectation of something that might happen. At any rate, they must have heard the late events discussed by their comrades, and were not without apprehension of a catastrophe. Became as dead men. They fell to the ground in deathlike faintness, and, when they recovered from the trance, fled in terror from the tomb into the city (ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel answered and said.</span> The women arrived probably while the guards were lying unconscious on the ground. They saw them, and they saw the angel rotting on the stone, or, according to St. Mark, "a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe;" St. Luke says that "two men stood by them in dazzling apparel," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> first one had shown himself, and then another. Doubtless innumerable angels were thronging around, and one or more became visible to certain persons as they were capable of receiving spiritual impressions, or as these spirits were directed to show themselves. The women spake not, were too affrighted to ask questions; but their amazed look, their blank surprise, were themselves interrogative, and the angel replied to their inward emotion. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not ye</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic). The soldiers have cause to fear; they are the enemies of the Lord; but ye are his friends, and need feel no alarm. <span class="cmt_word">Ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span> Ye are seeking him, to do honour to his body; I know your pious intention, but it is useless. The angel shrinks not from the mention of Christ's shameful death, which is now his glory, "the power of God and the wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23, 24</a>). "It was the good pleasure of the Father . .. through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross...  whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19, 20</a>). The crucifixion "was not simply a temporary incident in the life of Christ. It is an eternal principle in his kingdom" (Milligan). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a></div><div class="verse">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is not here.</span> He is not in this tomb; his bodily presence is removed from this his whilom resting place. St. Matthew's account is greatly condensed, and omits many details which harmonists try to fit into our text. The attempt is not to be commended, for it really involves greater confusion, and, after all, is forced and only conjectural. <span class="cmt_word">For he is risen, as he said.</span> If they had believed Christ's often-repeated announcement, they would not have come seeking the living among the dead. (For Christ's predictions concerning his resurrection, see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-23.htm">Matthew 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>.) On this simple, but pregnant sentence, "He is risen," depends the phenomenon of Christianity, in its origin, existence, continuance, extension, and moral power. "Death began with woman; and to women the first announcement is made of resurrection" (Hilary, quoted by Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> The angel invites them to satisfy themselves that Christ's body was no longer in its resting place. That Jesus was designated as "the Lord," <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by the disciples is obvious (see <a href="../../par/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, etc.), but it is doubtful whether the words are genuine here, though they are found in many good manuscripts and in the Vulgate. They are omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, 33, etc., and by Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort in their editions. Regarding them as genuine, Bengel calls them "gloriosa appellatio," which indeed it is, for it is equivalent to "Jehovah." Harmonists suppose that the  angel was at first not seen by the women; that Mary Magdalene, observing the stone removed, at once hurried to the city to tell Peter and John; that, the rest of the women remaining, the angel made himself visible to them and bade them enter the sepulchre; and that, doing so, they beheld another angel sitting on the right side of the recess. Thus, it is conjectured, the accounts in Mark and John may be harmonized with that in our text. (See also Westcott on <a href="../../par/john/20.htm">John 20</a>, where is given a provisional arrangement of the facts of the first Easter Day.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7</a></div><div class="verse">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go quickly, and tell his disciples.</span> St. Mark significantly adds, "and Peter." The disciples were to believe without seeing. They had deserted Christ in his hour of need, had not stood by the cross, nor aided in his burial; so they were not to be honoured with the vision of angels or the first sight of the risen Lord. This was reserved for the faithful women, who thus received their mission to carry a message to the messengers - a foretaste of the ministry which they should perform in the Church of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">He goeth before you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">into Galilee.</span> The verb is noticeable. It is that used by our Lord himself on his way to the garden of Gethsemane (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>), and it implies the act of a shepherd at the head of his flock, leading them to new pastures (comp. <a href="../../par/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>). The good Shepherd had been smitten, and the sheep scattered; now under his guidance they were to be reunited. The apostolic band had been temporarily dissolved and disintegrated; the college was again to be reformed, and was to receive its renewed commission in seclusion and peace, that it might return to Jerusalem with unimpaired strength to commence its arduous labours. The place of meeting is in Galilee, where most of his mighty works were done, and where it was safer for the disciples to assemble than at Jerusalem. The majority of them came from this region, and thither they returned some ten days (<a href="../../par/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1-4</a>) after the Resurrection, to resume their ordinary occupations (ver. 16). Thus they would realize that it was the same Jesus who met them there with whom, these three past years, they had held familiar intercourse. It was ordained, for some reason not expressly stated, that from Galilee should proceed Christ's spiritual kingdom which he came to establish - that "word which," as Peter said (<a href="../../par/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37</a>), "was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee." We read of only two appearances of Christ in Galilee - once at the lake, mentioned in the last chapter of St. John, and again in ver. 17 of this chapter of St. Matthew. It is, however, possible that the appearance named by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), when he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at one time, may have occurred in Galilee. If this is the case, it would be remarkable as the only public revelation of Christ after his resurrection, and the comparative seclusion of the northern district may have been one reason for its selection as the scene for this great demonstration. There was doubtless some moral fitness in the humble and despised Galilee being made the starting point of his Church who was despised and rejected of men whom it was contemptuously said, "Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?" (<a href="../../par/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a>). "As in all things God sets at naught the pride of mankind, and chooses persons, instruments, and places mean in the eves of the world, teaching us that in humbler and more retired abodes, secret from the world, we are to seek for the strength of God, who hideth himself" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I have told you.</span> The angel thus solemnly confirms what he had just said. The Authorized Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Ecce, praedixi vobis</span>, which is warranted by no existing Greek manuscripts, the uniform reading of the original being <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>

It is not quite in St. Matthew's style, and seems to be rightly regarded as a gloss There is. one advantage in its omission, in that the actual moment of this appearance of our Lord is left undecided, and we are at liberty to harmonize it, if so minded, with other details. Now the women, according to our history, receive the reward of their faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail!</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">Rejoice ye!</span> This is not the usual Eastern salutation, "Peace be unto you!" but one that came with peculiar significance on their lately sorrow-stricken hearts. So he had said to his apostles, "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" (<a href="../../par/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>), and now he made good his word. This is the only one of Christ's appearances in Jerusalem or its neighbourhood. that St. Matthew relates. <span class="cmt_word">They came and</span>  <span class="cmt_word">held him by the feet</span> (<span class="accented">took hold of his feet</span>). As soon as they saw him, they went to him with glad surprise, and yet with such awe, that they could only fall down before him and tenderly clasp his feet. He had appeared before this to Mary Magdalene (<a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>), but had not permitted her to touch him because he had not yet ascended to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), implying thereby either that she would have other opportunities of holding converse with him, as he was not going to leave the earth immediately, and she must not detain him now; or, more probably, that the spiritual body demanded, not the touch of earthly affection, but the attitude of awe and reverence, and that all future contact would be supernatural and spiritual, realizing his presence after a heavenly and supersensuous manner by faith. But these women clung to Christ with something higher than natural, earthly affection, acknowledging his superhumanity, and he allowed them, like Thomas, to assure themselves of his corporeity by touch as well as sight. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> They remained at his feet in profound adoration.

Why St. Matthew mentions none of these we may form conjectures, but we cannot determine (see on ver. 16).

This account takes up the narrative of <a href="../../par/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63-66</a> and ver. 4 of this chapter. As soon as they recovered from their swoon and had assured themselves that the tomb was empty, the soldiers hurried in affright to the Jewish rulers, under whose orders they had temporarily been placed, and told them <span class="cmt_word">all the things that were done.</span> They could speak of the earthquake, of the appearing of the angel, of the removal of the stone, of the absence of the body which they were appointed to watch. Their task was done; the corpse was gone, they knew not how taken; they could not be expected to contend with supernatural visitants, or to guard against supernatural occurrences. St. Matthew seems to have introduced this incident in order to account for the prevalence of the lying rumour which he proceeds to mention, and which had been widely disseminated among his countrymen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-12.htm">Matthew 28:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the chief priests) <span class="cmt_word">were assembled with the elders.</span> On hearing the report of the soldiers, the Sanhedrists held a hurried and informal meeting, to consult about this alarming matter. It would be fatal to their policy to let the real truth get wind. Such testimony from unprejudiced heathens would infallibly convince the people of the validity of Christ's claims, and produce the very effect which their unusual precautions had been intended to obviate. One course alone remained, and that was to prepare a circumstantial lie concerning one part of the story, and to deny or ignore utterly the supernatural details. The plainest evidence will not persuade against wilful blindness. These rulers acted according to Christ's sad foreboding on another occasion, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They gave large money</span> (<span class="accented">money enough</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto the soldiers.</span> They bribed the soldiers with a sum of money sufficient to satisfy their cupidity. This they did personally, or more probably through some trusty agent. They never doubted the facts to which the guards bore witness; they never attempted to discredit their story by suggestion of error or superstitious invention. They accepted the tale, and took most dishonourable means to make it innocuous. They had bought the aid of the traitor Judas; they now buy the silence of these soldiers. It. is suggested by St. Jerome that in both cases they made use of the temple funds, thus employing against the cause of God that which was devoted to his service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-13.htm">Matthew 28:13</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye,</span> etc. They put the lie into the soldiers' mouth, directing them to  answer inquiries in this way. The last resource of an infatuated obstinacy! If they were asleep, how could they know that the disciples stole the body? St. Chrysostom comments well on the infamous transaction, "How did they steal him? O most foolish of all men! For because of the clearness and conspicuousness of the truth, they are not even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed, what they said was highly incredible, and the falsehood had not even speciousness. For how, I ask, did the disciples steal him, men poor and unlearned, and not venturing so much as to show themselves? What? was not a seal put upon it? What? were there not many watchmen and soldiers and Jews stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect this very thing, and take thought, and break their rest, and are in anxiety about it? And wherefore, moreover, did they steal it? That they might feign the doctrine of the resurrection? And how should it enter their minds to feign such a thing - men who were well content to be hidden and to live? And how could they remove the stone that was made sure? How could they have escaped the observation of so many? Nay, though they had despised death, they would not have attempted without purpose and fruitlessly to venture in defiance of so many who were on the watch. And that moreover they were timorous, what they had done before showed clearly: at least, when they saw him seized, all rushed away from him. If, then, at that time they did not dare so much as to stand their ground when they saw him alive, how when he was dead could they but have feared such a number of soldiers?" ('Hem.,' 90.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-14.htm">Matthew 28:14</a></div><div class="verse">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if this come to the governor's ears</span>; <span class="accented">if this be heard before the governor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if the matter be brought officially before the procurator. For a Roman soldier to sleep on his post was to incur the penalty of death. Pilate would not be likely to hear of what had taken place, as vulgar rumours were not encouraged by his stern and unsympathizing attitude towards the Jewish people, but it was just possible that some officious person might bring the report before him, and ask him to take measures to ascertain the truth, and, if necessary, to punish the delinquents. <span class="cmt_word">We</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">will persuade him.</span> Such persuasion usually took the form of bribery, Roman officials being notoriously venal (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26</a>); but perhaps the rulers intended to make him believe that the story was not true, but merely a <span class="accented">ruse</span> to keep the populace quiet.

Pilate, however, later learned the great fact of Christ's resurrection, and though, as far as we know, he took no steps towards punishing the guard (being probably convinced of its supernatural occurrence), yet, according to a fragment of Hegesippus, and Eusebius, 'Chronic.,' 2:2, he sent an account of the matter to Tiberius, who, in consequence, endeavoured to make the senate pass a decree enrolling Jesus in the list of Roman gods. This fact is attested by Tertullian ('Apolog.,' 5.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a></div><div class="verse">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This saying;</span> viz. the theft of the body by the disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Is commonly reported</span> (<span class="accented">was spread abroad</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>among the Jews until this day;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and continues to be reported until this day. This was true when St. Matthew wrote, and it is true at the present time, though thoughtful Jews of late years have adopted the idea that the apostles, in their excited state, were deceived by visions of Christ which they took for substantial realities (see on Matthew 27:64). In the passage of Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Tryph.,' 108.) we are told that the Jews sent emissaries in all directions to spread this false report. The evangelist shows the origin of this most improbable tale, and virtually challenges any other explanation of the miracle than the authentic one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Our Lord appears to the disciples in Galilee, and gives them a commission to teach and baptize.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew; but comp. <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-18</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the eleven disciples.</span> There is no note of time in the original, which gives merely, <span class="accented">But the eleven</span>, etc. The meeting here narrated took place on some day after the first Easter week. The number "eleven" shows the loss of one of the sacred college, whose complement was not filled up till just before Pentecost (<a href="../../par/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went away into Galilee.</span> St. Matthew takes pains to show the exact fulfilment of Christ's very special injunction and promise concerning Galilee (see vers. 7, 10, and notes there, and <a href="../../par/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>). The evangelist's object being to set forth Christ in his character as King and Lawgiver, he puts aside all other incidents in order to give prominence to this appearance, where Jesus announces his supreme authority (ver. 18), gives the commission to his apostles, and promises his perpetual presence (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the mountain</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>where</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus had appointed them</span>. We do not know the locality intended, though it must have been some spot familiar to the disciples, and was probably plainly  designated at the time when Christ appointed the meeting. Some have fixed on Tabor as the scene of this revelation, others on the Mount of Beatitudes; but where nothing is stated it is best to lay aside conjecture and accept the designed indefiniteness. Many commentators have determined that this appearance on the Galilaean mountain was that mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), as manifested to five hundred brethren at once. This is a mere conjecture, probable, but not certain. If it was the case, we must consider that St. Matthew singles out the eleven apostles as the most eminent among the company, and those to whom the Lord specially addressed the commission which he mentions. Of the five hundred brethren, St. Paul, writing some twenty years or more after this time, testifies that the greater number were still alive, only some having "fallen asleep." There never was, indeed, any historical fact the authenticity of which was more remarkably and irrefragably certified than the resurrection of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They worshipped him.</span> Evidently here they, or the majority of those present (for it is plain that others beside the apostles were there), adored him as God and Lord. This is the first time that this action of supreme worship is mentioned in connection with the disciples, though the women had offered the same homage to him (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">some doubted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> - without <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). (For the verb, comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>.) The doubters could not have been any of the eleven, for they had seen the Lord more than once at Jerusalem, and had had indubitable proofs that he had risen from the dead, and was no mere spirit or spiritual appearance, but possessed of his former body, with new powers, faculties, and laws. Those who for the moment doubted did not hesitate to acknowledge his resurrection, but his identity. They were, perhaps, at a distance. Christ may have appeared surrounded with heavenly glory; at any rate, in a shape, or vesture, or with an aspect with which they were not familiar; hence in this majestic form, they failed to recognize the "despised and rejected of men," the lowly Jesus whom they had known (cf. <a href="../../par/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus came.</span> Some medieval exegetes have deemed that this verse refers to the time of the ascension; but there is no valid reason for dissociating this portion from the rest of the account. If we do this, we lose the great reason for the oft-enjoined meeting on the Galilaean mountain, which seems to have been expressly and with much care arranged to notify at large the fact of Christ's Resurrection and of his supreme authority, and to convey the Lord's commission to the apostles in the presence of many witnesses. We may suppose that Jesus, who had been standing apart, now drew near <span class="cmt_word">to</span> the company, so that all, especially the doubting, might see him closely and hear his familiar voice. <span class="cmt_word">Spake unto them</span> (<span class="greek_word">e)lalhsen au)toi  =  </span>, <span class="accented">talked unto them</span>). Doubtless he said much more than is here recorded, resolving doubts, confirming faith, infusing comfort. "Thus it is even now; we worship him, and then he draws near, and, by his nearer approaches and secret manifestation of himself to our hearts, we are confirmed in the faith, and see in him God and man" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">All power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is given (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">was given</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto me in</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven and in earth.</span> Jesus here asserts that he, as Son of man, has received from the Father supreme authority in heaven and earth, over the whole kingdom of God in its fullest extent. This is net given to him as Son o! God; for, as God, naught can be added to him or taken from him; it is a power which he has merited by his incarnation, death, and Passion (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-10</a>), which was foretold in the Old Testament, by psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5-8</a>) and prophet (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>), and with which he was indued on the day that he rose victorious from the grave. So the verb "was given" is in the past tense, because it refers to the dotation arranged in God's eternal purpose, and to the actual investiture at the Resurrection. The power is exercised in his mediatorial kingdom, and will continue to be exercised till he hath put all enemies under his feet, and destroyed death itself (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-27</a>); but his absolute kingdom is everlasting; as God and Man he reigns forever and ever. This mediatorial authority extends not only over men, so that he governs and protects the Church, disposes bureau events, controls hearts and opinions; but the forces of heaven also are at his command, the Holy Spirit is bestowed by him, the angels are in his employ as ministering to the members of his body. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a></div><div class="verse">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>). The illative particle is perhaps spurious, but it is implied by what has preceded. It is because Jesus has plenary authority, and can delegate power to whom he will, that he confers the following commission. He is addressing the eleven apostles, of whom alone St. Matthew makes mention (ver. 16); but as they personally could not execute the grand commission in all its extent and duration, he lays his commands upon their representatives and successors in all ages. They were to go forth, and carry the gospel throughout the world. Doubtless herein is implied the duty of all Christians to be in some sense missionaries, to use their utmost efforts to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ, and to make men obedient to his Law. The  propagation of the gospel is a work for all in their several spheres. <span class="cmt_word">Teach</span>; <span class="accented">docete</span> (Vulgate). These are unfortunate renderings of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which means, "make disciples." Teaching is expressed in ver. 20, as one of the elements or components of full discipleship. The imperative aorist <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is, as it were, decomposed by the two following present participles, "baptizing" and "teaching." In the case of infants the process is exactly what is here represented; they are admitted into the Christian society by baptism, and then instructed in faith and duty. Adults have to be instructed before baptism; but they form a small minority in most Christian communities, where, generally, infant baptism is the rule, and would be regarded rather as exceptions. Teaching alone is not stated by the Lord to be the only thing necessary to convert an unbeliever into a Christian; this is effected by the grace of God applied as Christ proceeds to explain. <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;</span>). The apostles were no longer to go only to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>); they were to Christianize all the nations of the world, Jew and Gentile alike. The gospel is adapted to all the varying minds and habits of men, barbarous and civilized, near and remote, ignorant or cultivated; and it is the duty and privilege of Christ's ministers to make it known and acceptable in all quarters of the globe. <span class="cmt_word">Baptizing them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> individuals of all the nations. The present participle denotes the mode of initiation into discipleship. Make them disciples by baptizing them. Christ thus explains his mysterious announcement to Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." To the disciples the notion of baptism was no new thing. As a rite typifying the cleansing of the heart and the purpose of leading a new life, it had been long practised in the case of proselytes to the Jewish faith; they had seen it employed by John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>), and had used it themselves (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>). Christ adopts the old rite, gives it a new solemnity, a most sacred formula of administration, a new meaning, new spiritual effects. The persons to whom and in whose presence he spoke would understand his injunction as applicable to all who were capable of its reception, children and adults, the subjects of the initiatory ceremony of proselytism. There was no need of closer specification. Or, if any such instruction was needed, the rules concerning circumcision would be a sufficient guide. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</span>. Our version follows the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in nomine</span>, which does not give the right force to the expression. The phrase does not mean merely invoking the Name, under the sanction of the great Name, but something more than this. It signifies into the power and influence of the Holy Trinity, into faith in the three Persons of God, and the duties and privileges consequent on that faith, into the family of God and obedience unto its Head. The "into" shows the end and aim of the consecration of baptism. The "Name" of God is that by which he is known to us - that which connotes his being and his attributes, that by which there exists a conscious connection between God and ourselves (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). So being baptized into the Name of God implies being placed in subjection to and communion with God himself, admitted into covenant with him. It is to be observed that the term is "name," not "names," thus denoting the unity of the Godhead in the trinity of Persons. The Lord's words have always been taken as the formula of baptism, and have in all ages been used in its administration. The three Divine Persons were revealed at the baptism of Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>); they are invoked at every Christian baptism. It is true that we read, in the early Church, of persons being baptized "in the Name of the Lord Jesus," and "in the Name of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-16.htm">Acts 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-48.htm">Acts 10:48</a>); but this expression by no means assumes that the names of the other Divine Persons were not used; it denotes that the converts were admitted into the religion which Jesus instituted, in fact, were made Christians. The above formula has from primitive times been considered indispensable for the valid administration of this sacrament (see 'Apost. Can.,' 41; Tertull., 'De Bapt.,' 13; Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 1:79). "From this sacred form of baptism," says Bishop Pearson, "did the Church derive the rule of faith, requiring the profession of belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, before they could be baptized in their Name" ('On the Creed,' art. 1.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a></div><div class="verse">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i>even</i> unto the end of the world.

Instruction is the second necessary condition for discipleship. In the case of adults, as was said above, some teaching must precede the initiation; but this has to be supplemented subsequently in order to build up the convert in the faith and make him perfect; while infants must be taught "as soon as they are able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they have here  made." All must be taught the Christian faith and duty, and how to obtain God's help to enable them to please him, and to continue in the way of salvation, so that they may "die from sin, and rise again unto righteousness; continually mortifying all their evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of living" ('Public Baptism of Infants'). "He gives," says St. Chrysostom, "the one charge with a view to doctrine [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the form of baptism], the other concerning commandments" ('Horn.,' 90.). All that Christ commanded, both in doctrine and morals, all that he had taught and enjoined during the three past years, they were henceforward to take as their textbook, and enforce on all who were admitted into the Church by baptism. As the Greek is, "I commanded," being aorist and not perfect, it may be rightly opined that Christ here alludes also to various details which he set forth and enjoined during these great forty days, between his resurrection and ascension, when he gave commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen, and spake to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God (<a href="../../par/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo.</span> "After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage, he <span class="accented">says.</span> Lo! "etc. (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">I am with you alway</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Every word is emphatic. The Ascension was at hand; this implied an absence of his visible presence, to be replaced by a spiritual presence, more perfect, potent, effectual, infinite. It is I myself, I, God and Man,who am (not "will be") henceforward ever present among you, with you as Companion, Friend, Guide, Saviour, God. I am with you in all your ministrations, prayers public and private, baptisms, communions, exhortations, doctrine, discipline And this, not now and then, not at certain times only, but "all the days" of your pilgrimage, all the dark days of trial and persecution and affliction; all the days when you, my apostles, are gathered to your rest, and have committed your work to other hands; my presence shall never be withdrawn for a single moment. Often had God made an analogous promise to his servants under the old dispensation - to Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), to Joshua (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), to Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>); but this spiritual presence of Christ is something unknown to previous history, a nearness unspeakable, in the Church at large and in the Christian's heart. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the end of the world;</span> <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span>, as <a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> (where see note).

The First Gospel, if taken alone  would give the impression that Joseph had had no previous connexion with Nazareth. But about the place where Joseph and Mary lived before the birth of Jesus the evangelist did not concern himself (cf ver. 23, note). <span class="cmt_word">Of Judaea</span>. For the evangelist's purpose it was most important so to define it as to exclude Bethlehem of Zebulun (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). The inhabitants of Bethlehem of Judaea, a market town of a fruitful (Ephratah) district, live chiefly by agriculture, but also for several centuries have manufactured images of saints, rosaries, and fancy articles. Since 1834: it has been almost exclusively occupied by Christians (Socin's Baedeker,' p. 243, seq.). From "the House of Bread" came forth" the true Bread." <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Herod the king</span>. Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa II. (<a href="../../par/acts/25-13.htm">Acts 25:13</a>) alone held the legal title of "king" for any time (but cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>, note) - the former as King of the Jews (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:14.4), or King "of the Idumaeans and Samaritans" (Appian, 'Civ., 5:75; <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, 1:1. 340), by a decree of an express meeting of the Roman senate,  <span class="date">B.C. 40</span>; the latter by Claudius's appointment, as king first of Chalcis (A.D. 48-53) and afterwards (A.D. 53-100) of the tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:12. 8; 13. 2), although Herod Antipas was so spoken of by courtesy ( <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">As</span> the date of Agrippa II. is quite out of the question, we are almost compelled by this phrase alone to recognize the date of Christ's birth as falling in the lifetime of Herod the Great. Herod the Great died in the spring of A.U.C. 750, our  <span class="date">B.C. 4</span> (Schiirer, 1:1. 466), and as our Lord was born at least forty days earlier, for the purification in the temple must have taken place before Herod's massacre of the innocents, he cannot have been born later than the very beginning of  <span class="date">B.C. 4</span>, or the end of  <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>. Indeed, upon the most natural deduction from ver. 16, he must have been born some months earlier. The Church, from the days of Justin Martyr ('Ap.,' 1:32), has loved to see in the abolition by Rome of the kingdom of the Jews at the death of Herod, of its native dynasty by Herod's usurnation (Origen, 'Genesis Hom.,' 17:6), the fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there came Wise Men from the East</span>. The true order, as given in the Revised Version, lays the emphasis on the office, and in a subordinate degree on the home of the strangers <span class="accented">- Wise Men from the East came.</span> This translation also hints at the full meaning of the verb ( <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) , of which the connotation is not of the place a quo, but of the publicity of their appearance at the place <span class="accented">in quo</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). <span class="accented">Wise Men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); "astromyens" (Wickliffe); "<span class="accented">rages"</span> (Rheims). On this word see especially Schrader ('Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament') on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. He considers it to be in origin not Iranian (Medo-Persian), but Babylonian, and to have primarily meant either "<span class="accented">one</span> who is deep whether in power and reputation or in insight," or one who has fulness of power. It was, perhaps, at first used with special reference to astrologers and interpreters of dreams, and, passing from Babylonia to Media, it became the name of the Median priestly order. In the latter sense it is probably used here. In <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-8</a> it, apparently by reversion, is used in its wider meaning. Of the number and rank of those who now came absolutely nothing is known. Of greater importance is Cicero's statement ('De Div.,' 1:41), "Nee quisquam rex Persarum potest esse, qui non ante magorum disciplinam scientiamque perceperit." These Magi <span class="accented">spontaneously</span> submit to the Babe. <span class="accented">From the East.</span> The proper home of the Magi would thus be Media, and, from the length of time employed on their journey (ver. 16), it is probable that by "the East" we must here understand Media or some other part of the kingdom, of Parthia, into which Media had been mostly absorbed, and in which, in fact, the Magi were now greatly honoured. <span class="accented">Many</span>, <span class="accented">however</span> (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebr.'; and Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:203, who points out that a Jewish kingdom of Yemen then existed), think that these Magi came from Arabia; and with this the tradition, evidently received by Justin Martyr and frequently referred to by him ( <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, 'Trypho,' &sect;&sect; 77, 78, 88, 102; cf. Reseh, 'Agrapha,' p. 471), perhaps agrees. But Justin's own opinion was that they came from Damascus, which "was and is a part of the land of Arabia" (&sect; 78). It is noticeable that Justin's tradition is confirmed by the Jerusalem Talmud ('Ber.,' 2:4), which makes an "Arabian" tell a Jew that Messiah is born. The whole passage is worth quoting for its illustration of several details in this chapter. "After this the children of Israel shall be converted, and shall inquire after the Lord their God, and David their king (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). Our rabbins say, 'That is King Messias, if he be among the living, his name is David, or if dead, David is his name.' Rabbi Tanchum said, 'Thus I prove it: He sheweth mercy to David his Messiah' (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). Rabbi Josua ben Levi saith, 'His name is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span>, a Branch (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>).' Rabbi Judah bar Aibu saith, ' His name is Menahem (that is, <span class="accented">Para>klhtov</span>, the Comforter).' And that which happened to a certain Jew, as he was ploughing, agreeth with this business. A certain Arabian travelling, and hearing the ox bellow, said to the Jew at plough,  'O Jew, loose thy oxen, and loose thy ploughs, for, behold, the temple is laid waste!' The ox bellowed the second time; the Arabian saith to him, 'O Jew, Jew, yoke thy oxen, and fit thy ploughs: for, behold, King Messiah is born!' But saith the Jew, 'What is his name?' 'Menahem,' saith he. 'And what is the name of his father?' 'Hezekiah,' saith the Arabian. To whom the Jew, 'But whence is he?' The other answered, ' From the palace of the King of Bethlehem-Judah.' Away he went, and sold his oxen, and his ploughs, and became a seller of infants' swaddling-clothes, going about from town to town. When he came to that city (Bethlehem) all the women bought of him, but the mother of Menahem bought nothing. He heard the voice of the women saying, 'O thou mother of Menahem, thou mother of Menahem, carry thy son the things that are here sold.' But she replied, 'May the enemies of Israel be strandded, because on the day that he was born the temple was laid waste.' To whom he said, 'But we hoped, that as it was laid waste at his feet, so at his feet it would be built again.' She saith, 'I have no money.' To whom he replied, 'But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry him what you buy here, and if you have no money to-day, after some days I will come back and receive it.' After some days he returns to that city, and saith to her, 'How does the little infant?' And she said, 'From the time you saw me last, spirits [winds] and tempests came, and snatched him away out of my hands.' Rabbi Bon saith, 'What need have we to learn from an Arabian? Is it not plainly written, "And Lebanon shall fall before the Powerful One?" (Esa. 10:34). And what follows after? "A Branch shall come out of the root of Jesse" (Esa. 11:1)'" ('Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) . To Jerusalem. The capital, where this King would reign, and where information about his birth would most naturally be obtained.

In the way of their ordinary pursuits they learned of Christ. The observation of nature led them to nature's Bond (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). What this star really was has been the subject of much consideration without any very satisfactory result. The principal theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, which took place in May to July and again in September,  <span class="date">B.C. 7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It was the rising of Sirius on the same day in the fifth, fourth, third, and second years B.C. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It was some strange evanescent star such as Kepler saw in 1603-4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Astronomy can suggest nothing which satisfies all the conditions, and the appearance must have been strictly miraculous. Since Professor Pritchard's article in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' this last has been generally accepted in England. A further question is - How came they to identify the star as "his"? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What made the Magi connect the coming of the King of the Jews with a star? and what made them consider that this particular appearance was the one they expected? The latter part of the question can hardly be answered, except on the supposition that the star that they saw was in itself so extraordinary as to convince them that no greater star could be looked for. To the former part various answers have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Balaam's prophecy (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) was understood literally, and the knowledge of it, with its misinterpretation, had spread to the Magi. For this literal interpretation, cf. the 'Pesikta Zutarta' ('Lekah Tob') on <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> (p. 58, Venice edit.), where it says that in the fifth year of the heptad before Messiah "the star" shall shine forth from the east,, and this is the star of the Messiah (cf. also Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:212). Similarly we find  the false Messiah of the second century applying the term to himself - "Barcochab." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They had learned, by intercourse with Jews (cf. the influence of the Jewish Sibylline oracles on the fourth eclogue), that these latter expected a great King, and they had applied to his coming, as to all events, the science that they themselves practised. They believed fully in astrology, and the Divine ordering that a star should appear to them was a condescension to the then state of human knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">In the East</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). Ellicott points out ('Hist. Lects.,' p. 73) that to translate this "at its rising" seems to be at needless variance with the use of the same words in ver. 9, where they seem to stand in a kind of <span class="accented">local</span> antithesis to "where the young Child was." For the phrase as referring to the Eastern part of the earth, cf. Clem. Romans, &sect; 5. It is more definite than the plural of ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">And are come</span>.

Fully in accordance with his jealous and suspicious character. For he had already slain, as actual or possible candidates for the throne, five of the Maccabean princes and princesses, including his favourite wife Mariamne (thus extirpating the direct line) and also his two sons by Mariamne. Josephus ('Ant.,' 17:02. 4; cf. Holtzmann) mentions a prediction of the Pharisees towards the end of Herod's life, that "God had decreed that Herod's government should cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it." This seems to have a Messianic reference, though used at the time for an intrigue in favour of Pheroras, Herod's brother. <span class="cmt_word">And all Jerusalem</span>.

The reason for the inhabitants of Jerusalem feeling troubled is generally explained, by their fear, which was in fact only too well justified by experience, that the news would excite Herod to fresh crimes. It is also possible that many would shrink from the changes which the coming of Messiah could not but bring. Present ease, though only comparative, is with the unbelieving preferable to possibilities of the highest blessedness. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a> affords both a parallel and a contrast. <span class="cmt_word">With him</span>.

The addition helped to bring out the evangelist's thought that the representatives of the chosen people (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>) were fully informed of the coming of Christ.

The width of the term "all," and the double classification, seem to point to this not being a meeting of the Sanhedrin as such. Herod called an informal and perhaps the more comprehensive meeting of those who could assist him. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">demanded of them</span>; Revised Version, in<span class="accented">quired</span>, for "demand" is, in modern English, too strong for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> The tyrant could be courteous when it served his purpose.

Here on his birth as connected with his origin The present is chosen, not the future, because Herod is stating a theological question without reference to time. Observe, in Herod's inquiry and subsequent action, the combination of superstition and irreligion. He was willing to accept the witness of stars and of prophecies, but not willing to allow himself to be morally influenced by it. His attempt to kill this Child was the expression of a desire to destroy the Jewish nationality <span class="accented">so</span> far as this was severed from himself, and perhaps with it to uproot at the same time a fundamental part of the Jewish religion.

This is a paraphrase, with a paraphrastic addition from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a> (7:7), in order to distinctly identify the ruler with Messiah. Nothing is commoner in Jewish authors than the silent conjunction of quotations from separate contexts. In this case the thought of the shepherd in <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> made the addition from Samuel the more easy. It must also be noticed that the reference of the passage in Micah to Christ is fully borne out by Jewish writers. Though they generally explain the rest of the verse as referring to the long lapse of time from David himself, they understand the ruler to be Messiah. But it is not usual with Jewish interpreters to understand the reference to Bethlehem as implying the place of Messiah's own birth. They generally take it as referring to the home of David, Messiah's ancestor. And this is the more natural meaning of the prophecy. The quotation, however, from the Jerusalem Talmud already given on ver. 1, and the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="../../par/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a> ("the tower of Edar - the place whence King Messiah is about to be revealed in the end of the days"), endorse the thoroughly Jewish character of the reply given to Herod (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). If it be asked why St. Matthew does not give an exact and verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the answer may be made that he probably gives the current form of its exposition. The high priests and scribes would have doubtless quoted it accurately <span class="accented">in the process</span> of weighing Micah's statement, but when, as here, they were only reproducing the result that they had arrived at, they would care for only the substance of the prophet's teaching (cf. the paraphrastic rendering of the Targum). <span class="accented">In the land of Judah</span>; Revised Version omits <span class="accented">in</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>). "Bethlehem-Judah" would have presented no difficulty, for a town was often distinguished by the apposition of the name of the district in which it was situated; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ramoth-Gilead, Kedesh-Naphtali. It seems best to explain the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> as a mere expansion of "Judah" (cf. 1 Macc. 5:68, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where probably the thought was Ashdod-Philistia). It is, however, possible that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used in the sense of "the town and its surrounding district, over which district, it is to be observed, Herod extended his massacre (verse 16)" (Humphrey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

Secrecy was doubly necessary. He would not publicly commit himself to acknowledging the rights of the new King, and he would give no opportunity for others to warn the Child's parents of the dangerous interest that Herod was taking in him. Duplicity was very characteristic of Herod; cf. his assassination of Aristobulus the high priest (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:03. 3), and his alluring his son Antipater home to death (ibid., 17:5. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Inquired of them diligently</span>; <span class="accented">learned of them carefully</span> (Revised Version); "lerned of hem bisili" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The stress is not upon Herod's careful questioning, but on the exact information that he obtained. <span class="cmt_word">What time the star appeared</span>.

Herod supposed that the birth of the Babe was synchronous with the first appearance of the star. The translation, however, of the Revised Version margin, "the time of the star that appeared," better suits the exact wording ( <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>;<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the phrase thus including both the first appearance and also the period of continuance (cf. Grotius, "non initium, sed continuitas"). But it is difficult to see What Herod would have learned from this latter particular. Some even think that the star was still visible (Plumptre; Weiss, 'Matthew'), but in this case the joy of the Magi in ver. 10 is not satisfactorily explained.

The fundamental thought is that the experience of Messiah was parallel to the experience of the nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The application of the term "my Son" to Messiah is justified by Jewish thought. In <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> the nation was so called; in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> the head of the nation, the theocratic king, received the same title; much more could the great theocratic King, the Messiah, be so spoken cf. That, indeed, the name, "the Son of God," was used as a title of Messiahship by the Jews lacks direct evidence (cf. Stanton, 'The Jewish and the Christian Messiah,' 1886, p. 288), but is surely to be deduced from <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a> (16:16); cf. also the application of <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> to Messiah in Talm. Bab.,' Succah,' 52 a, in the late Midrash 'Tillim,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, which traces" the decree" there spoken of through the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), the prophets (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>. <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>), and the Hagiographa (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; for a paraphrase, cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., App. 9.). It is hardly too much to say that no Jew could consistently, either in the early days of the Church or now, find any difficulty in St. Matthew's reference of the term "my Son" to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Seeing that St. Matthew's reference of the term "my Son" is justified by Jewish thought, and that the passage in Hosea is adduced to show that the experience of Messiah was parallel to that of the nation, there seems no real need to look for further reasons for the application. St. Matthew may hays held that Messiah was the Flower of Israel, so that what was predicated of Israel could be essentially explained of Messiah; he may have considered that Messiah was so organically connected with Israel that even when the nation was in Egypt Messiah was there also (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-10.htm">Hebrews 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); he may have thought that the pro-incarnate Son of God was always with his Church, and therefore with it even in Egypt; but of none of these theories have we any hint. The application of <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> to the early life of Christ belongs, we do not doubt, to the very earliest stage of Jewish Christian thought, and to defend it by modern subtleties of interpretation (sound though they may be in other connexions) seems quite out of place. Messiah was in some sense, as all Jews granted, the Son of God; Messiah, like the nation, went down into Egypt; what was predicated of the one was, clearly in this case, true of the other, and the prophet's words received a "fulfilment." The fulfilment was, indeed, what we should call a coincidence (cf. ver. 23, note), but to the pious mind, and especially to the pious mind of a Jew, coincidences are not chances, they are signs of the Divine Governor (cf. Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 481: 1889).

Although Macrobius is a late writer [circ. 400]. and made the mistake of supposing that Herod's son Antipater, who was put to death about the same time as the massacre of the innocents, had actually perished in that massacre, it is clear that the form in which he narrates the <span class="accented">bon</span> <span class="accented">mot</span> of Augustus points to some dim reminiscence of this cruel slaughter" (Farrar, 'Life,' etc., p. 34, illust. edit.; cf. also Ellicott, 'Lectures,' p. 78).

St. Matthew applies Jeremiah's picture of Rachel, the mother of Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Ephraim (and also Manasseh), which was the typical part of the northern kingdom, weeping over the destruction of her children by the Assyrians, to the weeping of the mothers in Bethlehem. This application was the more easy because, as Rachel's tomb was near Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.7), she might be considered the figurative ancestress of the Bethlehe-mites as well as the physical ancestress of the Ephraimites. The fulfilment spoken of is thus not to be understood as implying that Jeremiah predicted the massacre at Bethlehem, but that in it his words received a new and deeper significance. It must, however, be added that, although Rachel's tomb is placed at Bethlehem, both by the direct statement of the present text of Genesis and by tradition, which may be traced at least as far back as A.D. , and is accepted by Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, there are serious doubts whether <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> does not definitely place it in the north of Benjamin, and whether <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> does not accept this latter view (cf. for this question Delitzsch, on Genesis, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) .

But after Antipater's death Herod altered his will; and appointing Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, and Philip Tetrarch of Gaulonitis, Traehonitis, and Paneas, he granted the kingdom to Archelaus. Further, even after Herod's death, the succession was far from certain until the consent of Augustus had been obtained, and this, in fact, was jeopardized by Archelaus's massacre of three thousand cf those who, on his accession, called for justice on the agents of the barbarities of the late reign. Eventually, however, Herod's last arrangement was practically confirmed by Augustus, save that he expressly gave Archelaus, who had hastened to Rome, but half of his father's dominion, and appointed him only ethnarch, promising to make him king "if he governed that part virtuously" (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:08. 1; 11. 4; cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:33. 8; 2:7. 3).  Joseph's fear of Archelaus quite corresponds to the character given of him by the Jewish ambassadors before Augustus.

It does not now concern us to inquire which, if any, of the twelve disciples is here spoken of by the name of Netzer. But it is evident that  the Jews <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> connected this name closely with Jesus the Nazarene just before mentioned, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> saw a connexion between it and "the Branch" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>.

The application which was made, even according to the Talmud, is fully expressed by the evangelist here. There, as we may see if we read between the lines, the disciple claimed for his Christianity that it corresponded to the promise of Isaiah; here the evangelist more definitely claims a correspondence between that promise and Jesus. He is not concerned with deeper points of similarity, though they could not fail to suggest themselves both to him and to his readers, but merely notices that the very dwelling-place of Jesus answers to the promise of Messiah. <span class="accented">Netzer</span> he was to be; the Divine working brought it about that this, though in adjectival form, was his common appellation. Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to <span class="accented">netzer</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a> the word <span class="accented">tsemah</span>, corresponds in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fulfilment consists, not in carrying out a definite statement to its logical issue in history, but in the existence of a strange correspondence which implies Divine foresight and arrangement. Why Joseph settled at Nazareth rather than at any other spot in Galilee, St. Matthew gives no hint. The reason is found in the fact recorded by St. Luke that Mary (<a href="../../par/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>) and Joseph (<a href="../../par/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>) had lived there before the Birth. It is true that St. Matthew's account taken alone gives the impression that this was not the case, but the impression is not so strong as to warrant even the assertion that St. Matthew was ignorant of the earlier residence, much less that his account in fact contradicts St. Luke's. The mutual independence and the general trustworthiness of the two accounts of the Birth and Infancy is shown by the fact that in their less important details they cannot always be reconciled.

Their custom of name-giving was, and still largely is, as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> A Hebrew name is given to the child at circumcision. This is the holy name, and is used at all strictly religious ceremonies; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when called to read the Law in the synagogue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Each person has a name whereby he is known among the Gentiles. This is, at the present time, the name used for business and social purposes, and may be either Hebrew or of some ether language. It is usually connected, either in sound or meaning, with the holy name. So Paul and Saul, Didymus and Thomas (for numerous examples, cf. Hamburger, 'Real-Encycl.,' vol. 2. pp. 831-836. Lowe, 'Memorbook of Nurnberg,' pp. 18-28: 1881). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> He may have, either as well as or instead of the last, a name which designates him more exactly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) by mentioning his father or some other relation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bartimaeus, Barsabbas (probably); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) by mentioning some physical, mental, moral, or other peculiarity; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the Little, Simon the Zealot, Barnabas (the son of exhortation), and, from non-biblical authors, James the Just, Rabbi Judah the Holy, Samuel the Astronomer, John the Shoemaker. The title "the Baptist" belongs, of course, to this last class, and must have been given him partly because of the number of persons whom he baptized, and still more because baptism was the visible and external aim and result of his preaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was there new in John's baptism? In considering this it must be remembered that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> dipping in water had been commanded in the Law as a religious rite to priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) on their first consecration to their office, and on each occasion that they fulfilled the holiest parts of their duties (cf. the sprinklings of the Levites on their consecration, <a href="../../par/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-22</a>); and to all Israelites in cases of ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> It was very frequent among the Essenes (cf. especially the quotations from Josephus in Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians,' p. 171, edit. 1875). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> It was, we can hardly doubt, already customary at the admission of proselytes. There are, indeed, no certain allusions in Josephus, Philo, and the older Targumists (cf. Leyrer, in Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>) to the baptism of proselytes properly so called; but (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) it is distinctly mentioned in the Mishna, and in such a way as to imply that it was an ancient custom, for the schools of both Shammai and Hillel assume it as a matter of course ('Pes,' 8:8); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) as with books, so with customs, acceptance in two bodies originally one, as the Jewish and Christian Churches were, throws back the book or custom before the date of the separation. In other words, it is most improbable that Jews would only have begun to practise baptism at the admission of proselytes after it had been practised by a body which had separated from them. Jews would not be likely to adopt the distinguishing rite of Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Thus already, before John's time, baptism was largely practised as a symbol of purification from sin and of entrance on a new and holier life. Wherein, then, lay the distinguishing feature of John's baptism? Apparently in its being extended to all Israelites, without their having any personal ceremonial hindrance, and more particularly in the special aim and purpose to which it now referred. <span class="accented">It signified the entrance upon a new life of expectation of Messiah.</span> As of old, the nation had accepted the offer of God's kingdom, and, having washed their garments (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10, 14</a>), had been sprinkled with blood (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>), so now, when this kingdom, was about to be more fully manifested, not the nation, indeed, considered as a whole, but (in harmony with the individualization of the gospel) those persons who responded to the invitation, came forward and publicly renounced their sins and professed their expectation of the kingdom (Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:274). It is thus easy to account for the deep and widespread impression made by John the Baptist  (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3</a>), and for the important position that he holds in summaries of the origins of Christianity. John's baptism was treated by our Lord himself as the first stage in his earthly ministry, which culminated in the gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>), and naturally by the apostles as the historical introduction to the teaching and work of Messiah. Josephus's account of John the Baptist is well known, but too interesting to be omitted. "Now, some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army [by Aretas] came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John that was called the Baptist. For Herod had had him put to death, though he was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue both as to righteousness towards one another and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for baptism would be acceptable to God, if they made use of it, not in order to expiate some sins, but for the purification of the body, provided that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now, as many flocked to him, for they were greatly moved by hearing his words, Herod, fearing that the great influence John had over the people might lead to some rebellion (for the people seemed ready to do anything he should advise), thought it far best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties by sparing a man who might make him repent of his leniency when it should he too late. Accordingly, he was sent a prisoner, in consequence of Herod's suspicious temper, to Machaerus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. So the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and was a mark of God's displeasure against him" ('Ant,' 18:5. 2, Shilleto's Whiston). Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus confirms the Gospel account of the extent of John's influence over his countrymen; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> attributes his imprisonment and death to a political, not a moral, cause. It is quite possible, on the one hand, that political reasons were not altogether wanting; and, on the other, that Josephus was ignorant of the more personal and stronger motive of Herod's action. <span class="cmt_word">Preaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).

In contrast to the esoteric methods alike of heathen philosophers and of Jewish teachers, whether Pharisees, Sadducees, or Essenes.

By this term is not necessarily meant absolute desert, but "des lieux pen habites ou non cultives" (Neubauer, 'Geogr. du Talm.,' p. 52: 1868).

The expectation of Messiah must lead to separation, but separation deeper than that of those who called themselves the "separated" (Pharisees). <span class="cmt_word">Of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Judea</span>. The exact expression comes elsewhere only in the title of <a href="../../par/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, and in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, where it is defined as "in the south of Arad." It seems that, while different parts of the rugged district from Jericho southwards (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), immediately on the west and north of the Dead Sea, had their distinctive titles - the wilderness of Siph (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 15</a>), of Maon (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24</a>), of Engedi (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>), of Jeruel (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-16.htm">2 Chronicles 20:16</a>), of Tekoa (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) - the whole district was, as belonging to the tribe and even more certainly to the kingdom and province of Judah, known by the name of "the wilderness of Judaea." According to tradition, John was now preaching near Jericho. We find him soon after this at Bethany beyond Jordan (<a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>), and later still at tenon, near Salim, in, or on the borders of, Samaria (<a href="../../par/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>)."

The parallel passages give the substance of John's preaching - the baptism of repentance. St. Matthew takes, as it seems, a sentence that actually fell from his lips, and presents it as the kernel of his message ("preaching...  saying"). This is the more interesting as nowhere else are we told any words uttered by him in this the first stage of his ministry before crowds flocked to hear him. <span class="cmt_word">Repent ye...  at hand</span>; said word for word by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>, note). <span class="accented">Repent ye</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) . The word expresses the central thought of true repentance, in speaking, as it does, of a change of mind. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a>). As such it goes deeper than the Old Testament summons "Turn ye" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>), or the rabbinic <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>, for it points out in what part of man the alteration must be. (On <span class="accented">your</span> meaning more than the mere thinking power, and including also the willing faculty, cf. especially Delitzsch, 'Psych.,' p. 211, etc., Eng. trans., 1875.) It is noticeable that the LXX. never, as it seems, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but often <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> (of man only in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>; and <span class="accented">possibly</span> <a href="../../par/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>), which refers to repentance as a matter of feeling. As Messiah was coming, it was only natural that John should urge repentance. Similarly, we find late Jewish writers expounding <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, "'And the Spirit of God was moving [on the face of the waters].' This is the Spirit of King Messiah, like that which is said in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, 'And the Spirit  of the Lord shall rest upon him.' By what kind of merit does it draw near and come? It says, 'upon the face of the waters.' By the merit of repentance, which is compared to water, as it is written (Lain. 2:19), 'Pour out thy heart like water'" ('Bresh. R.,' &sect; 2). But, unfortunately, they assign far too legal a meaning to the word, and their phrase, "do repentance" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>), becomes almost identical with the "do penance" (<span class="accented">poeni-tentiam agite</span>, Vulgate) of the Roman Catholics (cf. Talm. Dab., 'Sanh.,' 97 b). <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom of heaven</span> (see Introduction, p. 22.).

In <a href="../../par/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> the following quotation is uttered by the Baptist himself, and some commentators have supposed this to be the case also here. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is against the parallel passages in Mark and Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of the expression in John arises directly from the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In the Baptist's mouth the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>) rather than the masculine would have been more natural. The expression is doubtless that of the evangelist, suggested to him by John's own utterance, the "is" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) expressing John's permanent character. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 4) of his clothing and food. [<span class="accented">He that was</span>] <span class="accented">spoken of.</span> The expression means, not a mere reference found in Isaiah, but the absolute content of the prophet's words.

The Hebrew probably joins "in the wilderness" with "prepare ye," but St. Matthew with "crying" (cf ver. 1, "preaching in the wilderness," as probably the LXX.) In Isaiah the original meaning of the passage was probably, "prepare for the return to Jerusalem." The figure is that of the common and necessary process in semi-civilized countries of repairing roads before a great personage comes along them.

Pliny's "mel silvestre." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Possibly "tree-honey" (so Weiss, 'Marc.,' p. 44; 'Life,' 1:308), a sweet vegetable juice obtained from dates (<span class="accented">vide</span> Josephus, <span class="accented">infra</span>) and grapes (as probably in Gem 43:11; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), and perhaps directly from wild trees, such as the manna ash and the tamarisk. So distinctly Suidas (A.D. 1100). "The forerunner ate locusts and wild honey, which is gathered together from the trees, and is commonly called manna." Diodorus Siculus ( <span class="date">B.C. 8</span>) seems to use the epithet "wild" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to distinguish this vegetable honey from that commonly in use (cf. Nicholson, 'Gosp. Hebrews,' p. 35). Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:08. 3) states that in the plain watered by the fountain of Jericho, "there are many sorts of palm trees watered by it, different from each other in taste and name; the better sort of them, when they are pressed, yield an excellent kind of honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), not much inferior to other honey. This country withal produces honey from bees (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)."

The marginal reading, however, proposed by the American Revisers "for baptism," does not do justice to the article. The Gospel according to the Hebrews (Resch, 'Agrapha.' p. 343) says that they were in fact baptized, but we can hardly suppose this to have been the case after John's words to them. Observe that the Pharisees, with their  self-conscious sanctity, were hardly likely to come to confess their sins, or the Sadducees to even listen to so ascetic a teacher. He said unto them; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the Pharisees and Sadducees; Luke, less exactly, "to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him." There is, indeed, nothing, save the opening sentence, which refers solely to the Pharisees and Sadducees; but this fact does not show (Bleek) that the words were really spoken to all, and that Matthew's expression is wrong. John doubtless addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees primarily; but as, after all, they only formed the apex of ordinary Jewish thought, what he said to them fitted also the majority of his listeners. <span class="cmt_word">O generation</span> (<span class="accented">ye offspring</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of vipers!</span> The simile not only expresses the thought that, behind their smooth exterior, the outward legal strictness of the Pharisees, and the worldly decorum of the Sadducees, lay hidden malice and venom, but also that this is due to their very nature. It may have directly implied that they belonged in a true sense to the seed of the serpent (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>); cf. our Lord's words (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath</span> (omitted by the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">warned you?</span> The verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) has elsewhere in the New Testament (St. Luke's writings only) no thought of warning, nor of secrecy, but of teaching, of placing the matter under the eyes of others (cf. especially <a href="../../par/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47</a>).

As it was recognized on all hands that the promise of blessing was made to Abraham and his seed, it is no wonder that many Jews presumed upon their descent from him, "sup, posing,", as Justin Martyr says ('Trypho,' &sect; 140.), that the everlasting kingdom will assuredly be given to those who are of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, although they be sinners and unbelieving and disobedient towards God." In later times, when the doctrine of merit was more fully established, God could be represented as saying to Abraham, "If thy children were like dead bodies without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail for them" ('Ber. Rabb.,' on Genesis 10:5:11. &sect; 44,  middle). In John's words, on the contrary, we have the germ of the doctrine afterwards Brought out by St. Paul (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9, 29</a>), that not natural descent, but spiritual relationship by faith, leads to inheriting the promises. The argument in <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, etc., is closely akin to that presented here. In both passages the Jews lay stress on their origin from Abraham; in both the answer is that morally they are sprung from a very different source (supra, ver. 7, note). But in <a href="../../par/john/8.htm">John 8</a>. the Jews are thinking chiefly of their present state, of not being as sinful as Jesus makes them out to be, while here they are thinking more of the future, that they have no need to take trouble, because promises for the future belong to them. Hence, perhaps, the exact expression (contrast <a href="../../par/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>), "We have Abraham as father," which brings out the protecting influence of Abraham as still available. <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>).

After our ver. 10 St. Luke inserts details of the various kinds of fruit that repentance ought to produce, suggested by the questions of different portions of the Baptist's audience; and then, with an explanatory note that John's words were due to a misconception having arisen that he was himself the Messiah, he adds what we have in vers. 11, 12. But even if vers. 0-12 were, in fact, not said consecutively, yet their juxtaposition here may be defended by the real connexion between the statements. In ver. 10 John has spoken of the present danger of his audience; he therefore now urges repentance, and that in view of the coming of One who will sift them to the uttermost. <span class="cmt_word">With water</span>; <span class="accented">in</span>, Revised Version margin (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), and so in the second part of the verse. The thought is not of the instrument by which the baptism is effected, but of the element in which it takes place. "In" suggests more complete submergence of the personality. <span class="cmt_word">But he that cometh after me</span>. The expression would recall the thought of" the Coming One" - a common designation of Messiah (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is mightier than I</span>.

The duty of slaves of the lowest rank. The distance of superiority here attributed by John to "him that cometh after me," must be reckoned even greater than it usually is; for most of the slaves then held by Jewish masters would not be Jews, but Gentiles. The thought is, "I am further removed from my successor than the meanest Gentile slave is from his Jewish master." Some have seen in this expression a reference to the practice of disciples carrying the shoes of their teachers (Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:272), but this can hardly have been general so early. <span class="cmt_word">He</span>. The emphasis is made the more evident by the absence of any connecting particle. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptize you</span>. "The transference of the image of baptism to the impartment of the Holy Spirit was prepared by such passages as <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> (<a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>)" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>); comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>, where the symbol of cleansing by water and the gift of the Holy Spirit are closely connected. <span class="cmt_word">With the Holy Ghost, and with fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). To the visible John contrasts the invisible, to the symbol of water the reality of the Spirit; adding (here and in the parallel passage in Luke) to this, which forms the main point of the contrast (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>), the thought of <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, purification as by fire; and, by not placing it under the government of another preposition (which would have necessitated the conception of it as a distinct element) implying that it is only another aspect of one and the same baptism. It has been questioned, indeed, whether "fire" here refers to the purification of the godly who truly accept the baptism of the Spirit, or to the destruction of the wicked, as in vers. 10, 12. But the thought is one. The Divine presence will in fact, as is recognized by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>), be twofold in its working, according as it is yielded to or the reverse.

Not the whole circle of righteousness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), but every part of righteous ness, as each is presented to us (similarly, <a href="../../par/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>; cf. also <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in Ecclus. 44:10; Tobit 2:14, where, although Neubauer and Fuller explain it as "alms." this is improbable after the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and that not merely every part of the righteousness included under the Mosaic, Law (cf. Alford, "requirements of the Law' and especially Lowe. 'Pesach Fragm.,' p. 100: 1879), but of that wider righteousness of which that was itself only a part and a type. "Let me be baptized by thee now," our Lord says to John, "for it is fitting for us, in this spirit of submission, to fill up every part of righteousness." Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> thus pleads for the absolute submission of John and himself to every portion of righteousness as it may be proposed to them by God to perform; his words thus somewhat resembling those to St. Peter, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" (<a href="../../par/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>). Thy duty is to baptize, mine to be baptized. It has generally been thought that in this verse our Lord implies that his baptism was to constitute his own formal recognition and acceptance of his distinctly Messianic duties - an act which involved the complete leaving of his past life and the giving himself up to a new and public life (cf. Weiss, 'Life,' 1:322). But have we any evidence that our Lord came to the baptism with this self-consciousness? May he not very well have known that he was to be the Messiah, and yet not have known that his official life was to begin now? May  he not have come to the baptism merely as an individual, feeling the deepest interest in this consecration to the cause of the kingdom, notwithstanding the unique position in which he knew himself to stand with regard to that kingdom? But his voluntary consecration of himself for whatever he might be guided to, was the opportunity taken by the Father for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, which had as its immediate consequence the retirement into the wilderness and the decision there come to. May not, in other words, our Lord's descent into Jordan have been, not the first act of his public life, but the last act of his private life - the former then being the withdrawal into the wilderness, in order there to have uninterrupted communion with his Father, and to meet in his official character his great adversary (cf. especially Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:279, etc.)?

So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin, with Westcott and Herr, rightly omits "unto him." The words were inserted because it was thought that Jesus alone saw the manifestation, as indeed we should have supposed if we had had only the account of St. Mark, who reads, "he saw" before "the heavens being rent asunder" (but cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-34</a>). To our Lord and to the Baptist the appearance was as though the sky really opened (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of God</span>; recalling <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. "Messiah now enters on his public office, and for that receives, as true Man, the appropriate gifts. The Spirit by whom men are sub jectively united to God descends upon the Word made Flesh, by whom objectively God is revealed to men" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> (Revised Version). The comparison is hardly to the gentleness of the descent of a dove, but to a visible appearance in bodily form, as a dove (see parallel passage in Luke). Not, of course, that the Holy Spirit was thus at all incarnate, but that either the appearance of a dove was seen by John's eyes only (cf. especially Theodore of Mopsuestia, in Meyer), or, as is not unlikely (even though the suggestion belongs ultimately to Paulus), a dove really flew down and lighted on the Lord (Luke), and that this, to outsiders merely a curious incident (cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a>), was to our Lord and the Baptist a sign of spiritual blessing. <span class="cmt_word">A dove</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>); any member of the pigeon tribe; chosen because a symbol of deliverance (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8</a>), of purity (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>), of harmlessness (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), and of endearment (<a href="../../par/songs/6-9.htm">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>). There is no evidence (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:287) that the dove was <span class="accented">at this period</span> interpreted by Jews as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Targum on <a href="../../par/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> paraphrasing "the voice of the turtle-dove ' by "the voice of the Holy Spirit," dates in its present form from the eighth to the tenth century. The dove mentioned (though probably by interpolation) in the account of Polycarp's death, appears to be a symbol of the soul (cf. Bishop Lightfoot). Wichelhaus (as quoted by Kubel) says suggestively, "lamb and dove  - no kingdom in the world has these emblems on its escutcheon." <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; omit, with manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Lighting</span>; <span class="accented">coming</span> (Revised Version), because it is needless to translate a common Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by a rare English word. Observe that it refers to the Holy Spirit, not to the dove as such. <span class="cmt_word">Upon him</span> (so Luke and <a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; Mark more vaguely, "unto him"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo</span>; peculiar to St. Matthew - a reminiscence of Aramaic diction. <span class="cmt_word">A voice</span>. Similarly in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a> (Transfiguration, cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17, 18</a>); <a href="../../par/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a> (like thunder); [possibly <a href="../../par/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a>, Pentecost]; <a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a> (Paul's conversion); 10:13, 15 (Peter). Talmudic and rabbinic writings often mention the Bath-Qol as speaking from heaven. The character of the occasions on which the voice is heard in the New Testament on the one hand, and in the Jewish writings on the other, shows the complete difference in the moral aspect of the two voices. The latter is at best little more than a parody of the former. (For the meaning of the expression Bath-Qol <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Weber, p. 188; Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:285.) <span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span>; <span class="accented">out of the heavens</span> (Revised Version), pointing to the phrase in ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. Western authorities add, "unto him," mostly reading the following words in the second person (cf. Mark and Luke). <span class="cmt_word">This is my beloved Son</span>. Very similar if not identical words were spoken at the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), Matthew giving precisely the same, Mark and Luke only omitting "in whom I am well pleased," and Luke also reading "chosen" instead of "beloved." It would seem more natural to suppose that the words spoken on the two occasions were really slightly different, and that therefore Matthew is the less accurate. <span class="accented">My</span> .... <span class="accented">Son</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>). <span class="accented">My beloved Son.</span> The expression is probably based on <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, Matthew 12:18, note); but this does not necessitate the punctuation of the Revised Version margin, and Westcott and Herr margin: "My Son; my beloved  in whom," etc. (For the expression, comp. also <a href="../../par/mark/12-6.htm">Mark 12:6</a> (not in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>); <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In whom I am well pleased;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in whom I have delight</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>, Authorized Version). The tense (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) is equivalent to "my delight" fell on him, he became the object of my love" (Winer, 40:5, b, 2). The Spirit came, the Father bore witness. "Thus the Baptist receives through a revelation the certainty of the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus the reader learns that the Son of David, who through his birth (ch. 1.) and the fortunes of his childhood (ch. 2.) was certified as the Messiah, now also is announced to the last of the prophets as the Son of God, to whom Jehovah, in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, etc., had promised the Messianic dominion of the world" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-Evang.'). Yet not only so; the words probably revealed to the Lord Jesus himself more of his exact relationship to the Father than he had before as Man realized. Such an assurance of his true nature, and of the Father's delight in him, would be of essential service in strengthening him for his work (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). There are two other matters connected with our Lord's baptism recorded by tradition (cf. especially Resch, 'Agrapha,'pp. 346-367)-additional words spoken, and an additional sign given. The words spoken are found in "Western" authorities of <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee," evidently with a desire to emphasize the application of the second psalm. The additional sign is the light or fire. The simplest form of this is (Tatian's 'Diatessaron,' edit. Zahn), "A light rose upon the waters;" and in the Ebionite Gospel apud Epiph., "Immediately a great light shone round about the place;" more fully in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 88), "When Jesus had gone down into the water, fire was kindled in the Jordan;" also in a now lost 'Pred. Paul,' "When he was being baptized, fire was seen upon the water;" and in the Cod. Vercellensis of the Old Latin, "When he was being baptized, an immense light shone round from the water, so that all who had come thither were afraid." Although there is no intrinsic objection to this symbol having taken place, it is very improbable that in this case the evangelists would not have recorded it. The legend may have arisen from ver. 11, or, and more probably, from an endeavour to make the baptism parallel to the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>); cf. Ephraem, in Resch ('Agrapha,' p. 358), "John drew near and worshipped the Son, whose form an unwonted lustre surrounded." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/4.htm"><title>Matthew 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/3.htm" title="Matthew 3">&#9668;</a> Matthew 4 <a href="../matthew/5.htm" title="Matthew 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - THE TEMPTATION. (Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>; a summary in <a href="../../par/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12, 13</a>.) The Father's acceptance of the Lord's consecration of himself for the work of the kingdom does not exclude temptation, but rather necessitates it. Psychologically, the reaction from the ecstasy of joy in hearing the announcement of <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a> was certain; ethically, such testing as would accompany the reaction was desirable. Even the Baptist was, as it seems, not without a special temptation during this period (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; and Bishop Westcott's note). At the very commencement of his official life the Lord is led consciously to realize that he has entered on a path of complete trust (even as his brethren in the flesh, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>) for all personal needs, a path which required great calmness and common sense, and along which he must take his orders for final victory, not from worldly principles, but direct from God. In Luke the order of the second and third temptations is reversed. Against the supposition of Godet and Ellicott, that St. Luke is historically correct, the "Get thee hence  Satan!" (ver. 10) seems conclusive. At any rate, for St. Matthew's aim in this Gospel the temptation that he places third is the crucial one; the true King will not take an irregular method of acquiring sovereignty. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; temporal. Mark, "and straightway." Immediately after the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him. <span class="cmt_word">Was led up ... into the wilderness.</span> <span class="accented">Up</span> (Matthew only); from the Jordan valley into the higher country round (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), in this case into the desert (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). There is nothing told us by which we may identify the place, but as the scene of the temptation must have been near the scene of the baptism, namely, on the west side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note), it may be presumed that the temptation was on the west side also. The sharp limestone peak (Godet) known since the Crusades as Quarantana, "from the quarantain, or forty days of fasting" (Trench, Studies,' p. 6), may, perhaps, have been the actual spot. The only important objection to this is that directly after the temptation (as seems most probable) he comes to John in "Bethany beyond Jordan," <a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> (not necessarily to be identified with "Bethabara" of the Received Text; its locality is quite unknown). If he went east of Jordan after the temptation, he would still be on one of the great roads to Galilee (<a href="../../par/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52</a>, etc.). The conjecture that the fasting and temptation took place on Sinai is suggested by the analogy of Moses and Elijah, but by absolutely nothing in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">Led up of the Spirit into the wilderness;</span> Mark, "the Spirit driveth him forth;" Luke, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness" (with a leading that lasted throughout the temptation, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>...<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). He was no doubt himself inclined to go apart into the desert that he might meditate uninterruptedly upon the assurance just given, and the momentous issues involved in his baptism; but the Holy Spirit had also his own purposes with him. The Holy Spirit cannot, indeed, tempt, but he can and does lead us into circumstances where temptation is permitted, that we may thereby be proved and disciplined for future work. In Christ's case the temptation was an important part of that moral suffering by which he learned full obedience (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Notice that even if the expression in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>, "the Spirit of God descending," does not in itself go beyond the expressions of Jewish teachers who deny his Personality, it would be hard to find so personal an action as is implied by the words, "Jesus was led up of the Spirit," attributed to the Spirit in non-Christian writings. For <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10, 11, 14</a> is much less definite, and passages, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>  in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12-14</a>, interpret themselves by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. To St. Matthew himself the Personality of the Holy Ghost must, in the light of <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, have been an assured fact. <span class="cmt_word">To be tempted of the devil</span>. So Luke; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great calumniator, him whose characteristic is false accusation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> against men (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10-12</a>); against God (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>). Here chiefly in the latter aspect. Each of the three temptations, and they are typical of all temptations; is primarily a calumniation of God and his methods. Mark has "of Satan," a Hebrew word equivalent to "adversary," which the LXX. nearly always renders by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, (compare also <a href="../../par/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22, 32</a>). Probably by the time of the LXX. the idea of the evil spirit accusing as in a law-court, was more prominent than the earlier thought of him as an adversary. Spiritual resistance by the evil spirit to all good is a less-developed thought than his traducing God to man, and, after some success obtained, traducing man to God. Evil may resist good; it may also accuse both God and those made after the likeness of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had fasted...  he was afterwards an hungred</span>. He was so absorbed in prayer that it was only after his six weeks meditation that he felt the need of food. But though his humanity had been elevated and his spiritual sense quickened by this at the time almost unconscious fast, it left him physically prostrate and completely exposed to attack. "In certain morbid conditions, which involve a more or less entire abstinence from food, a period of six weeks generally brings about a crisis, after which the demand for nourishment is renewed with extreme urgency. The exhausted body becomes a prey to a deathly sinking. Such, doubtless, was the condition of Jesus; he felt himself dying. It was the moment the tempter had waited for to make his decisive assault" (Godet). Luke (cf. Mark?) probably (though not in the Revised Version) represents the temptation as continuous during the whole period. Of this Matthew says nothing, but only describes the final scenes, when the might of the tempter was felt to the uttermost, and his defeat was most crucial. <span class="cmt_word">Forty</span>. Trench's remark is well worth study: "On a close examination we note it to be everywhere there [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Holy Scripture] the number or signature of penalty, of affliction, of the confession, or the punishment, of sin (Studies, p. 14). <span class="cmt_word">Nights</span>.

The devil does not attempt to throw doubt on the truth of the utterance in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. His words rather mean, "Thou knowest what was said, thou bast been gradually realizing that assurance of Sonship; use, then, that privilege which thou undoubtedly hast" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>, where, in mockery, the same truth is assumed). Wetstein, following Origen and pseudo-Ignatius,' Philipp.,' &sect; 9, says that the tempter did not know, or at least doubted, whether Jesus was really God, for otherwise he would never have tempted him. This is, surely, to miss the meaning of the temptation for our Lord himself; for he was tempted as Man. Satan might well haw known that he was God incarnate, and yet not have known whether as Man he might not yield. Weiss ('Life,' 1:343) mistakenly thinks that the object of this first temptation was to insinuate doubt in the mind of Jesus as to his Messiahship. "Command that these stones become bread, and if thou canst not do so, then thou art not the Son of God." <span class="cmt_word">Command that</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (cf.

Farrar (on <a href="../../par/luke/4-3.htm">Luke 4:3</a>; and especially in 'Life of Christ,' illustrated edit., pp. 99, 100) suggests that there is a special reference to the "loaf-shaped fossils," <span class="accented">septaria</span>, which are found in Palestine - as, indeed, in most other countries. But though these "flattened nodules of calcareous clay, ironstone, or other matter" (Page, ' Handbook of Geolog. Terms,' etc., 1859, p. 327) often assume fantastic shapes, perhaps even distantly resembling either an English loaf or a fiat Jewish cake (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) , it seems quite unnecessary to see any allusion to them here.

In Luke the devil points to one stone only, and tempts him to bid it become a loaf.

Our Lord's three quotations are from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16, 13</a>. Some portion of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21, because included in the Sh'ma) was the first part of Scripture taught a Jewish child. Possibly, though there is no evidence upon the subject, the neighbouring portions were often added. If they had been in our Lord's case, such a recurrence of them to his mind in his present state of exhaustion is in complete accord with psychological probability. <span class="cmt_word">Man...  God</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, LXX.). As we could not accept Weiss's interpretation of the object of the devil's temptation, so neither can we accept his interpretation of our Lord's reply, that it is equivalent to "Not by means either natural or supernatural, is man's life really sustained, but by exact obedience to God's command." Our Lord quotes the passage in its primary meaning, which was fully applicable to the present occasion. It is equivalent to "Man lives, not necessarily by natural means, but by even supernatural means, if God so wishes." "The creative word, the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which alone imparts to the bread its sustaining power, can sustain, even as he is confident that in the present need it will sustain, apart from the bread" (Trench, 'Studies,' p. 35). The words of Deuteronomy are paraphrased in Wisd. 16:26, where the author, in a thoroughly Jewish exposition, enumerates the lessons taught by the giving of the manna. "It was altered...  that thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man; but that it is thy Word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee." <span class="cmt_word">By every word</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> (Textus Receptus; Westcott and Hort) is doubtless right. The alteration to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (Lath-mann, Tregelles) is probably due to a tendency towards the simple expression of <span class="accented">means</span>, but perhaps to the feeling that life, especially spiritual life, is maintained rather <span class="accented">in</span> a sphere than on a basis (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>).

From <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>, the end of which verse, "There shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean," heightens the implied contrast of the devil's presence there. (For the expression, cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11, 12</a>.)

The right reading (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in Luke) is probably a trace of the basis common to the two records. Possibly, however, it may here be a merely accidental similarity with Luke (who employs the aorist throughout the section), caused by Matthew's desire to emphasize the momentariness of the devil's act. Some think that, as at the end of the temptation Christ is in the wilderness, this removal to Jerusalem is solely mental, without any motion of his body. Improbable; for to make such a temptation <span class="accented">real</span>, our Lord's mind must have suffered complete illusion. He must have <span class="accented">thought</span> that he was "on the pinnacle." <span class="cmt_word">On</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">pinnacle</span> of the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) . What is exactly meant by this definite and evidently well-known term is not easy now to determine.

Of this last Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11. 5) makes special mention, saying, in his exaggerated style, that human sight could not reach from the top of it to the bottom of the ravine on whose edge it stood. Edersheim ('Life,' etc., 1:303) thinks that possibly the term means "the extreme corner of the 'wing-like' porch, or <span class="accented">ulam</span>, which led into the Sanctuary." This last would suit a possible interpretation of <a href="../../par/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, as referring to a part of the temple under the name of "the pinnacle," which had been used for heathen sacrifices, probably in the worship of the sun. Cf.

Luke omits only "in all thy ways." The clause, according to either record, was omitted possibly because the devil shrank from reminding Jesus of "ways" which he need not take; more probably because . ' ways" hardly fitted this case (cf. Weiss). Trench ('Studies,' p. 40), following St. Bernard, says that the omission of the clause alters the whole character of the quotation, considering that "ways" implies ways appointed by God. But this appears to be strained. The devil, appealing to Jesus' consciousness of abiding communion with God (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>), bids him enjoy to the full the promise of God's protection. There is no thought here of a "miracle of display" to the multitudes who were assembled, "as a matter of course," on the temple area (Meyer; cf. even Trench). Neither the devil's solicitation nor our Lord's reply hint at anything else than Divine protection. If it be urged that for this any one of the many precipices by the Dead Sea, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> those of the Quamntana (ver. 1, note) itself, would have been sufficient, the answer may be found in the fact that at the temple, the seat of God's special manifestation, God's special protection might be looked for.

In favour of the latter view is the fact that the recitative <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is not used elsewhere in this section (vers. 4, 7, 10), but as in <a href="../../par/luke/4-10.htm">Luke 4:10</a> it can hardly be other than recitative (for another <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is inserted before "on their hands"), the probability is that it was recitative in the oral source, and therefore recitative here. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">on</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

Judith's words to the people of Bethulia that, by fixing a limit of days for God to deliver them, they in reality tempted God [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>] Judith 8:12: cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>). "In this refusal of Christ's are implicitly condemned all who run before they are sent, who thrust themselves into perils to which they are not called; all who would fain be reformers, but whom God has not raised up and equipped for the work of reformation; and who therefore for the most part bring  themselves and their cause together to shame, dishonour, and defeat; with all those who presumptuously draw drafts on the faithfulness of God, which they have no scriptural warrant to justify them in believing that He will honour" (Trench, 'Studies,' p. 43).

While no material mountain would have enabled our Lord to see all the kingdoms, etc., with his bodily eyes, it is probable that the physical elevation and distance of landscape would psychologically help such a vision. The Quarantana, which "commands a noble prospect" (Soein's ' Baedeker,' p. 263), may have been the spot.

In Luke this expression does not occur at this point, but in the tempter's words. As it there comes more abruptly, that is perhaps the more original position. St. Luke adds, "In a moment of time."

The devil puts "these things" and "thee" in the sharpest contrast. In Luke the devil says, "To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the authority] hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there the devil speaks of giving, not actual possession of the things themselves (Matthew), but the authority that this implied, "and the glory of them." According to St. Luke, he does not attempt to conceal the fact that he has not absolute possession, but he claims authority as delegated to him, and as capable of being delegated by him to another. His claim was false as absolutely stated, but is true relatively in so far that even his usurpation of power must have been permitted (cf. our Lord's term for him, "The prince of this world"). <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt fall down and worship me;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prostrate thyself in obeisance before me - the Eastern method of acknowledging the superiority of a person (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a>). The expression does not mean "worship me as God" (for this surely was far too coarse a temptation to overcome any even ordinarily pious Israelite; cf. Weiss), but "acknowledge my rights as over-lord." It is not a question of apostasy (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), but of submission to the methods inculcated by Satan, which placed the immediate and the visible above the future and the unseen (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>).

This temptation calls out a passionate utterance of a personality stirred, because touched, in its depths. Only once again do we find our Lord so moved, in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a> (the "Western" and "Syrian" addition here of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> from that passage emphasizes the feeling common to the two cases), when a similar representation is made to him that he ought to escape the troubles which his Messianic position, in fact, brought upon him. <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>); from the LXX., which differs from the Hebrew by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span>, "fear," by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (but B has <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the paraphrastic insertion of "only." <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> <span class="accented">Worship</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>) , as in ver. 9.

Note). Our Lord's reply cuts up the devil's solicitation by the root. "I do not enter," he means, "into the question of thy authority over these things, and of thy power concerning them. I acknowledge thee not. The command which I willingly obey excludes all homage and service to any other over-lord than God alone. I accept not thy orders and thy methods. I take my commands direct from God." Observe that our Lord does not say <span class="accented">how</span> he is to gain the kingdoms for his own; this would be the care of him whose command he follows. But before ascending, the Lord proclaimed (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>) that he had received (i.e. gained through suffering, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>: <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) more than (note "in heaven") what the devil would have given him as a reward of obedience to false principles.

(Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14, 15</a>.) According to some commentators, a new section begins here; but probably these verses are still preliminary. Our Lord's activity does not begin till ver. 17.

If we had the synoptic Gospels alone, we should have supposed that the Baptist was imprisoned immediately after the end of our Lord's temptation (cf. this verse with <a href="../../par/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>); but St. John (<a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>) expressly states that he had not been cast into prison when the events recorded in <a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43-3:23</a> took place. "For a time Christ and the Baptist worked side by side, preaching ' repentance' (<a href="../../par/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> [also <a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>]) and baptizing [<a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>]. The Messiah took up the position of a prophet in Judaea, as afterwards in Galilee" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-24</a>). The events in Galilee related in <a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a> were "preparatory to the manifestation at Jerusalem which was the real commencement of Christ's Messianic work. St. John records the course and issue of this manifestation: the other Evangelists start with the record of the Galilaean ministry, which dates from the imprisonment of the Baptist" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). He adds, on <a href="../../par/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43</a>, "It seems probable that the earlier part of the synoptic narratives (<a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14 - 2:14</a>, and parallels) must be placed in the interval which extended from <a href="../../par/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43-5:1</a>." Matthew alone states directly that the news of the Baptist having been taken by Herod was the motive of our Lord's withdrawal into Galilee. He says nothing to show whether our Lord withdrew because he would avoid a like treatment himself, or, as is on the whole more likely, because he did not wish to be mixed up in the tumults to which John's capture appears to have given rise (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was cast into prison;</span> "was delivered up" (Revised Version and Authorized Version margin); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, absolutely (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>). If the more proper meaning of the word may be insisted on, the thought is of the person to whom John was committed rather than of the place; John being delivered up, that is to say, by Herod to his officials. But in usage it appears rather to mean only compulsory removal, loss of liberty. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>) points out the temporary protection that the imprisonment gave to John against the resentment of Herodias. <span class="cmt_word">He departed</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he withdrew</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,.

Into Galilee; whence he had come (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13</a>). Hence "returned" (Luke). In Galilee he would still be in Herod's dominions; but, as being in his own home, he would not attract so much attention. N.B. - Between vers. 12 and 13 some place the incident of his preaching at Nazareth (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>); but ver. 23 of that passage assumes much previous work at Capernaum, and can therefore hardly be as early as this.

The identification with <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> can, however, hardly be considered as absolutely settled. "Some of the narratives of pilgrims of the sixth and seventh centuries appear to place Capernaum here. Jewish authors mention a place called <span class="accented">Karat Tankhum</span>, or <span class="accented">Nakhum</span>; and as the Arabic <span class="accented">Tell</span> ("hill") might easily be substituted for the word Kaphar ("village"), and Nakhum corrupted to Hum, Capernaum and Tell-Hum may be identical. On the other  hand, Sepp supposes that the name of the <span class="accented">Minim</span> (Jewish Christians), who are known to have been numerous at Capernaum down to the time of Constantine, has been preserved in the Khan Minyeh" (Socin's ' Baedeker,' p. 373). <span class="cmt_word">Which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim.</span> The details are mentioned to show the accordance with the following prophecy. Neubauer ('Geogr. du Talm.,' p. 222, edit. 1868) points out that, according to <a href="../../par/joshua/19-33.htm">Joshua 19:33, 34</a>, and the notices in the Talmud, the whole western side of the lake was in Naphtali, and that hence Capernaum could not, strictly speaking, be "in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim." He himself explains the discrepancy by saying that St. Matthew imitates the Haggadistic methods in accommodating the geography to the text he quotes. But it is clear that the expression is satisfied by the fact that Zebulun was really near Capernaum, and that numbers of those who frequented the town must have come from Zebulun. The position of Capernaum thus formed quite a sufficient reason for quoting the prophecy in Isaiah. Our evangelist, who (ch. 2.) had noticed the coining of distant heathen to worship Messiah, though he was persecuted by the then ruler of the nation, found it very significant that his public activity should begin at a distance from the home of the hierarchy, and in a district which had been the first to suffer from heathen attacks in the past, and had at the present moment a population in which there was a great mixture of the heathen element (cf. Weiss, 'Matthiaus-Evang.').

Wetstein gives a tradition from the 'Pesikt.

The close union of this clause in the Authorized Version with the following words, "beyond Jordan," misses its true meaning as explanatory of the position of Zebulun and Naphtali, and rather takes it as describing some special locality east of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eastern side, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> as having suffered with Naphtali under the Assyrian invasion; see further ver. 25.

Probably Zebedee and his wife Salome became, unlike Peter's parents, well-known believers.

"The synagogues were places of assembly for public worship, where on sabbaths and feast-days (at a later period, also on the second and fifth days of the week) the people met together for prayer, and to listen to the reading of portions of the Old Testament, which were translated and explained in the vernacular dialect.

There is little doubt that the two accounts (here and <a href="../../par/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a>.) represent one and the same discourse, the main arguments for this belief being thus given by Ellicott ('Hist. Lects.,' p. 179): "That the beginning and end of the Sermon are nearly identical in both Gospels; that the precepts, as recited by St. Luke, are in the same general order as those in St. Matthew, and that they are often expressed in nearly the same words; and lastly, that each Evangelist specifies the same miracle, viz. the healing of the centurion's servant, as having taken place shortly after the Sermon, on our Lord's entry into Capernaum." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-16.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">The ideal character of his disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">beati</span>; hence "Beatitudes."

It describes them in reference to their inherent state, not to the gifts or the rewards that they receive.

Poverty of spirit stands in contrast to self sufficiency (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>) and as such is perhaps the quality which is most of all opposed to the Jewish temper in all ages (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>).

As recently in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18, 19</a>), so also here, he bases the explanation of his work on the prophecy of that work in the Book of Isaiah.

Hence Tertullian ('Adv.

Hatch even infers - on, we think, very insufficient premisses  -  that these two words, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>), designate the poor of an oppressed country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peasantry, the <span class="accented">fellahin</span> of Palestine as a class, and he considers it probable that this special meaning underlies the use of the words in these verses. Whether this be the case or not, the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> completely excludes the supposition that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> meant to refer to any merely external circumstances. <span class="accented">In spirit</span>; Matthew only (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>).

Christ here affirms the blessedness of those who are in their spirit absolutely devoid of wealth. It cannot mean that they are this in God's opinion, for in God's opinion all are so. It means, therefore, that they are this in their own opinion. While many feel in themselves a wealth of soul-satisfaction, these do not, but realize their insufficiency. Christ says that they realize this "in (their) spirit;" for the spirit is that part of us which specially craves for satisfaction, and which is the means by which we lay hold of true satisfaction. The actual craving for spiritual wealth is not mentioned in this verse. It is implied, but direct mention of it comes partly in ver. 4, and especially in ver. 6. <span class="accented">For theirs.</span> Emphatic, as in all the Beatitudes (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>,). <span class="accented">Is.</span> Not hereafter (Meyer), but even already. <span class="accented">The kingdom of heaven</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> note, p. 150). The poor in spirit already belong to and have a share in that realm of God which now is realized chiefly in relation to our spirit, but ultimately will be realized in relation to every element of our nature, and to all other persons, and to every part, animate and inanimate, of the whole world.

Meyer, Weiss), and also those of ver. 4 fitted excellently with ver. 6. But far the greater balance of evidence is in favour of the usual order, which also, though not on the surface, is in the deepest connexion with the preceding and the following verses. They that mourn (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>). Our Lord does not define that which causes the mourning, but as the preceding and the following verses all refer to the religious or at least the ethical sphere, merely carnal and worldly mourning is excluded. The mourning referred to must, therefore, be produced by religious or moral causes. Mourners for the state of Israel, so far as they mourned not for its political but for its spiritual condition (cf. similar mourning in the Christian Church, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9, 10</a>), would be included (cf. Weiss, 'Life,' 2:142); but our Lord's primary thought must have been of mourning over one's personal state, not exactly, perhaps, over one's sins, but over the realized poverty in spirit just spoken of (cf. Weiss-Meyer). As the deepest poverty lies in the sphere of the spirit, so the deepest mourning lies there also. All other mourning is but partial and slight compared with this (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-14.htm">Proverbs 18:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they shall be comforted</span>. When?

The mourning over one's personal poverty in spirit is removed in proportion as Christ is received and appropriated; but during this life such appropriation can be only partial.

It occurs also in <a href="../../par/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9, 11, 22, 29, 34</a>; and since in the eleventh verse of the psalm it is directly said of the meek: "But the meek shall inherit the land (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>)," it is, doubtless, from this latter passage that our Lord borrows the phrase. The meaning attributed by our Lord to the word <span class="accented">meek</span> is not clear. The ordinary use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in the New Testament refers solely to the relation of men to men, and this is the sense in which <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is taken by most commentators here. But with this sense, taken barely and solely, there seems to be no satisfactory explanation of the position of the Beatitude. Vers. 3 and 4 refer to men in their relation to God; ver. 6, to say the least, includes the relation of men to God; what has ver. 5 to do here if it refers solely to the relation of men to men? It would have come very naturally either before or after ver. 9 ("the peacemakers"); but why here? The reason, however, for the position of the Beatitude lies in the true conception of meekness. While the thought is here primarily that of meekness exhibited towards men (as is evident from the implied contrast <span class="accented">in they shall inherit the earth</span>), yet meekness towards men is closely connected with, and is the result of, meekness towards God. This is not exactly humility (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which, as regards God, is equivalent to a sense of creatureliness or dependence; cf. Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 42.). Meekness is rather the attitude of the soul towards another when that other is in a state of activity towards it. It is the attitude of the disciple to the teacher when teaching; of the son to the father when exercising his paternal authority; of the servant to the master when giving him orders. It is therefore essentially as applicable to the relation of man to God as to that of man to man. It is for this reason that we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>very frequently used of man's relation to God, in fact, more often than of man's relation to man; and this common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span> must be specially remembered here, where the phrase is taken directly from the Old Testament. Weiss ('Matthaus-ev.') objects to Tholuck adducing the evidence of the Hebrew words, on the ground that the Greek terms are used solely of the relation to man, and that this usage is kept to throughout the New Testament. But the latter statement is hardly true. For, not to mention <a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, in which the reference is doubtful, <a href="../../par/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a> certainly refers to the meekness shown towards God in receiving his word. "The Scriptural <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>," says Trench, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>," is not in a man's outward behaviour only; nor yet in his relations to his fellow-men; as little in his mere natural disposition. Rather is it an inwrought grace of the soul; and the exercises of it are first and chiefly towards God (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>). It is that temper of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting; and it is closely linked with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, and follows directly upon it (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>), because it is only the humble heart which is also the meek; and which, as such, does not fight against God, and more or less struggle and contend with him." Yet, as this meekness must be felt towards God not only in his <span class="accented">direct</span> dealings with the soul, but also in his <span class="accented">indirect</span> dealings (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by secondary means and agents), it must also be exhibited towards men. Meekness towards God necessarily issues in meekness towards men. Our Lord's concise teaching seizes, therefore, on this furthest expression of meekness. Thus it is not meekness in the relation of man to man barely staled, of which Christ here speaks, but meekness in the relation of man to man, with its prior and presupposed fact of meekness in the relation of man to God. <span class="cmt_word">Shall inherit the earth.</span> In the Psalm this is equivalent to the land of Palestine, and the psalmist means that, though the wicked may have temporary power, yet God's true servants shall really and finally have dominion in the land. But what is intended here? Probably our Lord's audience understood the phrase on his lips as a Messianic adaptation of the original meaning, and as therefore implying that those who manifested a meek reception of his will would obtain that full possession of the land of Palestine which was now denied to the Israelites through the conquest of the Romans. But to our Lord, and to the evangelist who, years after, recorded them, the meaning of the words must have been much fuller, corresponding, in fact, to the true meaning of the "kingdom of heaven," viz. that the meek <span class="accented">shall inherit</span> - shall receive, as their rightful possession from their Father, the whole earth; renewed, it may be (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), but still the earth (<a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>), with all the powers of nature therein implied. Of this the conquest of nature already gained through the civilization produced under Christianity is at once the promise and, though but in a small degree, the firstfruits.

Yet the thought here is not  the actual participation, but the craving. The Benediction marks a distinct stage in our Lord's argument.

As in the case of vers. 3, 4, now in part, fully hereafter. "St. Austin, wondering at the overflowing measure of God's Spirit in the Apostles' hearts, observes that the reason why they were so full of God was because they were so empty of his creatures.

The mercy referred to here is not so much the almost negative quality which the word usually suggests to us (not dealing harshly, not inflicting punishment when due, sparing an animal or a fellow-man some unnecessary labour), as active kindness to the destitute and to any who are in trouble (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-15.htm">Matthew 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>).

To this statement of our Lord's, that they who show mercy to those in need shall themselves be the objects of mercy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from God) in their time of need, many parallels have been adduced, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Wetstein. Rabbi Gamaliel (? the second, circa A.D. ), as reported by Rabbi Judah (circa A.D. ), says (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 151 <span class="accented">b</span>), on <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-18.htm">Deuteronomy 13:18</a>, "Every one that showeth mercy to others, they show mercy to him from heaven, and every one that showeth not mercy to others, they show him not mercy from heaven;" cf. also ' Test.

(For the converse, cf. <a href="../../par/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>.) Calvin remarks, "Hoc etiam paradoxon cum humano judicio pugnat.

St. Peter also says, perhaps with a reference to our Lord's words, that they who suffer <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> are <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For theirs is the kingdom of heaven</span>. The same promise that was given to "the poor in spirit" (ver. 3) is here given to the persecuted for righteousness' sake. In the former case, poverty in the sphere of the spirit obtains the fullest possessions; here the same promise is given to temporal loss produced by faithfulness to the cause of righteousness. In ver. 3 our Lord removed all occasion for intellectual and spiritual pride. Here he comforts for temporal and social losses (cf. especially <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; further see ver. 3, note). Clement of Alexandria, '<span class="accented">Strom.</span>,' 4:6 (p. 582, Potter) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> confuses this and the preceding Beatitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> gives a curious reading of some who alter the Gospels: "Blessed are they who have been persecuted through righteousness (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), for they shall be perfect; and blessed are they who have been persecuted for my sake, for they shall have a place where they shall not be persecuted" (cf.

This is possible, but external evidence exists only in the case of vers. 13 and 15 (for vers. 14 and 16 are peculiar to Matthew); and even in the case of these verses it is by no means clear (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) that the occasions on which, according to the other Gospels, the sayings were uttered are the more original. Weiss's assertion  ('Life,' 2:144), "The remarks in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13-16</a>, bearing on the calling of discipleship,.., cannot belong to the sermon on the mount, carefully as they are there introduced, for the prophesied sufferings of his followers might have made them disloyal," is wholly gratuitous. In fact, the sufferings have been much more strongly spoken of in vers. 11, 12. The disciples are now addressed directly, and are urged to "walk worthily of the vocation wherewith they are called." The mention of those who have endured persecution leads our Lord to warn his disciples not to faint under persecution in any of its forms; they are but entering on the succession of the prophets; their work is that of purifying and preserving and of illuminating; they must therefore allow their character as disciples to appear, as appear it must if they arc true to their position. There is a purpose in this, namely, that men may see their actions, and glorify their Father which is in heaven. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22, 23</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - As ver. 10 spoke of the blessedness of those who had suffered persecution and had endured it, so this verse speaks of the blessedness of those who are suffering from it at the moment, whether it be in act or word.

The doctrine of recompense, which has so large a place in Jewish thought (for a not often-sire example, cf. 'Ab.,' 2:19, Taylor) comes also in Christ's teaching. In <a href="../../par/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a> reward is expressly divested of its merely legal side, and exhibited as ultimately dependent on the will of the great Householder. But here it is mentioned without reference to the difficulties involved in the conception. These difficulties centre round the thought of obligation from God to man. But it may be doubted whether these difficulties are not caused by too exclusively regarding the metaphor of contracting, instead of considering the fact indicated by the metaphor. In God's kingdom every action has a corresponding effect, and this effect is the more certain in proportion as the action is in the sphere of morality. The idea of "quantity" hardly enters into the relation of such cause and effect. It is a question of moral correspondence. But such effect may not unfitly be called by the metaphors "hire," "reward," because, on the one hand, it is the result of conditions of moral service, and, on the other, such terms imply a Personal Will at the back of the effect, as well as a will on the part of the human "servant." (For the subject in other connexions, cf. Weiss, 'Bibl. Theol.,' &sect; 32; cf. also ver. 46; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2, 4, 5, 6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In heaven</span>.

Weiss thinks that St. Luke gives it in its original context; that St. Matthew is right in interpreting it as of special reference to the disciples; and that St. Mark applies it the most freely. It may, indeed, be that its position here is only the result of the inspired guidance of the evangelist; but, on the whole, it seems more probable that so natural a figure was used more than once by our Lord, and that he really spoke these words in his sermon on the mount, as well as on the later occasion indicated by St. Luke. <span class="accented">Ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of ver. 1. <span class="accented">Are</span>, in fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>); therefore recognize the responsibility. <span class="accented">The salt of the earth.</span> It has been disputed whether allusion is here made to the preservative properties of salt or to the flavour it imparts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether Christ is thinking of his disciples as preserving the world from decay, or as giving it a good flavour to the Divine taste. Surely a useless question; forgetful of the fact that spiritual realities are being dealt with, and that it is therefore impossible for the one effect to be really separated from the other. Our Lord is thinking of the moral tone which his disciples are to give to humanity. The connexion with vers. 11, 12 is - Persecution must be borne unless you are to lose your moral tone, which is to be to the earth what salt is to its surroundings, preserving from corruption and fitting for (in your case Divine) appreciation. What <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is to be to the Christian <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>), that the Christian himself is to be to the world. <span class="cmt_word">If...  have lost its savour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>); so elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a> only. Salt that has lost its distinctive qualities is here said to lack its proper mind or sense. Salt without sharpness is like an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; for man is a <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. On the fact of salt losing its virtue, cf. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 382: 1887), "It is a well-known fact that the salt <span class="accented">of this country</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Palestine] when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered [<span class="accented">vide infra</span>], much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all; and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust  - not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown....  No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street; and there it is cast, to be trodden under foot of men." It should be observed that the salt used in Palestine is not manufactured by boiling clean salt water, nor quarried from mines, but is obtained from marshes along the seashore, as in Cyprus, or from salt lakes in the interior, which dry up in summer, as the one in the desert north of Palmyra, and the great Lake of Jebbul, south-east of Aleppo. Further, rock-salt is found in abundance at the south end of the Dead Sea (cf. Thomson, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not if you will not act as salt, wherewith shall the earth be salted? (apparently Luther and Erasmus); but what quality can take the place of moral tone to produce in you the same result? You are as salt. If you lose your distinctive qualities, where, can you find that which answers to them? <span class="cmt_word">It is thenceforth good for nothing.</span> Our Lord here lays stress, not on want of fitness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), but on want of inherent power. "It is only useful for that purpose to which one applies what is absolutely useless" (Weiss-Meyer). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the light of the world</span>. After speaking of the moral tone that the disciples were to give to the world, in contrast to sin in its corrupting power, Christ refers to them as enlightening, in contrast to sin as darkness and ignorance. Our Lord further naturally exchanges the term "the earth" (which from its strong materialism had suited the figure of the salt) for "the world" - a phrase which must, indeed, as regards the disciples, be limited to this earth, but as regards the light, need not be limited to less than the solar system. In other words, the simple reason why he exchanges "earth" for "world" is that they are respectively the best suited to the figure employed. Notice that Christ never applies the former figure, of salt, to himself; but the latter, of light, once or twice, especially <a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where, since he is speaking of himself, and not of others, he adds the thought of life being connected with light, <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">city</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">a city cannot be hid when set on a mountain.</span> It seems at first slightly  awkward to introduce the figure of a city between those of the sun and the lamp, both these having to do with light. The reason is that the city is not considered as such, but only as an object which can be teen, and which cannot (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, emphatic) from its physical conditions avoid being seen. There is a true gradation in the thought of influence. The sun must be seen by all; the city, by the whole neighbourhood; the lamp, by the family. Our Lord comes from the general to the particular; from what is almost theory, at best a matter of hope and faith, to hard fact and practice. The influence you are to have - if it is to be for the whole world, as indeed it is, must be felt in the neighbourhood in which you live, and <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">fortiori</span> in the immediate circle of your own home. Conjectures have been made whether any one city can reasonably be mentioned as being in sight, and so having suggested this image to our Lord. If the exact spot where he was then sitting were itself certain, such conjectures might be worth considering. But, in fact, so many "cities" in Palestine were set on hills that the inquiry seems vain. <span class="accented">Safed</span>, some twelve miles north-west of Capernaum, the view from which extends to Tiberias (Neubaur, 'Geogr.,' p. 228), has been accepted by many, but evidence is lacking for it having been a city at that time. Tabor, at the south-west of the lake, has also been thought of, and at all events seems to have been then a fortified town. The view from it is even more extensive than from <span class="accented">Safed</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Socin's Baedeker, p. 365).

"chandelier") meant a stand for either candles or lamps; hence Wickliffe, translating from the Vulgate, could say, "Ne me[n] teen-dith not a lanterne & puttith it vndir a buyschel: but on a candilstik." We still use "candlestick" in the rarer sense when we speak of the seven-branched "candlestick" of the tabernacle, which was lighted by lamps, not candies (cf. Humphry, on Revised Version, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It giveth Light</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">it shineth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The Rheims alone of the older English versions renders" shine," thus showing that the same Greek word is used as in the next verse. The Vulgate (followed by Wickliffe and Rheims) renders it in the subjunctive, <span class="accented">ut lucent</span>, possibly originally a copyist's error from the <span class="accented">luceat</span> of ver. 16. If so, it was apparently made before the time of Tertullian ('De Prescript.,' &sect; 26). The thought is stir primarily of the light itself being  necessarily seen rather than of its benefiting others (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). To all. For in a room none can help noticing it, even though the lamp and the light itself be but small. The negative of this verse is given in Pseudo-Cyprian, 'De Aleat.,' 3, "Monet dominus et dicit: nolite contris tare Spiritum Sanctum, qui in vobis est, et <span class="accented">nolite exstinguere lumen</span>, <span class="accented">quod in vobis efful sit"</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 111, 215).

Our Lord has here no thought of effort in shining, such as may improve the brightness of the light given, or of illuminating others, but of not concealing what light the disciples have. (For a similar <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>.)

This is actually done in ch. 9:8; 15:31. St. Peter's language (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>) is probably due to a reminiscence of our Lord's words. <span class="cmt_word">Your Father which is in heaven</span>. The Fatherhood of God is here predicated in a special sense of the disciples, in the same way as the Fatherhood of God is, in the Old Testament, always connected with his covenant relation to his people as a nation (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> here is not thinking of the original relation of God to being and especially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the Divine image (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), but of the relation into which the disciples have entered through the revelation of God in Christ; cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a> (Add. Note) and on <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a> (Add. Note); also Weiss, 'Life,' 2:348. The phrase, which occurs here for the first time in St. Matthew (but cf. ver. 9, note), henceforth occurs frequently, becoming of great importance for this Gospel (cf. vers. 45, 48; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 9</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17- <a href="../../par/matthew/6-18.htm">Matthew 6:18</a>.</span> - Having spoken of the ideal character of his disciples (vers. 3-10), and of their need of allowing that character to appear (vers. 11-16), our Lord turns to speak of <span class="accented">the position that they should hold towards the religion of the day</span> (ver. 17 - <a href="../../par/matthew/6-18.htm">Matthew 6:18</a>), of which the Law was the accepted standard. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-20.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> With this aim he first states summarily and in nucleus the position that he himself holds towards the Law - a statement which was the more necessary as he had already (ver. 11) claimed to be the object of his disciples' devotion. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Think not</span>.

In both cases the tendency of the new teaching (<a href="../../par/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>) to abolish temporary forms was perceived by at least those whose powers of perception were quickened through their opposition. <span class="cmt_word">That I am come</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">that I came</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Our Lord, both here and in the next clause, lays stress on his coming as an historic fact. The primary reference is probably to his coming forth from private life (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>). Yet in his own mind there may have been a further allusion to his coming from above (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; and further, <a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy</span>.

Alford), and being used because of the negative. Such a distribution, however, though it could not have been expressed in an affirmative sentence, has for its background the consciousness of a difference in the nature of these two chief components of the Old Testament.  Observe that the third part of the Hebrew Scriptures, "the (Holy) Writings" - of which 'Psalms' (<a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>) form the most characteristic portion - is omitted in this summary reference to the Old Testament. The reason may be either that of the three parts it was used less than the other two as a basis for doctrine and for rule of life, or that it was practically included in the Prophets (<a href="../../par/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>). The essential teaching of the Law may be distinguished from that of the Prophets by saying that, while the Law was the direct revelation of God's will as law for the people's daily life - personal, social, and national - the Prophets (including the historical books and the prophets proper) were rather the indirect revelation of his will for them under the fresh circumstances into which they came; this indirect revelation being seen more especially in God's providential guidance of the nation, and in his explanation of principles of worship, as well as in occasional predictions of the future. It is to his relation to the Prophets in this connexion, as an indirect revelation of God's will under changing circumstances (cf. Weiss) that our Lord here chiefly refers. For he is led to speak of his own relation to them from the bearing that this has on the conduct of his disciples. Many, however (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Chrysostom), consider that he is thinking of his relation to them as containing predictions concerning himself. In answer to this it is not sufficient to say (Meyer, Weiss, Alford) that it was impossible that Messiah could be thought to abrogate the Prophets; for, in fact, to many Jews during his ministry (even if not at this early stage of it), and much more to Jews at the time when the evangelist recorded the words, our Lord must have seemed to contradict the predictions about himself as they were then understood. It is indeed true that <span class="accented">the prima facie</span> ground that existed for thinking that our Lord's teaching was opposed, not merely to the religion of the day as dependent on the Law and the Prophets, but also to the predictions of Messiah contained in them, is enough to give a certain plausibility to this interpretation. But that is all. The absence in the context of any hint that he refers to his relation to predictions as such quite forbids our accepting it. It was probably derived solely from a misinterpretation of "ful<span class="accented">fil"</span> (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), no regard being paid to the train of thought by which our Lord was led to speak of the subject at all. Our Lord says that he is not come to "destroy" the Prophets as <span class="accented">exponents of the will of God. <span class="cmt_word"></span>I</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>am not come to destroy</span>; emphasizing his statement by repetition. <span class="cmt_word">But to fulfil</span>. By establishing the absolute and final meaning of the Law and the Prophets. Christ came not to abrogate the Law or the Prophets, but to satisfy them - to bring about in his own Person, and ultimately in the persons of his followers, that righteousness of life which, however limited by the historical conditions under which the Divine oracles had been delivered, was the sum and substance of their teaching. The fulfilment of the Law and the Prophets "is the perfect development of their ideal reality out of the positive form, in which the same is historically apprehended and limited" (Meyer). Martensen puts the matter thus: "How can he say that not a tittle shall pass from the Law, since the development of the Church shows us that the ceremonial law, that the whole Mosaic dispensation, has been annihilated by the influences proceeding from Christ? We answer: He has fulfilled the Law, whilst he has released it from the temporary forms in which its eternal validity was confined; he has unfolded its spiritual essence, its inward perfection. Not even a tittle of the ceremonial law has passed away, if we regard the Mosaic Law as a whole; for the ideas which form its basis, as the distinction between the unclean and the clean, are confirmed by Christ, and contained in the law of holiness which he teaches men" ('Christian Ethics: General,' &sect; 125); cf. ver. 18, notes, "till heaven and earth pass," "till all be fulfilled." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Cf. <a href="../../par/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail" (Revised Version). The words are so similar that the two evangelists probably record the same utterance, the difference in the form of the sentence pointing rather to an oral than a written common source. St. Luke places it in an attack on the Pharisees, who had scoffed at our Lord for his parable of the dishonest steward. <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>, literally, "established," "sure"). It has hardly been sufficiently noticed by commentators that the New Testament usage of the word "Amen" often slightly differs from that found in the Old Testament. "Amen" in the Old Testament always involves the personal acceptance of the statement to which it refers ("so be it"), whether this be a statement upon oath (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, perhaps), or a statement of penalties incurred under certain circumstances (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, probably; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); or a statement expressing a pious hope uttered either by another (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a> (?); cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>); or by one's self (<a href="../../par/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>). Hence the LXX. either leaves it untranslated or, with but one exception, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. In Hellenistic Greek, however, it became often used as little more  than a mere asseveration ("verily"). The earliest trace of this usage is found in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>, where the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila much better <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, though generally elsewhere <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), and it is frequent in the New Testament, cf. especially <a href="../../par/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, with parallels, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. also <a href="../../par/luke/12-44.htm">Luke 12:44</a> with <a href="../../par/matthew/24-47.htm">Matthew 24:47</a>, and <a href="../../par/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/12-43.htm">Mark 12:43</a>). Yet this usage of "Amen" in Hellenistic Greek does not seem to have ever spread into Hebrew or Aramaic. W. H. Lowe ('Fragm. Pesach.,' p. 70) says, and apparently truly, "The Jews never used 'amen in the sense of 'verily.' They say <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">be'emeth</span>', 'in truth,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hemanutha</span>, 'Faith!' or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span>, '<span class="accented">omnam</span>, 'verily.'" If so, the fact is interesting, for it implies that, notwithstanding the usage of "Amen" in Greek, our Lord himself, as speaking Aramaic, probably did not use it in the mere sense of strong asseveration, but rather always with its connotation of his entire concurrence in the statement he was making. In his mouth, that is to say, it always emphasized the thought of his personal acceptance of the statement with its legitimate issue. Observe that it makes no difference (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>) whether the "Amen" comes at the beginning or at the end of his utterance. N.B. - <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>) may be taken as intermediate between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> states a truth; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> assents with the intellect; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, in at least Hebrew and Aramaic usage, accepts it with all its consequences (cf <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till heaven and earth pass</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">pass away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>); and so in the next clause. The same almost archaic sense of "pass" recurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>, Authorized Version (Revised Version, "pass away"). Observe that our Lord does not say that the Law will then pass away. He says, not till then; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he affirms, as in <a href="../../par/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, that it is <span class="accented">easier</span> for heaven and earth to pass away than for the Law. For, in fact, as being constantly fulfilled in its ideal and therefore permanent character, it must necessarily remain in the new world; cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> (the everlasting duration of the word of the Lord); <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> (love); <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a> (righteousness); cf. Meyer. The belief in the permanence of the Law which the Jews had (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Meyer, and especially Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect;&sect; 5, 84) here finds its true satisfaction. "The least element of holiness which the Law contains has more reality and durability than the whole visible universe" (Godet on Luke). Comp. also <a href="../../par/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>, "My words shall not pass away" - a claim only seen in its full three when put beside these words about the Law. <span class="cmt_word">One jot</span>.

Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of <span class="accented">yod</span>, evidently because of its small size, is one proof of the fact that the Hebrew characters in use in our Lord's time were much more similar to the usual form under which we know them (<span class="accented">Quadrate schrift</span>) than to the form found on the Moabite Stone (Phoenician), where the <span class="accented">god</span> is no smaller than other letters (<span class="accented">vide</span> Euting's very complete table of forms of the Hebrew alphabet in Chwolsen, 'Corp.

Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect; 27, 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and the article on Akiba in 'Dict. of Christian Biogr.'). If it be objected that our Lord could hardly refer to these marks of traditional explanation as of such permanence, the answer is that in so far as these expressed legitimate issues (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 21) of the Mosaic Law, he could place them on the same level as that Law itself. <span class="cmt_word">Till all</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">till all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all things in the Law - all the requirements of the Law, in contrast to the one "jot" or "tittle" just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Till all be fulfilled</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be accomplished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The clause is probably epexegetical of "till heaven and earth pass away." Nothing in the Law shall pass away till heaven and earth pass away, when, with a new heaven and earth, all the contents of the Law will be completely realized (cf. Nosgen) so that even then nothing in the Law shall pass away (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>).

One of these least commandments.</span> Not necessarily such as the Pharisees reckoned least, in their enumeration of small and great, but such as our Lord himself symbolized by "jot" or "tittle;" those precepts which in reality are the least important (Meyer). Chrysostom strangely says that our Lord here refers, not to old laws, but to those which he was about to lay down; similarly Bengel thinks of vers. 22-28, etc. While the Jews distinguished carefully between small and great precepts, they insisted on the importance of keeping even the smallest; cf. 'Ab.,' 4:5 (Taylor), "Hasten to a slight precept.., for the reward of precept is precept." <span class="cmt_word">And shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach men so.</span> Doing his best to abrogate it, not only in his own person by neglect or violation, but also for others by teaching them to disregard it. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be called the least</span>. The Revised Version omits "he, .... the." He is not cast out of the kingdom ("Ubi nisi magni esse non possunt," Augustine), but his want of moral insight (did he consider it "breadth of thought"?) leads to his being called <span class="accented">least</span> in the kingdom. It is the converse of the parable in <a href="../../par/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc. There faithfulness in a very little (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>) wins much; here disregard of a very little causes a person to be reckoned (ver. 9, note) as very little - the principle of judgment being that of <a href="../../par/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in avery little is unrighteous also in much." <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably in its full and final establishment.

Similarly the Revised Version; but rather supply "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is required in the smallest commandment" (Meyer). The personal performance and conscious spreading of one of the least commandments will be found to involve so much that it gains for the person a high position. <span class="cmt_word">Do and teach</span>.

Why inserted here and not in the previous clause? Partly because of the awkwardness of inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there so soon after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>; partly because our Lord wished to lay stress there on the recompense, here on the person ("he and no other") who receives recompense. On the thought, cf. 'Test. XII. Parr.' (Levi., &sect; 13), "If he teach these things and practise them, he shall share the throne of the king, as also Joseph our brother." It is worth adding Tyndale's remark in his 'Exposition,' "Whosoever shall first fulfil them  [these least commandments following] himself, and then teach other, and set all his study to the furtherance and maintaining of them, that doctor shall all they of the kingdom of heaven have in price, and follow him and seek him out, as doth an eagle her prey, and cleave to him as burrs." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Matthew only. The verse from "except" to the end is quoted verbally in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 105), as being in "the Memoirs." <span class="cmt_word">For I say</span>. So far from you my disciples (ver. 13) being right in despising any of the commands contained in the Law, they are all to be specially honoured by you; <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="cmt_word">your righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the righteousness you show in observing them; there is no thought here of the imputed righteousness of Christ) must far exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees; otherwise there is no entrance for you into the kingdom of heaven. But wherein lay the superiority of the righteousness which the disciples were to have? Did our Lord mean that his disciples were to painfully toil through the various enactments, ceremonial and other, of the Law as the scribes and Pharisees did, only with more serious and earnest purpose than they? That were in the case of many scribes and Pharisees hardly possible. For notwithstanding our Lord's occasional denunciations, many of them were men of the severest earnestness and the deepest conscientiousness, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Gamaliel and Saul of Tarsus. Our Lord must refer to the Law otherwise than as a system of enactments. His thought is similar to that of his words addressed to Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), where he says that change of heart evidenced by public profession (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>) is necessary for entrance into the kingdom of God (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a>). So here; while the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, even when joined to earnestness of purpose, nevertheless consists in the observance of external rules, there is a higher principle in the Law, by observing which a higher righteousness can be attained. Christ points, that is to say, away from the Law as a system of external rules to the Law in its deeper meaning, affecting the relation of the heart to God (cf. further Weiss, 'Life,' 2:147). <span class="cmt_word">Shall exceed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall abound still more than.</span> The statement is not merely comparative, but implies an abundance (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>)even in the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.

A much stronger statement than that of ver. 19, though some would identify the two. There Christ was comparing one disciple with another; here his disciples with non-disciples. "Such a relaxing for yourselves and others of the commandments will <span class="accented">set you low</span> in the true kingdom of obedience and holiness; but this of having a righteousness so utterly false and hollow as that of the scribes and Pharisees will not merely set you low, but will exclude you from that kingdom altogether (ver. 20); for while that marks an <span class="accented">impaired</span> spiritual vision, this marks a vision utterly darkened and destroyed" (Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-48.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) Our Lord is still concerned with the relation of himself and his followers to the religion of the day, of which the Old Testament (ver. 17), and more especially the Law (ver. 18), was the accepted standard. But after having spoken of the need of careful attention to (vers. 17,18), and observance of (ver. 19), even the least commands of the Law, he goes on to point out the far-reaching character of these commands, whether they are such as we should call more (vers. 21, 27, 81) or less (vers. 33, 38, 43) impotent. It is essential to notice that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> refers to these commands, not merely as statements contained in the Law, but as part of the religion of the day, and that he contrasts their true bearing on life and conduct with that false bearing on this which was commonly predicated of them. By this it is not meant that our Lord was only opposing such narrow glosses and interpretations as had arisen at various times during the centuries after the promulgation of the Law (for these were for the most part perfectly natural and legitimate developments of the earliest possible interpretations of it), still less that he was thinking only of the worst of the misrepresentations of its commands, comparatively recently made by the Pharisees; but  that he was now going back, beyond this so far natural and normal development of the earliest interpretations, to the first principles underlying the revelation contained in the Law. While the Jews, not unnaturally, clung to the primary, but temporary, meaning of the Law as a revelation of God's will for them as a nation, our Lord was now about to expound its commands as a revelation of God's permanent will for them and all men as men. Our Lord was now, that is to say, wishing to do more than merely cut off the excrescences that, chiefly through the Pharisaic party, had grown up round the Law, but less than root up the Law itself. He rather cuts down the whole growth that had been, notwithstanding some mere excrescences, the right and proper outcome of the Law in its original environment, in order that, in fresh environment, which corresponded better to its nature, the Law might produce a growth still more right and proper. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-26.</span> - <span class="accented">The sixth commandment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24</span> Matthew only; vers. 25, 26 have parts common to Luke. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, frequentative aorist). Our Lord does not say, "ye have read" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>), for he was not now speaking to the learned classes, but to a large audience many of whom were probably unable to read. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from your teachers whose teaching claims to be the substance of the Law. So, probably, even in <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>, where the multitude say that they "have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth for ever," which, since this is hardly expressed in so many words in the Old Testament, must mean that the instructions they have received on this subject truly represent the substance of its teaching. So here our Lord says, "You have heard from your teachers (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>) that the substance of the sixth commandment is so-and-so." It is thus quite intelligible that in some of these utterances there should be found added to (vers. 21, 43) or intermingled with (ver. 33) the words of a passage of Scripture, other words which are <span class="accented">either</span> taken from Scripture, but from another place in it (perhaps ver. 33), or do not occur in Scripture at all, but merely help to form a compendious statement of a definite interpretation (here and ver. 43). It must remain doubtful whether our Lord himself formulated these statements of the popular teaching, or quoted them verbally as current. If the latter, as is perhaps more likely, there remains the at present still more insoluble question whether they were only oral or (cf. the case of the 'Didaehe') had already been committed to writing (cf. in this connexion Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 480). <span class="cmt_word">That it was said by them of old time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">.

In the following words our Lord speaks of three grades of auger, and, as answering to them, of three grades of punishment. The former will be examined under the several terms employed. Upon the latter it is necessary to make a few remarks here. They have been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" means the judgment of God alone, for he alone can take cognizance of mere anger; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council" means the judgment of the Sanhedrin, "a publick tryal;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" means the judgment of hell (Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" means the local court; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council" means the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" means hell (apparently Nosgen, and many other, especially Romish, expositors). It will be noticed that both the above interpretations are inconsistent. They make our Lord pass from literal to figurative language in the same sentence. Besides, in the second it is inexplicable how mere anger could be brought under the cognizance of a human court. For these reasons it is probable that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> all three stages express metaphorically grades of Divine judgment under the form of the Jewish processes of law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" primarily means the local court; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council "primarily means the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" primarily means the Valley of Hinnom, where the last processes of judgment seem to have taken place (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Christ does not say that the sins spoken of render a man liable to any of these earthly processes of law; he says that they render him liable to processes of Divine law which are fittingly symbolized by these expressions. (So Alford, Mansel, and especially Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount,' p. 190). <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever is angry</span>; Revised Version, more precisely, every one who (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This form of expression is specially frequent in 1 John, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> 3:3, where Bishop Westcott says, "In each case where this characteristic form of language occurs there is apparently a reference to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in particular cases," (For the thought of this clause, cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">With his brother.</span> The term "brother" was applied in both Greek and Hebrew, by way of metaphor, to things that possessed merely such fellowship as arises from juxtaposition or from similarity of purpose (cf. of the cherubim, <a href="../../par/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>, "with their faces one to another," literally, "each (man) to his brother"). It is thus possible that here the thought is of any person with whom one is brought into temporary relation, quite apart from any question of a common source. Yet as this could have been represented by "neighbour" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>), it seems reasonable to see something more in "brother," and to view it with reference to its implied meaning, "fellowship of life based on identity of origin" (Cremer). To Jews as such the term would doubtless only suggest identity of origin nationally, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Jew (cf. especially <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>a with 16, 17b, 18; so even <a href="../../par/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>); but to Christians of the time when the Gospel was written rather identity of spiritual origin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Christian. Probably when the expression fell from Christ's lips not one of those who heard him imagined that it could have any wider meaning than fellow-Jew or fellow-believer on Jesus, and probably most of them limited it to the former. In fact, Christ seems to have used it as a means whereby to lead up his hearers from the idea of a national to that of a spiritual relation (cf. vers. 47, 48). We are therefore hardly warranted (far-reaching as the word on Christ's lips is) in seeing here any reference to the thought of the universal brotherhood of man, based on the fact of all being children of one common Father (cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Without a</span> <span class="cmt_word">cause</span>. Omitted by the Revised Version; Revised Version margin, "many ancient authorities insert <span class="accented">without cause."</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span>, though found in the Old Latin and Old Syriac, is certainly to be omitted, with R, B, and Vulgate, notwithstanding Dean Burgon ('Revision,' p. 358); cf. especially Westcott and Hurt, 'App.' It is redundant, because the two following expressions show that the anger itself is unloving and hostile (cf. further Meyer). There is a holy anger, but that is with a brother's sin, not with the brother himself (cf. Augustine, in Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of the judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God's wrath as symbolized by the lowest degree of Jewish trial (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And whosoever</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>). For in this case there was no need for the emphasizing inclusiveness of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Raca</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Augustine's explanation (in los.; vide Trench; cf. also 'In Joann. Evang.,' &sect; 51:2; 'De Doctr.

St. James uses its equivalent (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;</span>, 2:20) in solemn warning; but it was not infrequently used as a mere term of angry abuse (cf. Lightfoot, ' Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, and Levy, s.v.). Buxtorf, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>, compares a favourite expression of Aben Ezra's, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, "empty-heads," for those who raise senseless objections, etc.; but the simple expression in our text refers rather to moral deficiency thorn to deficiency of brain. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">council</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and.</span> The Authorized Version interpolates an emphasis on the climax. <span class="cmt_word">Thou fool</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> This is probably the Greek word for "fool," equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">nabal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), which was often used in the Old Testament of the folly of wickedness (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>). In this sense <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used by our Lord himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a> [19]). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It may be the transliteration (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5db;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) of the Hebrew <span class="accented">moreh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>), "rebel" (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>). (So Revised Version margin, Weiss. Nosgen.) In favour of this is the parallelism cf. language with <span class="accented">Raca.</span> The sense, too, is excellent, "Thou rebel against God!" It is almost equivalent to "Apostate!" But the absence of any evidence that the Jews used <span class="accented">moreh</span> as a term of abuse prevents our accepting this interpretation. Field ('Otium Norv.,' 3.) points out that if this interpretation were true, <span class="accented">moreh</span> would be "the <span class="accented">only</span> pure Hebrew word in the Greek Testament (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;</span>, as being taken from the LXX., belong to a different class), all other foreign words being indisputably Aramaic, as <span class="accented">raca</span>, <span class="accented">talitha kumi</span>, <span class="accented">maranatha</span>, etc., which, as might have been expected, are retained by the authors of the Syriac versions without alteration. Not so <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x37e;</span>, for which both the Peschito and Philoxenian versions have <span class="accented">lelo</span> ()...  a plain proof that these learned Syrians look it for an exotic, and not like <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>, a native word." In either case. the term expresses the absolute godlessness of him who is so addressed. Of the two terms, <span class="accented">Raca</span> is more negative, implying the absence of all good, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span> more positive, implying decided wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The change from the usual dative to the unique construction with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated by the Revised Version margin, "Greek, unto or into," is doubtless because our Lord no longer refers to the tribunal at which the punishment is ordered, but to the punishment itself into which the condemned man comes (cf. Wirier, &sect; 31:5). <span class="cmt_word">Hell fire</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the hell of fire</span>; Revised Version margin, "Greek, Gehenna of fire" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Gehenna is properly "the Valley of Hinnom" (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>b; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), or "of the son of Hinnom" (Joshuaxv. 8; 16:18a; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). It is probably the valley on the south-west of Jerusalem (see, however, W. F. Birch, in Palestine Exploration Fund Report, January, 1889, pp. 39, 42, who places it between the two parts of Jerusalem, identifying it with the Tyropoeon Valley of Josephus, neglecting, however, to explain how so central a position is consistent with the "fire." In it was the spot where human sacrifices were offered to Moloch (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; and Rawlinson, on <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), called the Topheth, "the place of horror" (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Payne Smith, on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>); and in it, presumably on the same place, were burnt, according to Jewish tradition (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Kimchi, on <a href="../../par/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>), the carcases of animals and other offal. There is no direct evidence that the bodies of criminals (as is often stated) were burnt there. But it seems probable that it was in this place that death by "burning," whether it was the later method of "burning" by a red-hot wire, or the earlier (Mishna, 'San-hedr.,' 7:2) of lighting faggots of wood round the condemned person, would be carried into effect. Thus both from the old associations of the valley, and from the then use made of it, the epithet "of fire" would be very naturally added. It seems probable that our Lord here referred primarily to "Gehenna" in this local sense (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), but it is fair to notice that there is no other instance in the New Testament of this literal usage of the word. Elsewhere it is always in the metaphorical sense common in rabbinic writings of the place of final punishment which we usually call "hell." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. Seeing that the consequences of an angry spirit are so terrible. For there is no thought here of an unforgiving spirit spoiling the acceptance of the gift (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Our Lord is insisting that it is so important to lose no time in seeking reconciliation with a person whom one has injured, that even the very holiest action must be put off for it. <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou bring</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">if... thou art offering</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> (similarly, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, ver. 24), the technical word coming some sixty times in Leviticus alone. Christ implies that the action has already begun. <span class="cmt_word">Thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">gift</span>; a general word for any sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">To the altar</span>. Since those to whom he spoke were still Jews, Christ illustrates his meaning by  Jewish practices. A perverse literalism has found here a direct reference to the Eucharist. For reasonable <span class="accented">adaptations</span> (cf. even in ' Didache,' &sect; 14.) of these two verses to this, see Waterland, 'Doctrine of the Eucharist,' ch. 13. &sect; 4 (pp. 359-362, Oxford, 1868). <span class="cmt_word">And there rememberest</span>, etc. For the spirit of recollection may well culminate with the culminating action. Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.') shows that even the Jews taught such a postponement of the sacrifice if theft was remembered. He therefore thinks that the stress is on "ought" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>): "For that which the <span class="accented">Jews</span> restrained only to pecuniary damages, Christ extends to all offences against our brother." But he overlooks the fact that, while the Jewish precept had reference to a sin (or even the neglect of some ceremonial rule, cf. Mishna, 'Pes.,' 3:7) vitiating the offering, there is no thought of this hero (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy brother</span> (ver. 22, note). <span class="cmt_word">Ought</span>. So from Tyndale downwards. Revised Version, <span class="accented">aught</span>, here and apparently always, after the spelling now preferred as marking the difference from the verb.

Joined in the Authorized Version and Revised Version to "be reconciled," and rightly, since the point is not "the unavoidable, surprising, nay, repellent removal of one's self from the temple" (Meyer), but reconciliation. <span class="cmt_word">Be reconciled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>); here only in the New Testament. There seems to be no essential difference between this and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Thayer).

The question of the relation of the two passages, as regards both language and original connexion, is exceedingly difficult. As to the former, the verbal differences seem to be such as would hardly have been made on purpose, and to be rather due to memory; yet the agreement is too minute to be the result of memory of a Gospel only oral. Perhaps memory of a document best satisfies the conditions. As to the original connexion of the verses, they, especially ver. 26, can hardly have been spoken twice. Most critics suppose that St. Luke gives them in their proper context; but if so, it is curious that two of his words, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seem to recall our preceding ver. 24. One word might have been a mere coincidence, but hardly two. It is not likely that these words in ver. 24 were derived from <span class="accented">Luke</span>, for this <span class="accented">supposes</span> a double process in St. Matthew's mind, rejecting them from ver. 25 and placing them in ver. 24. It is more natural also to regard the first clause of <a href="../../par/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, "As...  him," as an expansion of the corresponding clause in our ver. 25 rather than this as a compression of that. This apparent reminiscence in Luke of what is given in our vers. 24 and 25a points to the connexion of vers. 24-26 in Matthew being original, and to it having been broken by Luke or by the framer of the source that he used. A further stage in our Lord's warning. A man must not only seek reconciliation with the injured person (ver. 23), and that in preference to fulfilling the holiest service (ver. 24), but he must do so the more because of the danger of postponing reconciliation. It is noteworthy that our Lord in this verse does not define on whose side the cause of the quarrel lies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Agree with</span>. And that not with a merely formal reconciliation, but reconciliation based on a permanent kindly feeling towards him (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).

"The way" is the road to the judge, as explained in -Luke. But being on the road to him is here not presented as a possibility (Luke), but as a certainty. For so, in fact, it is. <span class="cmt_word">Lest...  the adversary</span> (ver. 26, note) <span class="cmt_word">deliver</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> Translating from the language of parable to that of fact, it is only if reconciliation has not been made, if the heart is still unforgiving and quarrelsome, that God the Judge will take notice of the offence. <span class="cmt_word">And the judge...  to the officer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officer whose duty it was to execute the judge's commands (cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' for illustrations). The expression here belongs to the figure; but in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a> similar duties are predicated of the angels. If the figure was derived from the synagogue, the officer would doubtless be the <span class="accented">chazzan</span>, of which, indeed, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical rendering (cf. Schurer, II. 2. p. 66). <span class="cmt_word">And thou be cast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). The future indicative (still dependent on "lest") brings out the reality of the danger (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt by no means</span>, etc. A solemn statement of the unrelenting character of justice.

Christ affirms that non-reconciliation with a brother, if carried beyond that limit of time within which the quarrel can be made up, involves consequences in which the element of mercy will be entirely absent. The element of mercy can enter up to a certain point of time, but after that only justice. (On "pay," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x3c2;</span>, see <a href="../../par/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>, note.)

But it should not be forgotten that, in the parallel passage in Luke, the reference is to God. Offences against man are there represented in their true character as offences against God, who is therefore depicted as the adversary in a lawsuit. That, from another point of view, be is also the Judge, matters not. Both conceptions of him are true, and can be kept quite distinct. It may be the case, indeed, that this reference of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to God was present to St. Matthew's mind also when he recorded these words, and this would partly account for the terrible emphasis on ver. 26, the <span class="accented">pendant</span> to ver. 22. But even if the reference to God were present to St. Matthew's mind by way of application, it is not with him, as it is with St. Luke, the primary. signification of the word. <span class="cmt_word">Farthing</span>.

Yet, as St. Augustine points out, St. Paul took oaths in his writings (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>); and our Lord himself did not refuse to answer when put upon his oath (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63, 64</a>). He, that is to say, and St. Paul after him, accepted the fact that there are times when a solemn oath must be taken. How, then, can we explain this absolute prohibition here? In that our Lord is not here thinking at all of formal and solemn oaths, but of oaths as the outcome of impatience and exaggeration. The thoughtlessness of fervent asseveration is often betrayed into an oath. Such an oath, or even any asseveration that passes in spirit beyond "yea, yea," "nay, nay," has its origin <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; cf. Chaucer, "Sweryng sodeynly without avysement is eek a gret synne" ('Parson's Tale,' &sect; 'De Ira'). Martensen, however ('Ethics, Individual,' &sect; 100), takes the prohibition of oaths as formally unconditional and total, in accordance with the highest ideal of what man will hereafter be and require, and he sees the limitation, which he allows is to be given to these words, in the present conditions of human society. We have an ideal duty towards God, but we have also a practical duty to those among whom we live, and the present state of human affairs permits and necessitates oaths. Hence it was that even Christ submitted to them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither by heaven</span>, etc. Our Lord further defines what he means by an oath. It does not mean only an expression in which God's Name is mentioned, but any expression appealing to any object at all, whether this be supraterrestrial, terrestrial, national, or personal. Although God's Name is often omitted in such cases, from a feeling of reverence, its omission does not prevent the asseveration being an oath. <span class="accented">Heaven</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the heaven</span>; for the thought is clearly not the immaterial transcendental heaven, the abode of bliss, but the physical heaven (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Heaven...  footstool</span>. Adapted from <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where it forms part of the glorious declaration that no material temple can contain God, that "the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands" as St. Stephen paraphrases it (<a href="../../par/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>).

"These last two antitheses, which terminate in Matthew in the lofty thought (ver. 48) of man being elevated by love to the perfection of God, furnish Luke with the leading idea of the discourse as he presents it, namely, charity as the law of the new life." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - <span class="accented">The reception of injuries. </span> The Law inculcated that the injured should obtain from those who did the wrong exact compensation (on this being properly a command, not merely a permission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Mozley, 'Ruling Ideas,' etc., pp. 182, sqq.). Our Lord inculcates giving up of all in-sistance upon one's rights as an injured person, and entire submission to injuries, even as far as proffering the opportunity for fresh wrongs. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</span>. No short phrase could more accurately describe the spirit of the Mosaic legislation. Offences against individuals were to be punished by the injured individual receiving back, as it were, the exact compensation from him who had injured him. While this was originally observed literally, it was in Mishnic times (and probably in the time of our Lord) softened to payment of money (<span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). The phrase comes three times in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). Notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX. has the accusative in each case, although only in the first does a verb precede. Probably the expression had already become proverbial in Greek even before the translation of the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> is slightly different from that of the other two passages, and as the preposition there used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) is not so necessarily rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, that passage is perhaps the least likely of the three to have been in our Lord's mind now. It seems likely, however, that he was not thinking of any one of the three passages in particular. The words served him as a summary of the Law in this respect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a></div><div class="verse">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee,</span> etc. The first clause comes here only; the second is found also in <a href="../../par/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a> (for the principle, cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>). We may notice that, while our Lord most perfectly observed the spirit of this command, he did not slavishly follow the letter of it (cf. <a href="../../par/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22, 23</a>). Nor did St. Paul (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-35.htm">Acts 16:35</a><span class="accented">ff</span>; Acts 22:25; 23:3; 25:9,10). We must remember that, while he clothes his teaching with the form of concrete examples, these are only parabolic representations of principles eternal in themselves, but in practice to be modified according to each separate occasion. "This offering of the other cheek <span class="accented">may</span> be done outwardly; but only inwardly can it be always right" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). We must further remember the distinction brought out here by Luther between what the Christian has to do as a Christian, and what he has to do as, perhaps an official, member of the state. The Lord leaves to the state its own jurisdiction (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>: <span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer). <span class="accented">That ye resist not</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">resist not</span>, thus avoiding all possibility of the English reader taking the words as a statement of fact. <span class="accented">Evil</span>.

From the Persian. Hatch ('Essays,' p. 37) shows that while the classical usage strictly refers to the Persian system or' mounted couriers (described in Herod., 8:98; Xen., 'Cyr.,' 8:6. 17), the post-classical usage refers to the later development of a system, not of postal service, but of the forced transport of military baggage. It thus indicates, not merely  forced attendance, but forced carrying. Hence it is used in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-32.htm">Matthew 27:32</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/15-21.htm">Mark 15:21</a> of Simon the Cyrenian, "who was pressed by the Roman soldiers who were escorting our Lord not merely to accompany them but also to carry a load." Thus here also the thought is doubtless that of being compelled to carry baggage. There may also be a reference, as Hatch suggests, to the oppressive conduct of the Roman soldiers (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>). (For the spirit of our Lord's saying, <span class="accented">vide</span> also 'Aboth,' 3:18 (Taylor), where the probable translation is, "Rabbi Ishmael said, Be pliant of disposition and <span class="accented">yielding to impressment."</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>A mile</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">one mile</span>; but see <a href="../../par/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19</a>, note.

The connexion is as follows: Our Lord spoke first (ver. 39) of entire submission to injuries; then (ver. 40) of acceptance of loss of property; then (ver. 41) of acceptance of a burden imposed; here of acceptance of a demand for pecuniary assistance. This, in its turn, forms an easy transition to the subject of ver. 43, <span class="accented">sqq. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Give to him that asketh thee</span>, etc. This verse has been often adduced by unbelievers to prove the incompatibility of our Lord's utterances with the conditions of modern society. Wrongly. Because our Lord is inculcating the proper spirit of Christian life, not giving rules to be literally carried out irrespective of circumstances. Hammond (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ford) points out that we have "a countermand" in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:7, 10</a>. (For the possibility of accounting for the verbal differences between this verse and <a href="../../par/luke/6-30.htm">Luke 6:30</a> by supposing an Aramaic original, see Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891, p. 287.)

Our Lord now turns from the reception of injuries to the treatment of those who injure us. We are not to injure them in return, nor merely to keep aloof from them, but to show them positive kindness. The Law, in the natural development of it current at the time, taught very differently. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span>. - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have heard</span> (ver. 21, note). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy</span>. The first clause is found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, the second is the natural, and, from one point of view, legitimate, deduction from it. "The whole precept, as it stands, undoubtedly represents, and is a summary of, the sense of the Law" (Mozley, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). The meaning of the words "neighbour" and "enemy" has been much discussed. In Leviticus, indeed, the meaning of "neighbour" is clear; it answers to "the children of thy people" in the preceding clause, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it refers to members of the nation; all Israelites are termed "neighbours." The primary sense, therefore, of this whole precept is love to an Israelite, hatred to a non-Israelite (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). As such, the precept was of value in cementing the unity of the nation and preventing greater exposure to the evils, moral and religious, found outside it. But as quoted by our Lord, it has evidently a more private reference. He treats the precept as referring to personal friends (those who act in a neighbourly way) and enemies, and even this is, in some respects, a legitimate summary of the teaching of the Law, in so far as it forms another side of the law of retaliation. In days when public justice was weak much had to be left to the action of the individual, and he who was wronged was bid satisfy justice by retaliating on his enemy. That, however, it was not the only teaching of the Law is evident from <a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>). But as regards both aspects of the precept the time had come for a change. The Jews only too gladly showed obedience to the second part of the precept, making themselves proverbial (cf. Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:5. 2; Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:103) for their more than incivility to Gentiles, and they seem to have also zealously carried it out towards their personal enemies (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>.). On the whole subject, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Mozley ('Ruling Ideas,' pp. 188-200), who, however, hardly allows enough weight to passages like <a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a>.

If we may lay stress on the Greek, our Lord expresses the popular notion of the sun ascending. It must, however, be remembered that the word he himself probably used was <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;</span> in hiph.

Notice how, by chiasm, the emphasis is laid on the ungodly alike at the beginning and at the end. Our Lord here brings out God's active love as seen in nature, nourishing and maintaining men, irrespective of the qualities of individuals and of their treatment of him and his laws.

To this short description little need be added. The Roman system of taxation was to put up the country, or certain productions of the country, at auction, and to "sell" them to any who would undertake to pay the greatest amount of revenue from them (cf. also Josephus's account of the Egyptian method,  <span class="date">B.C. 250</span>, 'Ant.,' 12:04. 4; and Sayce's article in the <span class="accented">Jewish Quarterly</span>, July, 1890, on a Jewish taxgatherer at Thebes,  <span class="date">B.C. 140</span>). This contract was in turn divided and subdivided, those who actually drew the money from the people being generally natives. It thus being the interest of every contractor and sub-contractor to squeeze as much as possible from those under him, the whole system was demoralizing to all engaged in it. In the case of Judaea it was especially so, as there was a strong feeling among religious Jews against the lawfulness of paying taxes to a Gentile ruler (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>, note). It is no wonder, therefore, that we find the native collectors (even of districts where the money raised went to Antipas's treasury, <a href="../../par/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>, note) classed with "harlots" (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>), "sinners" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>), the heathen (ver. 4:7; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>).

While the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> emphasizes the contrast between Christ's disciples and those who  followed the usual deduction from the Law, the position of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (reversing that of Deuteronomy) shows that still greater emphasis is placed on their "perfection" as something to be attained. Also, while in the parallel passage of Luke the stress is upon the change that must take place (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>)  - unless, as is possible, it has the simple meaning "show yourselves" (cf. ver. 45, note) - in Matthew the possibility or even the certainty of attaining it is definitely stated. You shall make this your aim, and shall attain to it. <span class="accented">Therefore.</span> A deduction from the principle laid down in vers. 44-47. From the consideration of the example of your Father, and of the insufficiency of being like publicans and heathen. <span class="accented">Perfect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). In the Gospels here and <a href="../../par/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a> only. The word denotes those who have attained the full development of innate powers, in contrast to those who are still in the undeveloped state - adults in contrast to children. Thus the thought here is - Ye shall be satisfied with, and shall attain to, no lower state than that of maturity. But what is it as to which they shall be mature? Surely not the whole Law as illustrated by all the examples since ver. 21; for vers. 31, 32 are excluded by the comparison with God immediately following. It must be the subject with which the sentence is closely connected, vers. 44-47 (cf. Meyer); love to others even though they have done you wrong. In this respect, viz. love to others, you shall admit, says our Lord, no lower ideal than that of' maturity, even such maturity as is found in him who sends sun and rain on all alike. Some (Augustine, Trench) have seen in this a merely relative maturity, itself capable of further development; but the subject rather demands absolute and final maturity. This does not imply that man will ever have such fulness of love as the Father has, but that he will fully and completely attain to that measure of love to which he as a created being was intended to attain. It may, however, be in accordance with true exegesis to see, with Weiss, for such apparently is his meaning, also an indication of further teaching - the nature of the revelation made known by Christ. For whereas "the fundamental commandment" of the Old Testament, "Ye shall be holy; for I am holy" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44, 45</a>), was the more negative thought of God's exaltation above the impurity of created beings, our Lord now puts forth "the positive conception of the Divine perfection, whose nature is all-embracing, self-sacrificing love. And in place of the God, for ever separated from his polluted people by his holiness, to whom they can only render themselves worthy of approach through the most anxious abstinence from all impurity, and by means of the statutes for purification contained in the Law, there is on the ground of this new revelation the Father in heaven, who stoops to his children in love, and so operates that they must and can be like him" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:156). The simple and straightforward meaning of the verse, however, is this - You shall take no lower standard in love to enemies than God shows to those who ill treat him, and you shall, in fact, attain to this standard. Upon this (for the limitation of the meaning to one point makes no real difference) there arises the question which has been of so much importance in all ages of the Church - What is the measure of attainment that is really possible for Christ's disciples upon earth? ought they not to expect to live perfect lives? But the text gives no warrant for such an assertion. No doubt it says that attainment to maturity - to perfection according to creaturely limits <span class="cmt_word">-</span> is eventually possible. That is implied in <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). But <span class="accented">when</span> this attainment can be made is not stated. Many will, indeed, affirm that, as our Lord is giving directions to his disciples concerning things in this life, the attainment also is affirmed to be possible in this life. But this by no means follows. Christ gives the command, and by the form of it implies that it shall be carried out to the full. But this is quite consistent with the conception of a gradually increasing development of love which, in fact will attain maturity, a state in which God's love has ever been; but not immediately and not before the final completion of all Christ's work in us. The words form, indeed, a promise as well as a command, but the absence of a statement of time forbids us to claim the verse as a warrant for asserting that the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> referred to can be attained in this life. Trench ('Syr.,' &sect; 22.) explains the passage by saying that the adjective is used the first time in a relative, and the second time in an absolute, sense. But this does not seem as probable as the interpretation given above, according to which the adjective is in both cases used absolutely. His following words, however, deserve careful attention. "The Christian shall be ' perfect,' yet not in the sense in which some of the sects preach the doctrine of perfection, who, so soon as their words are looked into, are found either to mean nothing which they could not have expressed by a word less liable to misunderstanding; or to mean something which no man in this life shall attain, and which he who affirms he has attained is deceiving himself, or others, or both." <span class="cmt_word">Even as your Father which is</span> in <span class="cmt_word">heaven is perfect;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">as your heavenly Father is perfect</span>; so the manuscripts. The epithet, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is wanting  in Luke, but Matthew wishes to lay stress on their Father's character and methods being different from those of an earthly father. Observe again not "the Father" but your Father; nerving them to fulfil the summons to likeness to him (cf. ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/6.htm"><title>Matthew 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/5.htm" title="Matthew 5">&#9668;</a> Matthew 6 <a href="../matthew/7.htm" title="Matthew 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">relation of our Lord and his disciples to the religion of the day</span> (<span class="accented">continued</span>); <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, note.

It is, indeed, true that the performance of these duties on special occasions was implied in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a>); but there are no regulations concerning their observance in ordinary and daily life.

Probably a purely metaphorical expression (cf. our "He is his own trumpeter"). Edersheim, 'Temple,' etc., p. 27 (cf. Schottgen) sees rather in it an ironical allusion to the form and name of the treasure-chests in the court of the women. "The Lord, making use of the word 'trumpet,' describes the conduct of those who, in their almsgiving, sought glory from men as 'sounding a trumpet' before them - that is, carrying before them, as it were, in full display one of these trumpet-shaped alms-boxes (literally called in the Talmud, 'trumpets'), and, as it were, sounding it." This interpretation would have been less fanciful if the substantive had been used instead of the verb. Others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Calvin, Bengel) have taken it of a literal trumpet; but of this practice there is no evidence whatever. "I have not found, although I have sought for it much and seriously, even the least mention of a trumpet in almsgiving" (J. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). <span class="cmt_word">Before thee;</span> part of the metaphor, since one holds a trumpet up to one's mouth. <span class="cmt_word">As the hypocrites do.</span> The comma after "<span class="accented">do"</span> in the ordinary text of the Authorized Version (not in Scrivener) connects "do not sound a trumpet before thee" with "in the synagogues," etc., and more readily <span class="accented">suggests</span> the literal interpretation of "trumpet" to the English reader. <span class="accented">The hypocrites</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). In Attic usage the word means those who play a part upon the stage. Hence, by an easy transition to the moral sphere," hypocrisy" became used in later Greek of "the assumption of a part which masked [men's] genuine feelings, and made them appear otherwise than they were" (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>). Persons who assumed this part would indeed often be identical with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the term <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> may sometimes be used as synonymous with these (an extension of language which would be the more easy as the Hebrew word for "hypocrite" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5e4;</span>) implies not so much hypocrisy as pollution by sin); but there seems no need (contrast Hatch, 'Essays,' p. 91) to see any other connotation in the New Testament than "hypocrite."

For most suggestive remarks on the Lord's Prayer, both generally and in its greater difficulties of detail, compare by all means Chase, 'The Lord's Prayer in the Early Church:' (Cambridge Texts and Studies). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the prayer had already been given by the Lord in the sermon on the mount, "one of his disciples" would hardly afterwards have asked him to teach them to pray, as John also taught his disciples (<a href="../../par/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>. l). It is much more easy, therefore, to consider that the original occasion of its utterance is recorded by St. Luke, and that it therefore did not belong to the sermon on the mount as that discourse was originally delivered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A question that admits of a more doubtful answer is whether the more original form of the prayer is found in Matthew or in Luke. It will be remembered that in the true text of his Gospel, the latter does not record the words, "Which art in heaven," "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth," "But deliver us from evil," besides reading "day by day" instead of "this day," "sins" instead of "debts," and "for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us" instead of" as we also have forgiven our debtors." Most writers suppose St. Matthew's form to be the original, and St. Luke's to be only a shortened form. In favour of this are the considerations that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> St. Matthew's words, "Forgive us our debts," represent an older, because parabolic, form of expression than the apparently interpretative "Forgive us our sins" in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> St. Matthew's words, "as we also," seem to be expanded into "for we ourselves also," in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> St. Luke's "day by day" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in his writings (<a href="../../par/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), so that it is likely to be his own phrase, and therefore less original than St. Matthew's "this day" (cf. Weiss, 'Matthiaus-Ev.,' and Page, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, III. 7:436). On the ether hand, the words, "Which art in heaven," are so characteristic of St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32, 33</a>; cf. 12:50; 15:13; 18:10, 14, 19, 35; 23. 9), and especially of the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11, 21</a>; cf. 5:45, 48; 6:14, 26, 32), that it seems more natural to suppose that this clause at least was added by him or by the authors of his sources to the original form, rather than that it was omitted by St. Luke. In connexion with this it may be pointed out how easy it was for our Lord to say only "Father" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) immediately after his own prayer to him (<a href="../../par/luke/11-1.htm">Luke 11:1</a>). Taking everything into consideration, it seems reasonable to arrive at two conclusions. First, that the form in Luke presents, <span class="accented">as a whole</span>, the more primitive and original instruction of the Lord, and that that given in Matthew presents the Lord's words as fully developed, partly perhaps by himself directly, partly by his indirect guidance of Christian usage. St. Matthew's Gospel would thus at once both show the effect and be the cause of the preference for the longer form in liturgical use. Secondly, and more exactly, that both the evangelists record the prayer after it had passed through some development in different parts of the Church, St. Matthew giving it a generally later stage, but preserving one or two clauses in an earlier and better form. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this manner therefore</span>. <span class="accented">Therefore</span>; in contrast to the heathen practice, and in the full confidence which you have in your almighty Father's intuitive knowledge of your needs. <span class="accented">After this manner</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). Not "in these words;" but he will most closely imitate the manner who most often reminds himself of it by using the words. <span class="cmt_word">Pray ye</span>. "Ye" emphatic - ye my disciples; ye the children of such a Father. <span class="cmt_word">Our</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>. In English we just lack the power to keep, with a plural possessive pronoun (contrast "father mine"), the order of Christ's words (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) which other languages possess (<span class="accented">Pater noster</span>; <span class="accented">Vater unser</span>). Christ places in the very forefront the primary importance of the recognition of spiritual relationship to God. There is no direct thought here of God as the All-Father in the modern and often deistic sense. Yet it is affirmed elsewhere in Scripture   (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/15-21.htm">Luke 15:21</a>), and spiritual relationship is perhaps only possible because of the natural relationship (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, note). <span class="accented">Our.</span> Though the prayer is here given with special reference to praying alone (ver. 6), the believer is to be reminded at once that he is joined by spiritual relationship to many others who have the same needs, etc., as himself. <span class="cmt_word">Which art in heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Added in this fuller form of the prayer (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), on the one hand to definitely exclude the application of the words however mediately to any human teacher (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and on the other to remind those who pray of the awful majesty of him whom they address. "They are a <span class="accented">Sursum corda</span>; they remind us that now we have lifted up our hearts from earth and things earthly to another and a higher world" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Hallowed be thy name</span>. The first of the three prayers for the furtherance of God's cause. Their parallelism is seen much more clearly in the Greek than in the English order of the words. Thy name. We look on a name almost as an accidental appendage by which a person is designated, but in its true idea it is the designation of a person which exactly answers to his nature and qualities. Hence the full Name of God is properly that description of him which embraces all that he really is. As, however, the term "name" implies that it is expressed, it must, when it is used of God, be limited to that portion of his nature and qualities which can be expressed in human terms, because it has been already made known to us. The "name" of God, here and elsewhere in the Bible, therefore, does not mean God in his essence, but rather that manifestation of himself which he has been pleased to give, whether partial and preparatory as under the old covenant (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a> [16:13]; 32:29; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>), or final as under the new (cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>); or again (to take another division found in Exell's 'Biblical Illustrator,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) the manifestation of himself through nature, through inspired words, through the Incarnation. Compared with the Glory (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) "the Name expresses the revelation as it is apprehended and used by man. Man is called by the Name, and employs it. The Glory expresses rather the manifestation of the Divine as Divine, as a partial disclosure of the Divine Majesty not directly intelligble by man (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, ft.)" (Bishop Westcott,' Add. Note' on <a href="../../par/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1:7</a>). <span class="accented">Hallowed be.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> cannot here, as sometimes (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>), mean "be made holy," for this God's manifestation of himself already is; but "be counted holy," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in human judgment. The prayer is that God's manifestation of himself may be acknowledged and revered as the one supreme standard of truth and the one means of knowing God and approaching him; of <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, where "<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> obviously means 'set apart, enshrined as the object of supreme, absolute reverence, as free from all defilement and possessed of all excellence'" (Johnstone, <span class="accented">in lee.</span>); cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>. The same thought appears to have been the basis of the early Western alternative petition (Marcion's or Tertullian's, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' <a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) for the gift of the Holy Spirit; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the address to the Father was followed by a prayer for purification by the Holy Spirit preparatory to the prayer, "Thy kingdom come." A man must accept God's manifestation of himself before he can take part in the spread of the kingdom. Gregory of Nyssa (<span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, lee. <span class="accented">cit.</span>, and Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 398) says distinctly, "Let thy Holy Spirit come upon us and purify us;" but he <span class="accented">substitutes</span> this prayer for the words, "Thy kingdom come." (For the support afforded by this to the theory that the Lord's Prayer circulated in a varying form, cf. Chase, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.) Gregory's petition, as affecting only humanity, is less comprehensive than that found m o r Gospels. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thy kingdom come.

The prayer passes from the personal acceptance in the heart of God's revelation of himself to the consequent result. The clause has a much wider meaning than the development and spread of the Church, or even the personal return of Christ at the second advent. It speaks of that which shall be the issue of both this and that, the final and perfect establishment of God's realm, in which all men will do him willing service, and all habits and customs, individual and social, will be such as he approves of (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 25.). Dr. C. Taylor ('Sayings,' etc., Exc. 5.) points out that the coming of the kingdom and the sanctifying of the Name are brought together in <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; Weiss, ' Life,' 2:349, with many others, says that our Lord probably adapted the frequent Jewish prayer for the coming of the kingdom of Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thy will</span> <span class="cmt_word">be done.</span> Let thy will come into complete existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>; cf. "Let there be light," <a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, LXX.). The thought is not merely God's will realized in this or that action, whether performed or endured by us (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-42.htm">Matthew 26:42</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-14.htm">Acts 21:14</a>), but God's will as a whole coming into full being. God's will is always in ideal until it is accomplished in act. The connexion of the clause with what has gone before is therefore this - the acceptance of God's manifestation of himself leads to the establishment of his realm, and this to the realization of his will, which until then is only ideal (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, note, end). If this be all the meaning of the words, they express, in fact, only the ultimate result of the consummation prayed for in the preceding clause (hence this portion of the prayer was in itself complete without our present words; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>); but since it is so far a distinct thought that it would not immediately suggest itself, it has a worthy place in the fuller form of the prayer. Possibly, however, more may be intended. The full establishment of the kingdom may be only a part of his loving will, which may, for all we know, have countless other things in view. The highest prayer that we can make in the furtherance of God's cause is that his gracious purpose, his will (whatever it may include) may be fully brought about. In earth, as it is in heaven; <span class="accented">as in heaven</span>, <span class="accented">so on earth</span> (Revised Version). Probably the words are to be joined to only the immediately preceding clause. In heaven God's will is already realized; not yet on earth, where sin has entered.

On the whole, perhaps (3) (a) presents the least difficulties. Bread. It is very doubtful if to use this petition of spiritual food is anything more than a legitimate application (made, indeed, as early as the 'Didache,' &sect; 10.) of words which in themselves refer only to material food (see further Chase, loc. cit.).

In the 'Didache,' &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 10, however, we find our doxology with very little other variation than the omission of "the kingdom," this itself being explained in the two latter sections by the immediately preceding mention of the kingdom. Similar omissions of one or more of the three terms, "kingdom, power, glory," are found in the Old Syriac, an "African" text of the Old Latin, and the Thebaic. "It was probably derived ultimately from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> (Hebrews), but, it may be, through the medium of some contemporary Jewish usage: the people's response to prayers in the temple is said to have been 'Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom for ever and ever'" (Westcott and Hort, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>). Indeed, it was so usual for doxologies of one kind or another to be added by the Jews to prayers, that, though we cannot for one moment accept the words here as genuine, we must consider it very doubtful in the Lord's Prayer was ever used in Jewish circles without a doxology, or that our Lord, as Man, ever intended it to be so used (cf. further, Taylor, 'Lectures,' p. 64). At all events, the feeling of the Christian Church in using the doxology is fully justified by its contents; for it places us more emphatically than ever in a right relation to God. By our praise to him it induces in us the remembrance that it is to God's <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that we belong, having him for King and Source of law; that it is by God's <span class="accented">power</span> that we live on earth and stand freed from Satan's grasp; that it is for the furtherance of God's <span class="accented">glory</span> that all has been done for us, all wrought in us, all these petitions are now made and all our hopes and aims are directed. Hereafter, as Bengel says. the whole prayer will be doxology: "Hallowed be the Name of our God. His kingdom has come; his will is done. He has forgiven us our sins. He has brought our temptation to an end; He has delivered us from the evil one. His is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever. Amen."

The excessive difficulty of Luke's ver. 36 points to Luke having preserved on the whole the more original form of the saying; but it seems quite impossible to say which is its more original position. It suits the context quite as well in Matthew as in Luke, while the mere verbal similarity of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may have caused it to be placed in Luke after his ver. 33 (cf. ver. 24, <span class="accented">infra</span>, note). <span class="accented">The light of the body</span>; <span class="accented">the lamp</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>, note). The thought of the power which treasure has of attracting the heart forms the transition to the need of a pure and steady "eye" heavenwards. The bodily eye is taken as the symbol of the outlooking power of the soul, not the soul - the inner man - itself, but its outlooking power. As the body is illuminated by the eye, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as by the eye the bodily constitution learns its environment, and naturally, almost automatically, tends to accommodate itself to it, so is it with the gaze of the soul. If this be upon the things of this world, the soul perceives, and tends to accommodate itself to the things of this world; if upon things in heaven, it perceives, and tends to accommodate itself to, the things in heaven. The Authorized Version "light" is, therefore, imperfect, for the gaze of the soul is not "light" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>), but a "lamp" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). As the bodily eye is not itself light, but only an instrument for receiving and imparting light, so in the mere gaze of the soul there is no inherent light, but it is the means of receiving and imparting light to the soul. <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore thine eye be single.</span> The word "single" (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) presents some difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If it meant "undivided," it would doubtless continue the illustration of the lamp, with an undivided as contrasted with a divided wick, but it has no such meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It states the opposite, not to divisions, but to folds (<span class="accented">vide</span> Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 56.); it is "single" as opposed to "plicate," and therefore can hardly contain any direct reference to the lamp. Its meaning rather appears to be purely metaphorical, and the word seems to be applied 'directly to the functions of the eye in relation to the body. If the eye be "single" and (to use another but related metaphor) straightforward in its working, then the body receives through it the light that it ought to receive. So is it with the gaze of the soul in its effect on the inner man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Perhaps, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x3b7;</span> is here used in the sense of non-compound (cf. Plato, 'Rep.,' 547. E); in this case free from any foreign substance to bar the light from passing through it (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-3.htm">Matthew 7:3</a>, and Basil, 'De Spiritu Sancto,' 9. &sect; 23, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy whole body shall be full of light</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

The word chosen seems to indicate, not merely that the body is, through the eye, lighted, but also that it itself becomes in measure, like the eye, full of light for others. All one's powers become illumined with the Divine light, and the illumination shines through. <span class="cmt_word">But if thine eye be evil</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); ver. 13, note. Vitiated, worthless. As an eye that does not fulfil its natural function, so is that gaze  of the soul which is directed only earthward. To limit tiffs, with Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.'), to covetousness (cf. also Hatch, 'Essays,' p. 81), is far too partial an interpretation. Such an earthward and selfish gaze of the soul may often issue in selfishness as regards money (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>), but the full meaning of the phrase includes very much more. <span class="cmt_word">Thy whole body shall be full of darkness</span>. What the heart craves to see it sees; but in this case, not light makes its entrance, but darkness, which, as in the case of the light, permeates the frame. <span class="cmt_word">If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is darkness</span>; the change here to the indicative (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>) indicating that the last preceding clause is assumed as fact. <span class="accented">The light that is in thee.</span> Our Lord does not say, "the light that comes through the eye," for he means more than this, viz. that the very information, so to speak, brought first by the outlook of the soul, comes into us and remains in us. He assumes that this, which ought to be light, is darkness. <span class="cmt_word">How great is that darkness!</span> <span class="accented">i.e. the darkness</span> (Revised Version)just spoken of, which comes through the eye. So, probably, <a href="../../par/luke/11-35.htm">Luke 11:35</a>. If' the gaze which should bring light brings only darkness, how terrible in its nature and effects must that darkness be! It is, however, possible to understand our Lord to refer in this verse to the natural darkness of the soul before it looks out of itself. In this case the thought is - you need a fixed gaze heavenwards; if your gaze is not heavenwards, it brings darkness instead of light; how black, then, must be the natural darkness! (cf. especially Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). It will be noticed that in these verses darkness, though scientifically only negative - the absence of light  - is here represented as positive, because it is the symbol of sin and evil.

As the word "mammon" comes twice in that parable, but nowhere else in the New Testament, it is probable that its occurrence caused the insertion of this saying in that place (cf. ver. 22, note). <span class="accented">No man can serve two masters.</span> The thought is still of earnestness of purpose and singleness of heart. Our Lord here speaks of the impossibility of such divided service as he has been warning his disciples against attempting. No man can give due service to two masters. For, apart from the extent of the claim of each master - total bond-service (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) - thorough service of two masters is incompatible with the effects produced upon the servant himself. The result of service is to incline him towards the one master and against the other. Notice how our Lord continues his plan of setting forth the moral effect of modes of thought or action upon the agents themselves (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For either he will hate the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and love the other.</span> Because human nature is such that it must attach itself to one of two principles.

A repetition of the statement of the impossibility of serving two masters, but more than a repetition, for it is enforced by defining who the masters are. <span class="accented">Mammon.</span> The change in the Revised Version from a capital to a small <span class="accented">m</span> has probably been made to prevent "mammon" being understood as the proper name of some god. The derivation of the word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span>) is very doubtful. The most probable suggestion is that it is formed from the stem of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, and is equivalent to that which is apportioned or counted (cf. Levy, 'Neuheb. Worterb.,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span>; Edersheim, 'Life,' 2. p. 269). Hence its well-known meaning of property, wealth, especially money. Observe that our Lord does not here contrast God and Satan; he is emphasizing the thought which he has been adducing since ver. 19, viz., the relation that his disciples must hold to things of earth, which are summed up by him under the term "mammon" as with us under the term "wealth." Observe also that it is not the possession of wealth that he condemns, but the serving it, making it an object of thought and pursuit. Gathering it and using it in the service of and according to the will of God is not serving mammon (cf. Weiss, 'Matthaus-Ev.').

It seems probable that in the differences Luke preserves the more original form (cf. the notes on the separate verses, <span class="accented">infra</span>). What their original position was is another question. Their immediate sequence in Luke to the parable of the rich fool is no doubt perfectly natural, and is accepted by most commentators as original; but the connexion with the context here is so close that, especially with the probabilities of the case in vers. 22, 23, and ver. 24, St. Matthew <span class="cmt_word"></span> may, after all, have recorded them in their original place. Our Lord says in these verses, "Dare to follow out this warning that I have given you about double service into your daily life. Do not give way to anxiety about the things of life, but look up to God in steady gaze of faith; he will provide." 'Or, more in detail - If God has given you life, shall he not add the food and the clothing (ver. 25)? Anxiety about the support of your life is needless (witness the birds, ver. 26) and powerless (witness the limit of a man's life, ver. 27); while as for clothing, it is equally needless (witness the flowers, ver. 28) and comparatively powerless (witness Solomon's own case, ver. 29). Remember your relation to God (ver. 30). Therefore do not give way to the least anxiety about these things (ver. 31), because this is to fall to the level of the Gentiles, and also because God, whose children you are, knows your needs (ver. 32). But make his cause, without and within, your great object, and all your needs shall be supplied (ver. 33). Therefore be not at all anxious, bear the burden of each day only as each day comes round (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>).

The translation of the Authorized Version, which was quite correct in its day (cf. also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>), is now archaic, and therefore often misunderstood. For the popular derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> ("division," "distraction"), cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, "But he that is married is anxious for (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;</span>) the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)."

Luke's is longer and seemingly more original. But in the absence of external evidence, it must always be a matter of opinion whether Matthew has compressed the longer form of the words, or <span class="accented">vice versa. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And why take ye thought for raiment?</span> In vers. 25-27 our Lord had spoken of food; in vers. 28-30 he speaks of dress. He insists on the needlessness (ver. 28) and on the comparative uselessness (ver. 29) of anxiety about it, since even the king who had the greatest opportunities could not vie in clothing with a single lily. Flowers have this glorious clothing (ver. 30), though they are so perishable: much more shall you be clothed. <span class="cmt_word">Consider</span> (ver. 26, note). <span class="cmt_word">The lilies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). Though there are many kinds of lilies in Palestine, and some of brilliant colouring (particularly the purple and white Huleh lily found round Nazareth), yet none of them grows in such abundance as to give the tone to the colouring of the flowers generally. It seems, therefore, probable that the word is employed loosely. So, perhaps, in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31, 33, 34</a>, and other passages, where it represents the "flowers" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>) on the candlestick. It appears, too, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> ("lily," Authorized Version in Canticles) is also used by the Arabs of any bright flower. If a single species is to be thought of, Canon Tristram would prefer the <span class="accented">Anemone coronaria</span> of our gardens, which is "the most gorgeously painted, the most conspicuous in spring, and the most universally spread of all the floral treasures of the Holy Land" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 464, edit. 1877). <span class="cmt_word">Of the field</span>. Matthew only in this phrase (but cf. ver. 30, note). Its insertion emphasizes the spontaneity of origin, the absence of cultivation, the "waste" as not grown for the comfort or pleasure of man. <span class="cmt_word">How they grow</span>. Professor Drummond's beautiful remarks upon this verse ('Natural Law,' etc.) do not belong to exegesis, but to homily, for the stress of our Lord's words lies on "grow," not on "how;" he is thinking of the fact, net the manner of their growth. They toil not; to produce the raw material. <span class="cmt_word">Neither do they spin</span>; to manufacture it when produced. "Illud virorum est, qui agrum colunt; hoc mulie-rum domisedarum" (Wetstein).

Luke's conclusion to this section ("Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom") is perhaps more closely connected with the preceding verse, and also grander as dwelling upon God's side; but Matthew's is more practical, dealing with the subject from man's side. Christ says, "Because all needful things shall be added, do not have one anxious thought for the future, even for what is coming on the very next day." Such anxiety shows a want of common sense, for each day brings its own burden of anxiety for itself. Christ here seems to allow anxiety for each day <span class="accented">as it comes round.</span> "But," he says, "put off your to-morrow's anxiety until to-morrow." If this be done, the greater part of all our anxiety is put aside at once, and, for the rest of it, the principle will apply to each hour as well as to each day (cf. Bengel).

Bab., 'Erach.,' 16<span class="accented">b</span>, "Out of thy teeth" seems to be the right reading. In these verses the "eye" is usually taken as belonging solely to the illustration, and as not itself representing any one object. It may be so, but it has been used so recently (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>) of the spiritual sense that it is more natural to take it so here. In this case the thought of the passage is of faults existing in a man's spiritual sense hindering his spiritual vision. The censorious man sees any fault, however small, readily enough in others, but does not see the much greater fault which he himself as a matter of fact has - his own censoriousness. This censoriousness is not a slight, but a great hindrance to his own spiritual vision, much more to his being of use in removing hindrances from the eye of another. <span class="accented">The mote</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Latt. <span class="accented">festucam</span>; any small vegetable body. The English word is from the Anglo-Saxon <span class="accented">mot</span>, "a small particle" (cf. further <a href="../../par/luke/6-41.htm">Luke 6:41</a>, note). Observe that our Lord allows that there is something wrong with the brother's spiritual vision, just as he allows that the unmerciful servant had a real debt owing to him. <span class="cmt_word">That is in thy brother's eye</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, note). Our Lord is here speaking of the relation of believers to fellow-believers.

The order of the Greek lays still more emphasis on the fact that, though in thy very own eye there is a beam, thou payest no regard to that (cf. ver. 5, note).

The verse seems to imply that if the spirit of censoriousness be absent, it will be possible for us to remove "motes" from the eyes of our brothers. Thus the passage as a whole does not say that we never ought to try to remove such "motes," but that this is monstrous and almost impossible so long as we ourselves have a fault of so much magnitude as censoriousness.

Theodoret (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 103, 168), in quoting this verse, adds, "My mysteries are tot me and mine," which, clearly an adaptation of Symmachus and Theodotion's rendering of <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. also Targ.

It seems probable that, as with the Lord's Prayer (ch. 6:9-13, note), so with these verses, the original position is given in Luke; yet, as also with the Lord's Prayer, Matthew's form of the individual clauses may be the more original (cf. ver. 11, note).

When, therefore, heathen sages or poets proclaimed any part of this, they had not thereby anticipated Christ; they had only deciphered some fragment of that law, which he gave from the first, and which, when men, exiles and fugitives from themselves and from the knowledge of their own hearts, had lost the power of reading, he came in the flesh to read to them anew, and to bring out the well-nigh obliterated  characters afresh."

So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin has, "some ancient authorities omit <span class="accented">is the gate."</span> (For a full discussion on the difficult question of the genuineness of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> here, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.') Westcott and Hort omit it, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, Old Latin, and many Greek and Latin Fathers, and say that, though <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> is probably genuine in ver. 14, "till the latter part of the fourth century the first <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span> has no Greek or Latin patristic evidence in its favour, much against it." They think this is "one of those rare readings in which the true text has been preserved by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> without extant uncial support...  . It was natural to scribes to set ver. 13 in precisely antithetic contrast to ver. 14; but the sense gains in force if there is no mention of two gates, and if the contrast in ver. 13 is between the narrow gate and the broad and spacious way." There must be a definite entering upon the right way; no entrance upon the wrong way is necessary, men find themselves upon it only too easily, and it is "made level with stones" (Ecclus. 21:10). <span class="cmt_word">Wide...  broad</span>. The second epithet (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) lays stress on there being plenty of space to walk in (Latt., <span class="accented">spatiosa</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That</span> <span class="cmt_word">leadeth to destruction</span> (<span class="greek_word">ei) th\n a)pw/leian</span>); that "perishing" in which "the sons of perishing" perish (<a href="../../par/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many there be which</span>; Revised Version, more exactly, <span class="accented">and many be they that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>).

He has throughout been insisting upon obedience to the Law in its final meaning as essentially necessary for his followers (most recently ver. 12). So that instead of saying, "ye that work sin," he uses the correlative (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>), for sin is neglect of or opposition to the perfect Law of God in the three spheres that this regards - self, the world, God (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It is, perhaps, more than a coincidence that in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a> we have again the collocation of the Lord knowing and of man's <span class="accented">departing</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either from him or from sin (cf. especially the parallel <a href="../../par/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>); <span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 207. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-16</a>). A solemn close to the sermon. By the similitude of two builders our Lord warns his followers that to have heard his words will have been useless unless they put them into practice. Observe that although the word "<span class="accented">hear</span> in these verses cannot indicate that full "<span class="accented">hearing"</span> which it sometimes connotes (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>), yet it seems to mean more than merely listening, and to imply both a grasp of what is intended by the statements made and at least some acquiescence in their truth (<a href="../../par/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). According to the above explanation, it will be seen that in the imagery the rock represents practice; the sand, mere sentiment. There is thus a partial correspondence with the works insisted on by St. James in contrast to a bare orthodox faith (<a href="../../par/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a>). Assent is insufficient; there must be action. Not uncommonly, indeed, the rock is considered to refer to the Lord himself, and the sand to human effort. Cf. Ford: "The parallel passage (<a href="../../par/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>), where the words, 'cometh unto Me,' are inserted, indicates clearly the foundation of <span class="accented">faith</span>, the receiving the Lord Jesus as our Prophet, Priest, and King, which is the only basis on which <span class="accented">good</span> works can be built" (cf. even Allord). This, however, is hardly exegesis, but application, for the "coming to Christ" is in Luke only introductory to the hearing and doing, and is altogether omitted here. Although the statement is true in itself, it is only so far proper to this passage in that, apart from practice, there is (ver. 23) no heart-union with Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Therefore whosoever hoareth; Revised Version, <span class="accented">every one therefore which heareth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> , <a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). The relative used lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the quality implied in the verb: every one who is of the kind that <span class="accented">hears</span> (contrast ver. 26). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">words</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mine, and doeth them</span>.

In the Plain of Sharon the clay seems to have been so interior that not only were the jars made of it often worthless, but the bricks could offer so little resistance to the weather that the houses were hardly safe. Hence a special prayer was offered by the high priest on the Day of Atonement that the Lord would grant that their houses might not become their tombs (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Yoma,' 5:2 [Schwab, p. 218]; cf. Neubauer, 'Geograph.,' p. 48). In the parable, however, it is not the structure, but the foundation, that is wrong. <span class="accented">The sand</span> may refer, as Stanley suggests ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 13. p. 430), to one locality, in which case it is probably "the long sandy strip of land which bounds the eastern plain of Acre, and through which the Kishon flows into the sea;" or, as would seem more probable, to the sand which would naturally be found on the edges of such a torrent as is here described. <span class="accented">Beat upon</span>; <span class="accented">smote upon</span> (Revised Version). In ver. 25 the thought is more of the swoop of the tempest (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); here, of its impact on the house (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It is possible that there is here less indication of force necessary for the destruction. "It needed  only the first blow, and the house fell" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.'). <span class="accented">And great was the fall of it.</span> Our Lord's solemn verdict of the utter ruin awaiting him who does not put his assent into action. The clause conveys an impression even stronger than ver. 23. There the positive worker of lawlessness is banished from Christ's presence; here, on the mere non-worker of Divine messages received is pronounced ruin and (for such, at least, seems suggested) that irremediable.

We return in this section to matter which resembles that of Mark and Luke, and undoubtedly belongs to the Framework (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction). St. Matthew has given a lengthy summary of the teaching of the Christ, and he now supplements it by a summary of his daily work. He is not concerned with the chronological connexion of the incidents here narrated, for this is evidently to him a matter of but secondary importance. He only desires to bring out different aspects of the Lord's life.

It carries on the thought of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in the last verse of the preceding chapter, and serves to introduce the following examples of sick folk; or, perhaps, it may be connected with the "great multitudes" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) of <a href="../../par/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>, coming, as the plural suggests (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>) from the various places there enumerated. If we must combine this verse with <a href="../../par/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>, we must suppose our Lord to have descended the mountain, and to be passing through "one of the cities," coming (our ver. 5) afterwards to Capernaum, the "great multitudes" (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>)being drawn from the various cities through which he passed. The verse reminds us that the two sides of the Lord's life, preaching and work, were intimately connected. Men not only wondered at what they heard (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), they also followed him, and this led to occasions for the exercise of his practical activity. The result was that they wondered at his work (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>), as they wondered at his preaching. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>.

From the parallel passages we may see that the word here refers more to the posture of his body than to the nature of his thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean</span>. Leprosy stood in so peculiar and solemn a relation to the Israelites that it would hardly be included under the terms, "all manner of disease, and all manner of sickness," in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23, 24</a>; we have therefore no evidence that up to this time any leper had been healed by our Lord. The man's utterance marks, therefore, a distinct advance in faith. None like him, the object of the Divine "stroke," had been healed; but from lesser examples of Jesus' power he argues to the greater. Sure of Jesus' power, he appeals to his heart. <span class="cmt_word">Make me clean</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

The careful record of the twofold action may be either a trace of the increasing astonishment of the bystanders or a means of indicating that this was no accidental touch, but the result of deliberate will (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>). According to the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a> with Leviticus 11:40), our Lord by this action would become unclean until the evening. But of this there is no hint. That indeed he could not by it contract any real impurity, or even any ceremonial impurity in the eyes of God, is self-evident. But how could he himself justify his exemption from the Law? and how could the people justify it? Probably both he and they felt that as "<span class="accented">the</span> priests, in their contact with the leper to be adjudged, were exempted from the law of defilement," much more was the One who "cleansed" him. "He says, <span class="accented">I will</span>,' to meet the heresy of Photinus.

Although a fair sense might be extracted by connecting this clause with. the words, "Moses commanded," it would, especially in the parallel passages, be a very awkward addition to them. Rather it must represent the man's "offering" in its ultimate purpose, and this not necessarily in the man's own mind. So more clearly the "Western" reading in the parallel passage in Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. Whether "them" refers to the priests or to the nation generally is not of grave importance, for the priests themselves, in act and feeling, represented the nation (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>, note). Of more interest is the question  - What is that which is here testified of? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Prima facie</span> the man's own state.

(never closely with the dative as here) seems to always refer to that which is both permanent and important (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). And in the New Testament with the dative it elsewhere refers either to work for the Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>) or to a solemn judgment (<a href="../../par/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>). So probably here. The man's offering is to be a permanent testimony to the nation of our Lord's relation to the Law. His miracles confirmed his profession (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some, however, accepting the above view in the main, translate, "for a testimony against them" (as <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>, and as perhaps <a href="../../par/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, but <span class="accented">vide</span> Plumptre there); but it is unlikely that so harsh a thought towards the nation would be expressed by our Lord at this early stage of his ministry. In <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a> there is a definite reason for its use. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-13.</span> <span class="accented">- The healing of the centurion's servant.</span> (Vers. 5-10; parallel passage <a href="../../par/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1-3, 6-10</a>. Vers. 11, 12, equivalent to <a href="../../par/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28, 29</a>.) According to St. Luke, the centurion sent first elders of the Jews to plead for him, and afterwards friends, and expressly said by them that he did not think himself worthy to come to Jesus. Their return in ver. 10 seems to forbid the supposition that he eventually came. This detailed narrative seems more likely than St. Matthew's, which is not only compressed, but, if taken by itself, gives a wrong idea of what appears to have actually taken place. But <span class="accented">quod tacit per alium facit per se</span>, and as Trench points out, this is "an exchange of persons, of which all historical narrative and all the language of our common life is full. A comparison of <a href="../../par/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a> with ch. 20:20 will furnish another example of the same." The fact is that St. Matthew (or, perhaps, the original framer of the source that he used, or those through whose hands it passed) seizes on the Gentilic origin of the centurion, without troubling himself to record his previous kind and generous attitude towards the Jews, and the interest that they now show on his behalf. This led to the omission of the second group of messengers also, and, of course, to the modification of the language where necessary, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 13. For the same reason, St. Matthew records vers. 11, 12 in this place. For the contrast between this and the superficially similar miracle recorded in <a href="../../par/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, cf.

The centurion says that he knows the power of a command when given by one in authority, through the obedience that he himself shows and through that which he himself receives.

St. Matthew in this verse calls attention to two points. First, that prophecy had foretold that Christ would heal the sick. For this he might have adduced <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>, and similar passages; but as one verse will serve his double purpose, he prefers it. Secondly, that the method by which Christ did this was specially noteworthy. He did not perform miracles by magic (as is commonly asserted of him in the Talmud; cf. Laible, 'Jesus Christ in Talmud,' p. 44: Berlin, 1891),nor by the power of God exerted as it were externally on his behalf, nor by his own inherent Divine power, but by himself bearing the sicknesses that he removed. He wrought his miracles at his own expense,and that expense the greatest. The thought is far-reaching, and implies both that he bore the ultimate cause of sickness, the sin of the world (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), and also that each miracle of healing meant for him a fresh realization of what bearing the sin of the world included. In other words, the passage in Isaiah, as interpreted by St. Matthew, refers, not only to the Passion as such, but also to Christ's suffering an earnest and a foretaste of it at each miracle. May not this have been in part the cause of his sigh at one miracle (<a href="../../par/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>), and his deep emotion at another (<a href="../../par/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>)? Observe that this may be the complementary side of his experience recorded in <a href="../../par/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a> (parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>), that "power" went out of him. A miracle of healing, though performed in momentary unconsciousness of what was taking place, still necessitated personal contact with sin, which to Christ's whole nature meant moral effort. The utterance recorded by Origen, "For those that are sick! was sick, and' for those that hunger I suffered hunger, and for those that thirst I suffered thirst" (Bishop Westcott, 'Introd.,' Appendix C; Resch, 'Agmpha,' Log. 47), probably expresses the same thought as our verse, though in the language of <a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35, 36</a>. A similar idea seems to underlie the well-known saying of Talm. Bab., 'Sanh.,' 98b, with reference to Messiah, "The Leper of the house of Rabbi is his name; for it is said, 'Surely he hath berne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.'"

Matthew is much less detailed. Matthew mentions two demoniacs; the parallel passages, one; the reason may be either that one was less fierce than the other, or that only one came from Gerasa (Nosgen). But in our present knowledge of the extent of inspiration, we cannot confidently affirm that the evangelists were kept from errors in numbers, and that the addition of the second demoniac is not due' to some misunderstanding, perhaps of the use of the plural in the demoniac's answer in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a> (cf. Weiss, 'Marcus-ev.,' p. 172). (For a similar difficulty, cf. the note on Matthew 9:27-31.) With regard to this mysterious narrative generally, the explanation of its details can be little more than empirical in our present knowledge of psychology and of spiritual influences. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Gergesenes;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">Gadarenes</span>, which is certainly right here, as is "Gerasenes" in the parallel passages (cf. Westcott and Hort, it. 'App.'). Gergesa (Textus Receptus here, and Alexandrian authorities in parallel passages) and Gerasa (unless, with Origen on <a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>, we understand by this the Arabian Gerasa fifty miles away)are probably forms of the same name now represented by <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, a village discovered (? in 1857) by Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 375, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, edit. 1880) on the eastern side of the lake, and lying "within a few rods of the shore," with "an immense mountain" rising directly above it, "in which are ancient tombs, out of some of which the two men possessed of the devils may have issued to meet Jesus. The lake is so near the base of the mountain that the swine, rushing madly down it, could not stop, but would be hurried on into the water and drowned." To this Origen's  description (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) corresponds: "Gergesa, to which the Gergesenes belong, is an ancient city by what is now called the Lake of Tiberias, by which is a steep place adjacent to the lake, and down this, as is pointed out, the swine were cast headlong by the demons." Gadara, in some sense the capital of Peraea (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:07. 3), and one of the towns of the Decapolis confederacy (ch. 4:25), was some twelve miles distant from <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, and six miles from the nearest part of the lake, to which, in fact (as the stamp of a ship on its coins shows), its territory extended (cf. Schiirer, II. 1. p. 100, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). St. Matthew describes the locality, not by the little-known village, but by the well-known city of the district, to which (as we may gather from the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>) the news of the miracle afterwards spread. But since he leaves the expression, "the city," in vers. 33, 34 as he fontal it in his sources, <span class="accented">i.e. Khersa</span>, the result is at first misleading <span class="cmt_word">There met him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">occurrerunt</span>, Vulgate). St. Matthew (contrast vers. 2, 5, 19) omits the nearer approach recorded in the parallel passages, <a href="../../par/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Two</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Possessed with devils</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">coming out of the tombs;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">coming forth out.</span> The Greek shows that they did not merely come from among the tombs, but actually out of them (cf. the experience of Warburton, as quoted in Trench on this miracle).

With the ungranted request of the man to remain with Jesus, and his subsequent preaching to these Gerasenes and others (parallel passages), St. Matthew does not concern himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/matthew/9.htm"><title>Matthew 9 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/matthew/9.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/matthew/9.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/matthew/9-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../matthew/8.htm" title="Matthew 8">&#9668;</a> Matthew 9 <a href="../matthew/10.htm" title="Matthew 10">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a></div><div class="verse">And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">paralytic forgiven and healed.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/2-1.htm">Mark 2:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-17.htm">Luke 5:17-26</a>.

Bengel's remark, "<span class="accented">Offerebant -</span> Tales oblationes factae sunt Salvatori plurimae, gratae," though very beautiful, is, from its undue insistence on the sacrificial use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, hardly exegesis. Matthew omits the difficulty that was experienced in bringing him to our Lord (see parallel passages), yet this alone accounts for the special commendation of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">A man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed.</span> Probably a mat or quilt (ver. 6). Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span> for March, 1891, p. 215, has a most interesting note showing that the differences between "lying on a bed" (Matthew)and "carried by four" (Mark), and even "they sought to bring him in, and to place him before him" (Luke, who has already mentioned "on a bed" ), may be explained by being different translations of an original Aramaic sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus seeing their faith</span>. Including that of the paralytic, who, as we may gather from the obedience he afterwards shows, had agreed to and had encouraged the special efforts of his bearers. <span class="cmt_word">Said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,</span> <span class="cmt_word">be of good cheer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Son.</span> So Mark, but Luke has "man" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>), which, though more usual in Greek (though still Hebraic, for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> would have been in accordance with classical usage), is much more colourless. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as a term of address, is elsewhere in the New Testament used only where there is relationship physical (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-31.htm">Luke 15:31</a>; even Luke 16:25) or moral, especially that of pupil and teacher (<a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; cf <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>). It therefore implies that there is both sympathy and much common ground between the speaker and him whom he addresses. It is the antithesis of <a href="../../par/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> (cf. further, <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 22). Thus it here served affectionately to encourage the sufferer in soul and body, preparing him to receive the announcement following. Matthew emphasizes its purpose by prefixing <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sins be</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">are</span>; expressing clearly that the words are the statement of a fact, not merely the expression of a command.  <span class="cmt_word">Forgiven thee</span>; Revised Version omits "thee" (genuine in Luke), with <span class="accented">manuscripts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Matthew and Mark use the present of general statement, Luke the perfect (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Doric; Winer, 14:3. a), to express a past fact of permanent significance. Observe the order of the Lord's assurance, as recorded in the true text. Courage, sympathy, forgiveness, and, only after all else, recalling individual sins. As the assurance of forgiveness is delightful to the soul, so is it often helpful to the body. Hence possibly our Lord's method in this case, for the man "inter spem metumque dubius pendebat" (Wetstein). Compare for the conjunction of the two, <a href="../../par/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>, and, as a still closer parallel to our passage, Talm. Bab., 'Nedarim,' 41<span class="accented">a</span>. "R. Hija bar Abba said, The sick doth not recover from his sickness until all his sins be forgiven him, for it is said, 'Who pardoneth all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.'" So also Qimbi (on <a href="../../par/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>, "Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee" ): "He does not say, Heal my body," for it is his sins that are the cause of his sickness, but if God heal his soul from its sickness, viz. by making atonement for his sins, then his body is healed."

Further, if, as seems likely,. the phrase was understood to symbolize the nation, he desired them to see in himself the great means whereby the nation should rise to its ideal. If, as is possible, though hardly probable, this saying of our Lord's is chronologically earlier than <a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and there,-fore the earliest occasion on which he used the phrase, the almost direct reference to <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> makes it the more interesting. <span class="cmt_word">(Then saith he to the sick of the palsy). </span> The thought of the sentence is continued, but as he now turns directly to the sick man, its form is altered. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, take up</span>.

All three evangelists connect this with the preceding miracle, but in the parallel passages the name is given as" Levi," St. Mark adding, "the <span class="accented">son</span> of Alphaeus." If the First Gospel were not written, in either Greek or Aramaic, by St. Matthew himself, but by a catechist of the Matthean cycle (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, pp. 6, 17.), it is possible that "Levi," as found in the source, may have seemed to the catechist disrespectful, and that he altered it to the title by which he had been accustomed to hear his master called. If, on the other hand, and as seems more probable, this Gospel was written by St. Matthew, his preference for "Matthew" rather than "<span class="accented">Levi"</span> may be due to its meaning (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.). <span class="cmt_word">And as Jesus passed forth</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from thence</span>. <a href="../../par/mark/2-13.htm">Mark 2:13</a> says that our Lord went out along the seaside, where "the receipt of custom" (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) would naturally be. <span class="cmt_word">He saw a man, named</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">called</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Matthew</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 20.). In the Greek "a man" is closely joined to "sitting at the receipt of custom," the words <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> appearing to be almost an afterthought. Not the name, but the man's occupation, was the important thing. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting</span>. Still plying his irreligious trade. <span class="cmt_word">At the receipt of custom</span>; <span class="accented">at the place of toll</span> (Revised Version). Perhaps a mere booth by the roadside for collecting the <span class="accented">octroi-duty</span> on food, etc., carried past. At the present day in Palestine" a booth of branches, or a more substantial hut, is erected at every entrance into the city or village, and there, both day and night, sits a man at ' the receipt of custom.' He taxes all the produce, piercing with a long, sharp iron rod the large camel-bags of wheat or cotton, in order to discover concealed copper wire, or other contraband" (Van Lennep, in Exell, <span class="accented">in lot.</span>). Schurer (1. 2. p, 67) shows that the customs raised at Capernaum in the time of Christ undoubtedly went, not into the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus</span>, but into the treasury of Herod Antipas. On the other band, in Judaea at that time the customs were raised in the interests of the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus.</span> (On "publicans" generally, see ch. 5:46, note; and for further details, Edersheim, 'Life,' 1. 515.) <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Follow me</span>. No promise is given corresponding to that in ch. 4:19. <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and followed him.</span> Perhaps the day's work was just over, or he may have left some assistant there.

This is, therefore, the first time that Matthew speaks of them as coming into direct contact with Jesus. Although Mark (cf. Luke) says that the objection was raised by those among the Pharisees who were also scribes (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), yet the difference of expression from that in ver. 3 must not be overlooked. There the fact that they were scribes, accustomed to weigh the statements of the Law about blasphemy, etc., was prominent in the mind of the narrator; here it is rather the fact that they were Pharisees, men who by their very name professed to hold aloof from those who neglected the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Saw it</span>. They could freely come into the court of the house, and when there could both see and hear what was passing in the rooms that opened into it. <span class="cmt_word">They</span> said; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">dieebaat</span> (Vulgate); "were saying." Their eager talk is brought vividly before us. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">his disciples.</span> Probably these were nearer to the Pharisees than Jesus himself was, or perhaps the Pharisees thought it easier to attack Jesus through them.

But the reason for this action (<span class="accented">why</span>, cf. also ver. 14) they did not understand. It is possible that the order of the Greek points to irony on the part of the Pharisees. The man who presumes to be called <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, and whom the disciples accept as such, sets at defiance the primary rules of right and wrong. Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 4. p. 222) explains the variants "teacher" (here) and "drink" (parallel passages) by the original Aramaic word for "drink" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) having been written here with the peculiar spelling of the Samaritan Targum (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">publicans and sinners?</span> Who form but one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">But go ye and learn what <i>that</i> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The first half of the verse comes in Matthew only<span class="cmt_word">.

In the original connexion of this quotation (<a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>) the words are without doubt (but cf. Dr. Taylor's 'Gospel in the Law,' p. 10) an expression of God's desire that his people should show mercy rather than only perform external sacrifices, and this meaning is probably intended by our Lord here also. The connexion will then be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">I</span> wish you to show mercy rather than perform external actions, for only thus will you resemble me in my coming to call sinners;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I wish you to show this mercy, and therefore I practise it myself." The former seems the more natural. It is, however, possible that our Lord disregards the original context of the words, and uses them only as a summary of an important truth, that God prefers to show mercy rather than to insist on sacrifice. This would make excellent sense here, viz. "Learn the true principle by which God acts, free grace, for it is on this that I have acted in coming to call sinners." (So nearly Dr. Taylor, op. c<span class="accented">it.</span>, p. 3.) The sentence is quoted again in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>, where the original thought of the words seems more certainly applicable. <span class="cmt_word">For I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am not come;</span> <span class="accented">for I came not</span> (Revised Version).

The English generic article in the first term spoils the anarthrous expression of the Greek by lessening the contrast between the two classes.

Observe that of the three accounts St. Matthew's points out the most clearly that the objection originated with the disciples of John the Baptist. Perhaps St. Matthew found these possessing special influence in the part for which his Gospel was primarily intended. So also St. John thought it desirable to recall the teaching of the Master, that while he himself was the Bridegroom, the Baptist was only subordinate (<a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>).

In the 'Didache,' &sect; 8, we have the earliest formal recognition or' it as a practice. It is there forbidden to fast on the same days as the Pharisees. Observe that this verse was understood in Tertullian's time as expressly commanding a fast during the forty hours in which our Lord was in the grave ('De Jejun.,' &sect; 2), and that, from Irenseus's expression in Eusebius ('Ch.

From a consideration of these details, the conclusion seems inevitable that we have, in fact, narratives of two distinct occurrences, but it is quite consistent with tiffs conclusion to suppose that during the oral transmission of the narratives a certain amount of assimilation took place. Upon this supposition, it further appears probable that, as the narrative in ch. 20. was the better known, for it was in the Petrine cycle, our narrative became assimilated to it rather than the reverse. On the other hand, the number recorded in ch. 20. (not Mark or Luke) looks much like an assimilation to that of our incident (cf. the notes on the section <a href="../../par/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28-34</a>, ver. 31, and the section vers. 32-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus departed thence.</span> As he was passing along on his way <span class="accented">thence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the house of Jairus, if the context be pressed.

"They brought to him one possessed with a devil, dumb, and the [dumb spake]. And the multitudes [said.]... But the Pharisees, He casteth out the devils by... the prince of the devils." One explanation is that the two narratives are taken kern different sources, but represent the same incident; another, that as in vers. 27-31, so also here, the narratives of two similar incidents have become assimilated. At any rate, in the case of ver. 34 there has probably been assimilation, and that since the writing of the Gospel. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ver. 34 is wanting in D, the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">k</span>, Hilary and Juvencns, and is therefore rightly bracketed by Westcott and Hort as perhaps "<span class="accented">a</span> Western non-interpolation" (2. &sect; 240). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The verse seems to be hardly in complete accordance with the aim of the whole section, which ends much more suitably with the effect on the multitudes. In <a href="../../par/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> the verse forms a climax (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2, 10, 14</a>). But here there has been no opposition mentioned since the very beginning of the chapter (for the disobedience of the blind men cannot be so called), so that the monstrous accusation comes in quite unexpectedly. Observe that this is not a case in which subjective difficulties are in themselves a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> argument for the genuineness of a phrase, for the early copyists troubled themselves very little about questions of the internal arrangement and the general aim of the sections. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">-</span> (<span class="accented">And</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">as they went out</span> (<span class="accented">forth</span>, Revised Version; ver. 31).

If the verse be genuine here, the thought, of course, is that the only effect of Christ's miracles upon the Pharisees was to drive them to open blasphemy and wanton opposition to the evidence of plain facts, as is brought out at length in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24-32</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils</span>; <span class="accented">by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils</span> (Revised Version); which indicates the true order of the words in the Greek. <span class="accented">Through.</span> The Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">in</span>, is more literal.

Its omission here and the alteration of the words," in all Galilee," to "all the cities and the villages," are both due to the wider scope of what follows. Observe that in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> our Lord's circuit is the occasion of crowds resorting to him, and serves as an introduction to a full account of his personal teaching, while here it is the occasion of his sending representatives, and serves as an introduction to his commission to them.

But while serving there as an introduction to the rest of the speech, the reason for it is so much more self-evident here that St. Matthew seems to have recorded it in its original connexion. Our Lord himself, feeling the shepherdless condition of the people, desires to call out the interest of his disciples in it. He wants them to realize both the need of the people and the possibility that lay before the workmen.
