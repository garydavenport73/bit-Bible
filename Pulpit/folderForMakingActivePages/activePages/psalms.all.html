The "Zion," on which he would "have mercy," was not the city only, but the people belonging to it. For the time to favour her (or, <span class="accented">pity her</span>), yea, the set time, is come. By "the set time" is probably meant the time fixed by Jeremiah for the termination of the Captivity and the restoration of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>), and alluded to by Daniel in <a href="../../par/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>.

(For the actual fact, see <a href="../../par/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-6.htm">Judges 3:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>, etc.)

When a nation sins, it is delivered over to its enemies, partly for punishment, partly to lead it to repentance. Israel was delivered into the hand, first, of Mesopotamia (<a href="../../par/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>), then of Moab (<a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), next of the Philistines (<a href="../../par/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), then of the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), later on of Midian (<a href="../../par/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>), still later of Ammon (<a href="../../par/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7-18</a>), and then of the Philistines once more (<a href="../../par/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>) - on each occasion because of some flagrant sins, and suffered chastisement until it repented. So we are told in Chronicles with respect to the invasions of Shishak (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-5</a>), of Pul (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25, 26</a>), of Tiglath-pileser (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19, 20</a>), and of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-17</a>), that they were on account of the people's transgressions.

Even the very nation which has been the most highly favored may, by misconduct, fall under his displeasure and suffer at his hands. Their population is diminished; they arc "bowed down" (Revised Version), or "brought low." Calamities of various kinds befall them.

Sometimes it is brought about by <span class="cmt_word">sorrow</span> - the death of a good ruler in the flower of his age, the extinction of a royal stock, the destruction of a nation's best and bravest on battle-fields, and the like.

But sometimes free vent is given to them (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fought against me without a cause</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-161.htm">Psalm 119:161</a>). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object.

It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that "no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are." Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-56</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thou a wicked man over him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> judge him (see ver. 7).

Why does God stand aloof? Why, after delivering his people from their foreign foes, does he not interfere to protect his true people from their domestic oppressors? "Throughout the reign of David," as it has been truly observed, "Palestine was infested by brigands, and disturbed by a factious nobility" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 191). <span class="cmt_word">Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</span> "Verily thou art a God that <span class="accented">hidest</span> thyself," says Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>).

He seems neither to see nor hear. The psalmist inquires - Why? It can only be answered, "In his wisdom; for his own purposes; because he knows it to be best."

Dr. Kay translates, "Through the pride of the wicked man the poor is set on fire;" and our Revisers, "In the pride of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued;" and so (nearly) the LXX., the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Kohler, Hengstenberg, and others. The Authorized Version paraphrases rather than translates; but it does not misrepresent the general sense, which is a complaint that the poor are persecuted by the wicked<span class="cmt_word">. Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>, "Let his net that he hath hid catch himself;" and <a href="../../par/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>, "Let the wicked fall into their own nets;" see also <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>: <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>). Some, however, translate, "They (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the poor) are ensnared in the devices which they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked) have imagined;" and this is certainly a possible rendering. Hengstenberg regards it as preferable to the other "on account of the parallelism and connection."

The construction is concise to abruptness, and it is hard to determine the ellipses. The passage in the original runs thus: "The wicked, in the height of his scorn - will not require - no God - all his thoughts.'  Of the various attempts to supply the ellipses, and obtain a satisfactory sense, the following (that of the 'Speaker's Commentary') is probably the best: "As for the wicked in the height of his scorn - 'God will not require' - 'There is no God' - such are all his thoughts." (Compare the Revised Version, which is not very different.) The general sense is that his pride conducts the wicked man to absolute atheism, or at least to practiced atheism (comp. vers. 11, 13).

The thoroughly wicked person who "neither fears God nor regards man," pursues the course which he has set himself, without deviation, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left. There is nothing to hinder him - no qualm of conscience, no distrust of himself, no fear of other men's opposition<span class="cmt_word">. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight</span>. They are held in reserve; he does not foresee them - he does not believe in them. <span class="cmt_word">As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them</span>.

The idea of continuance is instinctive in the human mind. "The thing that has been, it is that which shall be" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>). We expect the sun to rise each day, solely because in the past it has always risen (see Butler's 'Analogy,' part 1. ch. 1.). The wicked man, who has always prospered, expects to prosper in the future; he has no anticipation of coming change; he supposes that his "house will continue for ever, and his dwelling-place to all generations' (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>); he thinks that "to-morrow will be as to-day, and much more abundant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>).

These "lurking-places" must not be supposed to have been inside the villages, but outside of them They were retired spots at no great distance, where brigands or others might lie in ambush, ready to seize on such of the villagers as might show themselves. In the secret places doth he murder the innocent (comp. <a href="../../par/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>). The usual object would be, not murder, but robbery. Still, there would be cases where it would be convenient to remove a man, as Jezebel removed Naboth; and moreover, in every case of robbery, there is a chance that the victim may resist, and a struggle ensue, in which he may lose his life. His eyes are privily set against the poor; or, <span class="accented">his eyes lay ambush for the helpless</span> (Kay). The word translated" poor" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is only found in this place and in ver. 10, where the antithesis of "strong ones" seems to imply that the weak and helpless are meant.

' There is naught,' he says, 'but destiny, and that is blind; an absolute, and that has no eyes; an idea, and that has no grasp.'" He hideth his face. He looks away; he does not wish to be troubled or disturbed by what occurs on earth. So the Epicureans in later times.

At this point the psalmist passes from description to invocation. From ver. 2 to the end of ver. 11 he has described the conduct, the temper, and the very inmost thoughts of the wicked. Now he addresses himself to God - he summons God to arise to vengeance. As Hengetenberg says, "Here the second part begins - prayer, springing out of the lamentation which has preceded;" prayer and invocation, beginning here, and terminating at the close of ver. 15. O God, lift up thine hand; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to strike, to take vengeance on the wicked. Forget not the humble; or, the <span class="accented">afflicted.</span> Do not justify the hidden thought of the wicked (ver. 11),  that thou forgettest - show that thou rememberest at once the sufferings of the afflicted, and the guilt of their oppressors.

Others refer both words to the feelings of the oppressed, and translate, "travail and grief." <span class="cmt_word">To requite it with thy hand</span>. Again the Prayer-book Version is preferable, "to take the matter into thy hand," both for reward and requital. The poor committeth himself unto thee. He has no other possible refuge - therefore no other reliance. Thou art the Helper of the fatherless.

Bishop Butler has well shown how, in God's moral government of the world, virtue tends to accumulate to itself the good things of this life, and vice to disperse and dissipate them ('Analogy,' pt. 1. <a href="../../par/psalms/3.htm">Psalm 3</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his righteousness endureth forever</span>.

God's Word is "a lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their paths" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>) - sufficient under most circumstances to guide their steps aright.

It is a very forced interpretation to understand this as said of Jehovah. The entire subject of the psalm is the righteous, God-like <span class="accented">man</span>.

It makes him "show favor," or "kindness," to men generally, and "lend" to those who are in necessity (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>; and for the duty of lending to the needy, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-8.htm">Deuteronomy 15:8, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will guide his affairs with discretion</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">with equity</span>.

Almost a repetition of the phrase in ver. 7, "his heart is fixed" - seemingly, therefore, superfluous, but really emphasizing the point, which is of great moment (see the comment of Hengstenberg, and compare the "just man" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:3, 2. 1-8). <span class="cmt_word">He shall not be afraid</span>. "Perfect love casteth out fear" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). He who feels himself always and altogether in the hands of a loving Father cannot be afraid of what is about to befall him. <span class="cmt_word">Until he see his desire upon his enemies</span>.

There is no virtue in mere "dispersing," since spendthrifts" disperse" even more lavishly than virtuous men. The only laudable "dispersing" is that which has for its object the relief of distress, and which (it may be added) is wisely directed to that object. <span class="cmt_word">His righteousness endureth forever</span> (see the comment on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">His horn shall be exalted with honor</span>.

The wicked hate the righteous (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-25.htm">Psalm 105:25</a>), and are naturally "grieved" to see them prosper.

What return can the psalmist make? First, he will accept the blessing joyfully; next, he will ever continue to call upon God (ver. 13; comp. vers. 4, 17); thirdly, he will pay his vows openly in the temple, in the presence of the whole congregation (vers. 14, 18); fourthly, he will offer continually the sacrifice of thanksgiving (ver. 17) for the benefits vouchsafed him. The enumeration of his pious intentions is itself a song of praise to the Almighty. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me</span>? Natural piety suggests a return for favors received. What shall this be? the psalmist asks, and then proceeds to give the answer.

It has been usual to explain this of actual participation in the contents of a cup offered at a sacrificial meal, and then passed round to the worshippers. But there is no clear evidence of any such usage, except in connection with the Passover, which cannot here be in question. Hengstenberg there fore proposes to regard the phrase as a mere metaphor, like the "cup of trembling" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>), and understands the psalmist to mean that he will gladly and thankfully receive God's mercy vouchsafed to him, and thus show his gratitude for it. <span class="cmt_word">And call upon the Name of the Lord</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 17).

We are not told in Isaiah or 2 Kings that Hezekiah made any vows when he lay on his sick bed, but he may probably have done so. He certainly intended, as soon as his cure was complete, to "go up to the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a>).

"Tabernacles," or "tents," is continually used by the sacred writers as a synonym for "dwellings."

When God's right hand effects a deliverance, it gets, as it were, additional glory to itself. <span class="cmt_word">The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly</span>. So, already, in ver. 16.

This fresh elevation of Israel to importance - especially to such great importance - can only be attributed to the work of Divine providence.

Having received the priestly benediction, the processionists resume their strain. They have entered within the courts; they are approaching the altar of sacrifice; they have brought their offering. "Jehovah," they say, "is God, and hath given us light" (see the Revised Version). That is, he has enlightened our spirits to see and acknowledge his mercies; or, perhaps, he has led us, as he did the people, by a pillar of fire in the wilderness; and now we stand before the altar with our offering - <span class="cmt_word">receive it at our hands, ye priests-and bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</span> So shalt the act of thanksgiving be complete, and the solemn service ended.

A variant expression for keeping the Law, rather than the specification of a particular part of it. <span class="cmt_word">And that seek him with the whole heart</span>.

The "word" hid in the psalmist's heart (ver. 11) could not but rise to his lips on fit occasion, and be set forth before the people for their edification - more especially as there was an express command binding upon all Israelites to teach the Law to their children and dependants (see particularly <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>).

These last are in the writer's mind in the present verse - such judgments as those upon Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-31</a>), Zerah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), and Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-37</a>).

The superfluous "harps" were "hung" up upon the trees that grew by the watercourses. These are called "willows," or, according to some, "poplars," but were probably of a different species from any of the trees that grew in Palestine. The chief Babylonian tree was the palm, which grew in the greatest luxuriance along the courses of all the streams (Herod., 1:193; Atom Man., 24:3; Zosim., 3. pp. 173-179). Tamarisks, poplars, and acacias were also common, but true "willows" hardly appear to have ever been a product of the country. The '<span class="accented">arabah</span> of our author was probably either a poplar or a tamarisk.

The captives had, no doubt, spoken of the joyous strains which they had been wont to pour forth in their own city upon festive occasions.

It would be desecration to sing them "in a strange land," among strange people, not to call forth devotional sentiment, but to gratify curiosity.

The general resemblance to <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> is striking, but there are peculiar and original touches which indicate the author, not the copyist. For instance, the expression, "my goodness," occurs nowhere else. <span class="cmt_word">Who subdueth my people under me.</span> Another reading gives, "Who subdueth <span class="accented">peoples</span> under me." Either reading suits the circumstances of David, who had to subdue a great portion of his own people under him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-21</a>), and also conquered many foreign nations (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>).

The strain changes. From praise of God's loving-kindness and might, the psalmist proceeds to invoke his aid. Taking his metaphors from <a href="../../par/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>. "Bow thy heavens, O Lord," he says, "and come down" to earth - appear in thy might, to the discomfiture of thy enemies and the relief of thy faithful ones. <span class="cmt_word">Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke</span>. Do as thou wert pleased to do at Sinai, when thou showedst thyself - "Touch the mountains, and let a smoke go up from them" (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7-14</a>) - a consuming fire, that shall burn up the ungodly.

Another change of strain. The psalmist returns to his original theme of the praise of God (see vers. 1, 2), and promises a "new song," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee</span>; rather, upon <span class="accented">a psaltery of ten strings</span> (see the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>).

There has always been a belief, especially in the East, that "a divinity doth hedge a king." Saul himself was regarded by David as sacrosanct, and to kill him, even at his own request, was a sacrilege (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</span> David speaks of himself by name, not only here, but in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-26.htm">2 Samuel 7:26</a>.

The stanza which these words introduce is a very remarkable one, having nothing at all corresponding to it in the rest of the Psalter. It has been thought by some to be an antique document, quoted by the writer of the psalm, as suited for a festal occasion. Our translation makes it a picture of the condition to which the writer hopes that Israel may one day come; but the best recent critics see in it a description of Israel's actual condition in the writer's day. Professor Cheyne translates, "Because our sons <span class="accented">are</span> as plants;" and Dr. Kay, "What time our sons <span class="accented">are</span> as plants." <span class="cmt_word">Grown up in their youth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grown large</span>.

Even royal captives were thus treated in the ancient world. Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs always represent their captives, even when kings, as fettered. Nebuchadnezzar "bound Zedekiah with fetters of brass" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). Parthia, and later Persia, and even Rome, followed the same practice. And their nobles with fetters of iron. On the monuments, cap-fives below the rank of kings are not often seen "fettered." Their arms, however, are frequently tied together with a cord, and they are fastened one to another by a stout rope.

An atheism is here depicted which goes beyond even that of <a href="../../par/psalms/10.htm">Psalm 10</a>. There the existence of God was not so much denied as his providence. Here his existence is not only denied, but denied in the very depths of the man's heart. He has contrived to convince himself of what he so much wishes. The psalmist regards such a state of mind as indicative of that utter perversity and folly which is implied in the term <span class="accented">nabal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">They are</span>  <span class="cmt_word">corrupt</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they have corrupted themselves</span> (comp.

We have <span class="accented">no</span> right to say that this is always so; but the tendency of atheism to relax moral restraints is indisputable<span class="cmt_word">. They have done abominable works</span> (comp. vers. 3 and 4). <span class="cmt_word">There is none that doeth good</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> none <span class="accented">among them.</span> The psalmist does not intend his words to apply to the whole human race. He has in his mind a, " righteous generation" (ver. 5), "God's people" (ver. 4), whom he sets over against the wicked, both in this psalm and elsewhere universally (see <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, etc.).

Corruption having reached such a height as it had, God, is represented as looking down from heaven with a special object - to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. To see, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if among the crowd of the "abominable" doers spoken of in ver. 1 there were any of a better spirit, and possessed of understanding, and willing to seek after God.

The expression "denotes a general - all but universal-corruption" ('Speaker's Commentary'). They are all together become filthy; literally, <span class="accented">sour</span>, <span class="accented">rancid</span>  - like milk that has turned, or butter that has become bad. There is none that doeth good, no, not one. St. Paul's application of this passage (<a href="../../par/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>), to prove that "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (ver. 23), goes beyond the intention of the psalmist.

Can it be possible that none of these evil-doers is aware of the results of evil-doing? Do they think to escape Divine retribution? The "wonder expresses the magnitude of their folly" (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Who eat up my people as they eat bread</span>. Reducing men to poverty, robbing them, and devouring their substance, is called, in Scripture, devouring the men themselves (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>).

This might have seemed scarcely to need mention, since "how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?" (<a href="../../par/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>). But it connects them definitely with the atheists of ver. 1.

Such a walk involves the doing of righteousness, not, of course, in absolute perfection, but with a sincere intention, and so as to have "the answer of a good conscience towards God" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And speaketh the truth in his heart.</span> Not "<span class="accented">from</span> his heart," as in the Prayer-book Version, which would make the reference one to mere truth of speech, but "in his heart," which points to internal truthfulness - that truthfulness "in the hidden council-chamber of the soul," which "holds no parley with what is false" (Kay).

Among the negative virtues the first place is given to the observance of the ninth commandment, probably because to  err in this respect is so very common a fault (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor doeth evil to his neighbour;</span> rather, to <span class="accented">his friend</span>, or <span class="accented">his companion</span> - a different word from that used at the end of the verse, and implying greater intimacy. There is special wickedness in injuring one with whom we are intimate. <span class="cmt_word">Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour</span>. The good man does not, even when it is true, spread an ill report concerning his neighbour. He prefers to keep silence, and let the report die out (see <a href="../../par/exodus/33-1.htm">Exodus 33:1</a>).

So the LXX., the Vulgate, Ewald, Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version. Others prefer to translate, "He is despised in his own eyes, [and] worthless" (Abort Ezra, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Either rendering furnishes a good sense; but the law of parallelism is very decidedly in favour of the former. As the righteous man honors those who fear God, so he contemns those who are vile or worthless. He is no respecter of persons. Men's outward circumstances are nothing to him. He awards honour or contempt according to men's moral qualities. But he honoreth them that fear the Lord. "It is no common virtue," says Calvin, "to honour pious and godly men, since in the opinion of the world they are often as the offscouring of all things (1 Corinthans 4:13)? He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. The righteous man, if he happens to have sworn to do something which it turns out will be to his own hurt, nevertheless keeps his engagement (comp <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used in the same sense).

The ordinary Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, "thou hast said," requires the insertion of "O my soul," or something similar. But if we read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> with a large number of manuscripts, with the LXX., the Vulgate, the Syriac, and most other versions, no insertion will be necessary. The meaning will then be, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have said to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art my Lord</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">adonai</span> - "my Lord and Master." <span class="cmt_word">My goodness extendeth not to thee</span>.

The psalmist means to say that he has no happiness beside (or apart from) God. (So Ewald, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.)

This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would "hasten after" - or perhaps it should be translated "wed themselves to" - another god (see <a href="../../par/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect "prosperity," or joy of any kind. Their "sorrows will be multiplied;" distress and anguish will come upon them (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer.</span> Drink offerings of actual  blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor take up their names into my lips</span>. By "their names" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods. The Law forbade the mention of these names by Israelites (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>).

God had said to Aaron, when he gave him no special inheritance in Canaan, "I am thy Part and thine Inherit-ante among the children of Israel" (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>). David claims the same privilege. God is his "Portion," and he needs no other. <span class="cmt_word">And of my cup</span>. A man's "cup" is, in Scripture, his lot or condition in life (<a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>) - that which is given him to drink.

These had fallen to him "in pleasant places" - in Jerusalem and its near vicinity. Yea, I have a goodly heritage. Some explain "heritage" here by the "inheritance" of ver. 5. But the word used is different; and it is most natural to understand David's earthly heritage, or lot in life. This, he says, is "pleasing" or "delightsome" to him.

God has become David's "Counsellor" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>), makes suggestions to him which he follows, and so guides his life that he feels bound to praise and bless him for it. <span class="cmt_word">My reins also instruct me in the night seasons</span>. The reins, according to Hebrew ideas, are the seat of feeling and emotion. David is "instructed" or "stimulated" (Hengstenberg) to bless God by the feelings which stir within him as he lies awake at night - feelings, we must suppose, of affection and gratitude.

"Proved" means "tried," "tested," examined strictly, so as to know whether there was any wickedness in it or not. Thou hast visited me in the night. The night is the time when men can least escape those searching, testing thoughts which God's providence then especially sends, to "try the very heart and reins" (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast tried me., and shalt find nothing;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and findest nothing.</span> The process was one begun in the past, and continuing on in the present.

Having established, as the ground of his claim to be heard of God, his own sincerity, steadfastness, and virtuous course in life (vers. 3-5), David now recurs to his original intent, and resumes his "prayer."

When he so awakes, he says, he will he "satisfied with God's <span class="accented">likeness."</span> The word used is the same as that employed in <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, of the manifestation of the Divine glory to Moses - viz. <span class="accented">temunah.</span> David therefore expects to see, on awaking, a similar manifestation, he will have the enjoyment of the "beatific vision," if not in the Christian sense, at any rate in a true and real sense, and one that will wholly "satisfy" him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/18.htm"><title>Psalm 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/17.htm" title="Psalm 17">&#9668;</a> Psalm 18 <a href="../psalms/19.htm" title="Psalm 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i>that</i> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,>> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will love thee, O Lord, my</span> <span class="cmt_word">Strength.</span> This opening is very remarkable.

Here begins the narrative of David's sufferings in the past. "'The sorrows' - or rather, 'the cords' - of death," he says, "encompassed me," or "coiled around me" (Kay). Death is represented as a hunter, who goes out with nets and cords, encompassing his victims and driving them into the toils. David's recollection is probably of the time when he was "hunted upon the mountains" by Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>), and expected continually to be caught and put to death (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-15.htm">1 Samuel 23:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the floods of ungodlymen made me afraid</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the torrents of Belial</span>, or  <span class="accented">of ungodliness.</span> The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.

Death and Hell are, both of them, personified, and made to join in the chase. The ensnaring nets are drawn nearer and nearer; at last the toils close in, the last cast is made, and the prey is taken. <span class="cmt_word">The snares of death prevented me</span>; or, <span class="accented">came upon me</span> (Revised Version) - "took me by surprise" (Kay).

As HengstenBerg notes, "While the manifold distresses are united in the beginning of the verse into one great 'distress,' so the manifold Divine hearings and helps are united into a single grand hearing and help" - and, we may add, the manifold cries into one great cry. <span class="cmt_word">He heard my voice out of his temple;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his tabernacle, since the temple was not yet built (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>); or perhaps, "out of heaven "(Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And my cry came before him, even into his ears</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, where the same word is used for the "cry" of the children of Israel in Egypt).

The psalmist must not be understood literally. He does not mean that the deliverance came by earthquake, storm, and thunder, but describes the discomfiture and dismay of his opponents by a series of highly poetical images. In these he, no doubt, follows nature closely, and probably describes what he had seen, heard, and felt. <span class="cmt_word">The foundations also of the hills</span> <span class="cmt_word">moved and were shaken.</span> In violent earthquakes, the earth seems to rock to its foundations; mountain ranges are sometimes actually elevated to a height of several feet; rocks topple down; and occasionally there are earth-slips of enormous dimensions. <span class="cmt_word">Because he was wroth.</span> God's anger against the psalmist's enemies produced the entire disturbance which he is describing.

Emissions of smoke are a common feature of volcanic disturbances, with which earthquakes are closely connected.

The fire-balls above spoken of are declared to have scorched and burnt the workmen employed by Julian (Amm. Marc., 23. 1).

In a storm the clouds do actually descend, and the whole heaven seems to be bowed down to earth. God is said to "come down" to earth whenever he delivers the oppressed, and takes vengeance on their oppressors (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-10.htm">2 Samuel 22:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64.htm">Isaiah 64</a>. I, 3, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And darkness was under his feet.</span> A deep darkness commonly accompanies both earthquake and storm. When God actually descended on Mount Sinai, it was amid thunders and lightnings, and "a thick cloud" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>), elsewhere called "thick darkness" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly</span>. The imagery here transcends all experience, and scarcely admits of comment or explanation. God is represented as borne through the heavens, as he proceeds to execute his purposes, by the highest of his creatures, the cherubim. Elsewhere (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>) he sails through the sky supported on clouds. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he sped swiftly</span> (Kay). The verb used is different from that translated "did fly" in the preceding verse. It is applied elsewhere especially to the eagle (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>).

In executing his judgments he did not allow himself to be seen. God's action is always secret and inscrutable. <span class="cmt_word">His pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> The original runs as follows: "He made darkness his secret place - his pavilion round about him - dark waters, thick clouds of the skies." The whole forms one sentence, "his pavilion" being in apposition with "secret place," and the last clause, "dark waters, thick clouds of the skies," being exegetical of the "darkness" in the first clause. God's "pavilion," or "tent" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>), is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a> and Psalm 31:20.

The "thick clouds" are riven and parted asunder for the lightning to burst forth. Then come, almost simultaneously, hail stones and coals of fire; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hail like that which fell in Egypt before the Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-34</a>), when "there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail" (ver. 24) - a fire which "ran along upon the  ground," or some very unusual electrical phenomenon (see the comment on Exodus in the ' Homiletic Commentary,' p. 208).

Hail stones and coals of fire. The phrase is repeated for the sake of emphasis. The hail and the lightning are represented as conjointly the ministers of the Divine vengeance.

God's "arrows" are often spoken cf. Job felt them within him (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). David has already said of them, that they are "ordained against the persecutors" (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). We may understand by the expression any sharp pains, mental or bodily, which God sends<span class="cmt_word">.

Instead of" and he shot out lightnings," our Revisers give, <span class="accented">and lightnings manifold</span>, which is perhaps better.

He begins by summing up all in a word, "God <span class="accented">delighted</span> in him." He then goes on to explain the causes of God's "delight" (vers. 20-26).

It is observed that the word translated by "departed wickedly" implies "wilful and persistent wickedness" ('Speaker's Commentary') - "an entire alienation from God" (Calvin). Not even in the humblest of the penitential psalms, when David is bewailing his great offence, does he use this verb of himself. He is an example to all men not to indulge in a false humility, nor employ phrases concerning himself which go beyond the truth.

But what sin this was, we have no means of determining. All that appears is that David had an inclination to some particular form of sin, against which he found it necessary to be continually upon his guard.

The main principle is that God will act towards men as they act towards him.

The reason is well explained in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "In dealing with the good, God shows his approval by manifesting attributes similar or identical in essence; in dealing with the wicked, he exhibits attributes which are correlative - in just proportion to their acts," but not identical. God cannot "show himself froward" - he can only show himself opposed, antagonistic, an adversary. What the psalmist means to say is that, if men oppose and thwart God, he in return will oppose and thwart them. But they will act in a perverse spirit, he in a spirit of justice and righteousness.

The <span class="accented">fact</span> of "pride going before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall," was noticed by the heathen of the ancient world, no less than by the" peculiar people." And both alike attributed the downfall of the proud to God. "Seest thou," says Herodotus, "how God with his lightning smites always the bigger animals, and will not suffer them to wax insolent, while those of a lesser bulk chafe him not? How likewise his bolts ever fall on the highest houses and the tallest trees? So plainly does he love to bring down everything that exalts itself. Thus ofttimes a mighty host is discomfited by a few men, when God in his jealousy sends panic or storm from heaven, and they perish in a way unworthy of them. For <span class="accented">God</span> allows no one to have high thoughts but himself" (vii. 10, &sect; 5). But the heathen seem to have imagined that God envied the proud ones, and therefore cast them down.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <i>whom</i> I have not known shall serve me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast delivered me from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the strivings of the people.</span> David now approaches his conclusion. In one verse he at once sums up his past deliverances and anticipates fresh glories. God has delivered him from the strivings of those who were hostile to him among his own people (see vers. 4-18), and has also given him victory over the heathen. In the future he will do even more. <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast made me the head of the heathen</span>. The antithesis between "people" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) and "heathen," or "nations" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), is unmistakable. The long series of David's victories have made him "head" over the latter. This is less clearly seen in the history of David's reign than in the description given of the state of the kingdom inherited from David by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A people whom I have not known shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">serve me</span>. It is not clear that this was ever fulfilled literally in the person of David, and, we are entitled to explain it as a Messianic prophecy, parallel with that of <a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>.

The kingdom of the Redeemer at once attracts and alarms. So Isaiah says, "The nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted...  .

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46-50.</span> - This glorious and triumphant psalm concludes with a solemn ascription of praise, blessing, and thanksgiving to Almighty God - partly recapitulation of what has preceded (vers. 47, 48), partly additional (vers. 46, 49, 50). Terms of praise are accumulated, and the whole is made to culminate in a Messianic burst, where David is swallowed up in his "Seed;" and the "Anointed King" presented to our view is rather the antitype than the type - rather Christ Jesus than the son of Jesse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord liveth</span>. God was known to Israel as "the living God" from the time of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). The epithet exalted him above all other so-called gods, who were not living (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>). But it had also a very precious, absolute meaning. God's life was the source of man's. It was through God (who had life in himself) breathing into man the breath of life that man became a living soul (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Hence "the living God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>) is "the God of our life" (<a href="../../par/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And blessed be my Rock</span> (see vers. 1, 31). In blessing "his Rock," David blesses God for his qualities of firmness, steadfastness,  and trustworthiness. And let the God of my salvation be exalted. "The God of my salvation" is a favourite phrase with David (see <a href="../../par/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a>). Other writers use it rarely. When David prays that the God of his salvation (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who continually saves him and preserves him) may be "exalted," he probably desires that he may be praised and honoured of all men.

The "deliverance" was especially from domestic foes (see vers. 17, 19). His foreign foes seem never to have brought David into much peril. Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me. The "lifting up" was above enemies of both kinds (see ver. 43). Thou hast delivered me from the violent man (comp. ver. 17). There is no reason to doubt that in both places Saul is intended. He was at once David's "enemy," and a "man of violence." Were the question open otherwise, it would be closed by the statement in the title. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen</span>. As, in some sense, "the <span class="accented">head</span> of the heathen" (ver. 43), David was bound to offer prayer, and praise, and thanksgiving "among them," if it were only to teach them by his example, and lead them on towards the worship of the true God.

God had then "saluted" David as "his servant" (ver. 5), and sent him a message of the most gracious character, even promising the kingdom to him and to his seed "for ever" (vers. 13, 16). <span class="cmt_word">And showeth mercy to his anointed, to David</span>. No doubt David is primarily intended, both by the "king" of the first clause, and by the "anointed" of the second; but the combination of the two, and the immediate mention of the "seed" which is to reign "for ever," carry the passage beyond the psalmist individually, and give to the conclusion of the psalm, at any rate, a semi-Messianic character. As Hengstenberg says, "Psalms of this kind are distinguished from those which may more strictly be called Messianic, only by this - that in the latter the Messiah <span class="accented">exclusively</span> is brought into view, while here he is presented to our notice only as a member of the seed of David" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 324, Engl. trans.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/19.htm"><title>Psalm 19 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/19.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/19.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/19-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/18.htm" title="Psalm 18">&#9668;</a> Psalm 19 <a href="../psalms/20.htm" title="Psalm 20">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heavens declare the glory of God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the heavens are recounting the glory of God</span> - of El, "the Mighty One" - the God of nature (see <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).

(On "the firmament," see <a href="../../par/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6, 20</a>.) It is the entire atmosphere enveloping the earth, in which the clouds hang and the birds move.

It is much disputed what "their <span class="accented">line"</span> means. The word used, <span class="accented">qav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span>), means, ordinarily, a "measuring-line" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>: <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, etc.), whence it comes to have the further sense of a terminus or boundary; that which the measuring-line marks out. It is also thought to have signified an architect's rule; and, hence, anything regulative, as a decree, precept, or law (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>). The LXX. translated it in this place by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a musical sound;" and Dr. Kay supposes "the regulative chord," or "key-note." to be intended. Perhaps "decree" would be in this place the best rendering, since it would suit the "words" (<span class="accented">minim</span>) of the second clause. The "decree" of the heavens is one proclaiming the glory of God, and the duty of all men to worship him. <span class="cmt_word">And their words to the end of the world</span>. Though they have neither speech nor language, nor any articulate words, yet they have "words" in a certain sense. <span class="accented">Millim is</span> said to be used of thoughts just shaping themselves into language, but not yet uttered (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun</span>. God has made the heavens the sun's dwelling-place, the place where he passes the day. There is, perhaps, a tacit allusion to the Shechinah, which dwelt in the tabernacle of the congregation:

The sun's "chamber" is where he passes the night - below the earth; from this he bursts forth at morning in his full glory, scattering the darkness, and lighting up his splendid "tabernacle<span class="cmt_word">." And rejoiceth as a strong man-to run a race</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>, "As the sun when he goeth forth <span class="accented">in his might"</span>).

Some go so far as to say that there is no connection at all between the first and second parts of the psalm. But it is the law and order that pervades the material universe which constitutes its main glory; and the analogy between God's physical laws and his moral laws is evident, and generally admitted (see the great work of Bishop Butler, part 1.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Law of the Lord is perfect.</span> Whatsoever proceeds from God is perfect in its kind; his "Law" especially - the rule of life to his rational creatures. That salvation is not by the Law is not the fault of the Law, but of man, who cannot keep it. "The Law" itself "is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Converting</span> (rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">restoring</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the soul</span>.

The Law, by instructing men, restores them from moral blindness to the light which is theirs by nature (<a href="../../par/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>), and, as a further consequence, in many cases, restores them from sin to righteousness<span class="cmt_word">.

Hengstenberg explains "the fear of the Lord" in this place as "the instruction afforded by God for fearing him." And certainly, unless we adopt some such explanation, we shall find it difficult to account for the intrusion of the clause into its present position. The Law, the testimony, the statutes (or precepts), the commandment (vers. 7, 8), and the judgments (ver. 9), are external to man, objective; the fear of the Lord. as commonly understood, is internal, subjective, a "settled habit of his soul." It is not a thing of the same kind with the other five nominatives, and appears out of place among them. Hence it seems best, with Professor Alexander, to adopt Hengstenberg's explanation. The Law, viewed as teaching the fear of God, is undoubtedly "clean " - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pure, perfect - and "endures for ever," or is of perpetual obligation. <span class="cmt_word">The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether</span>. In "judgments" we have another of the recognized synonyms for the entire Law (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-7.htm">Psalm 119:7, 13, 43, 52, 62</a>), which is from first to last "exceeding righteous and true" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a>, Prayer-book Version).

This verse is a sort of connecting link between the second and the third parts of the psalm. Through its subject-matter, which is still the Law of the Lord, it belongs to the second part; but metrically, and by the introduction of the person of the psalmist ("thy servant"), it belongs to the third. David feels that to <span class="accented">him</span> it is the crowning excellency of the Law, that it teaches, instructs, or "warns" <span class="accented">him. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And in keeping of them there is great reward</span>. Not only the reward promised in <a href="../../par/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, or "the recompense of the reward" laid up for men in heaven, but a present reward "in the act of keeping them" (Kay).

Man "had not known sin but by the Law" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>), and he cannot contemplate the Law without being reminded of possible disobedience to it. The psalmist's thoughts are led in this direction, and he ends with an earnest prayer against "secret sins" (ver. 12), against "presumptuous sins" (ver. 13), and against sins of word and thought (ver. 14), addressed to "God his Strength [or, 'his Rock'] and his Redeemer." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who can understand his errors?</span> rather, <span class="accented">who can discern</span> (or, <span class="accented">perceive</span>) <span class="accented">his errors</span>? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all of them.

"The sanctuary" here is undoubtedly the holy place which David had established on Mount Zion, and in which he had placed the ark of the covenant. God's help was always regarded as coming especially from the place where he had "set his Name." In the original it is, "Send <span class="accented">thy</span> help" - the help thou needest and prayest for. <span class="cmt_word">And strengthen thee out of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">support thee.</span>

"The blessings of goodness" is pleonastic, since a blessing cannot be otherwise than a good. <span class="cmt_word">Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head</span>. It is remarked that David, as the result of one of his wars, did actually take the crown of the conquered king, which was a crown of gold, from off the king' s head, and place it upon his own head (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>); but this is scarcely what is intended here. As Hengstenberg observes, "The setting on of the crown marks the bestowment of dominion," not in one petty ease only, but generally, and is scarcely to be altogether separated from the promises recorded in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.

We must understand the psalmist to have asked for continuance <span class="accented">in his posterity</span>, and this was guaranteed him  in the message which God sent him by Nathan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13, 16</a>). In the full sense the promise was, of course, Messianic, being fulfilled only in Christ, the God-Man, who alone of David' s posterity "liveth for ever."

David' s glory exceeds that of all other living men, through the "salvation" which God vouchsafes him. That salvation is partly temporal, consisting in deliverance from his foes; partly of an unearthly and spiritual character, arising out of his relationship to the coming Messiah. It is from the latter point of view, rather than the former, that it is said, <span class="cmt_word">Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast made him most blessed for</span> <span class="cmt_word">ever;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for thou settest him to be blessings for ever.</span> Thou makest him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to be a perennial source of blessings to men.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/21-7.htm">Psalm 21:7</a></div><div class="verse">For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the king trusteth in the Lord</span>. This is at once the ground and the result of God' s favour to him. God favours David because of his trust, and David trusts in God because of his favour. The result is that, through the mercy (or, <span class="accented">loving-kindness</span>, Revised Version) of the <span class="cmt_word">Most High he shall not be moved</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>). The words appear to denote a conviction, as Professor Alexander says, that David "would never be shaken from his standing in God' s favour." This conviction we may well conceive him to have felt, and to have regarded as one that might fittingly be expressed by his subjects, in whose mouth he placed it. But such a conviction is not always borne out by events, and David confesses elsewhere, that, at any rate, once in his life, after he had said, "I shall never be moved," God "hid away his face from him," and he "was troubled" (<a href="../../par/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6, 7</a>).

"Having shown what God would do for his anointed, the psalm now describes what the latter shall accomplish through Divine assistance" (Alexander). Past success is taken as a guarantee of victory over all other enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "shall reach them, attain them, punish them" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger</span>. Some suppose a reference to the event mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, "He (David) made them (the Ammonites) to pass through the <span class="accented">brick-kiln.</span>;" but the expression "fiery oven" is probably not intended to be taken literally, but metaphorically. Severe suffering is continually compared in Scripture to confinement in an oven or furnace (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18, 20, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). And we may best understand the present passage to mean simply that in the time of his anger David would subject such of his enemies as fell into his hands to very terrible sufferings. (See, as showing what extreme severities David did sometimes inflict on captured enemies, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a> which is to the point, as also is <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</span> The metaphor is followed up, with the addition that what was previously attributed to David alone is here declared to have the sanction of God.

Their destruction is brought upon them by their own selves. They plot against the people of God, and thus provoke God to anger, and cause him to deliver them into their enemy' s hand. It does not matter that they can effect nothing. The "intention" is enough. They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. The inability is not so much from a deficiency of strength in themselves, as from the opposition offered to their schemes by God. The best-laid plans an powerless, if God wills to baffle them.

The meaning is simply, "Thou shalt put them to flight." When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. The Authorized Version, by supplying "when" and "thine arrows," expresses what the psalmist has left to the intelligence of the reader. The psalmist says, "Thou shalt put them to flight; thou shalt  make ready upon thy strings against the face of them, no doubt meaning that the discharge of arrows would produce the hasty flight, but not saying it.

If he prayed, even on the cross, to be delivered from it, the prayer must have been offered with the reservations previously made in Gethsemane, "If it be possible" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>); "If thou be willing" (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>); "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." The human will in Christ was in favour of the deliverance; the Divine will, the same in Christ as in his Father, was against it. My darling - literally, <span class="accented">my only one</span> - from the power of the dog. By "my darling" there is no doubt that the soul is intended, both here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>. It seems to be so called as the most precious thing that each man possesses (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). "The dog" is used, not of an individual, but of the class, and is best explained, like the "dogs" in ver. 16, of the executioners. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a></div><div class="verse">Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save me from the lion's mouth</span> (comp. ver. 13). Either the chief persecutors, viewed as a class, or Satan, their instigator, would seem to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns;</span> rather, <span class="accented">even from the horns of the win oxen hast thou heard me.</span> The conviction suddenly comes to the Sufferer that he is heard. Still, the adversaries are round about him - the "dogs," the "lions," and the "strong bulls of Bashan," now showing as ferocious wild cattle, menacing him with their horns. But all the Sufferer's feelings are changed. The despondent mood has passed away. He is not forsaken. He has One to help. In one way or another he knows himself - feels himself - delivered; and he passes from despair and agony into a condition of perfect peace, and even exultation. He passes, in fact, from death to life, from humiliation to glory; and at once he proceeds to show forth his thankfulness by a burst of praise. The last strophe of the psalm (vers. 22-31) is the jubilant song of the Redeemer, now that his mediatorial work is done, and his life of suffering "finished" (<a href="../../par/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a></div><div class="verse">I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will declare thy Name unto my brethren</span>. The thought of the brethren is uppermost. As, when the body was removed, loving messages were at once sent to the disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), so, with the soul of the Redeemer in the intermediate state, the "brethren" are the first care. God's Name, and all that he has done - the acceptance of the sacrifice, the effectuation of man's salvation - shall be made known to them (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee</span>. He will join with them in praising and adoring his Father, so soon as circumstances allow (compare the Eucharist at Emmaus, <a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>).

"All Israel:" all the people of God are called upon to join in the praise which the Sea will henceforth offer to the Father through eternity. The praise of God is to be joined with the fear of God, according to the universal teaching of Scripture.

The Father might seem by his passivity to disregard his Son's affliction; but it was not really so. Every pang was marked, every suffering sympathized with. And the reward received from the Father was proportionate (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death;" and <a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>, "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; <span class="accented">wherefore</span> God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father"). <span class="cmt_word">Neither hath he hid his face from him; but</span> <span class="cmt_word">when he cried unto him, he heard.</span> There was no real turning away, no real forsaking.

The phraseology is that of the Mosaic dispensation, with which alone David was acquainted. But the fulfilment is in those services of praise where, whenever Christ's disciples are gathered together, there is he in the midst of them. <span class="cmt_word">I will pay my vows before them that fear him</span>. "Vows," in the strict sense of the word, are scarcely meant; rather "devotions" generally.

In the Eucharistic feasts of Christ's  kingdom it is "the meek" especially who shall eat, and be satisfied, feeling that they have all their souls long for - a full banquet, of the very crumbs of which they are not worthy. <span class="cmt_word">They shall praise the Lord that seek him</span>. The service shall be emphatically one of praise. <span class="cmt_word">Your heart shall live for ever</span>.

Christ has taken the kingdom, and even now rules on the earth - not yet wholly over willing subjects, but over a Church that is ever expanding more and more, and tending to become universal. And he is the Governor among the nations. Not the Governor of one nation only, but of all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a></div><div class="verse">All <i>they that be</i> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship</span>. The Christian feast is not for the poor and needy only, like Jewish sacrificial feasts, but for the "fat ones" of the earth as well - the rich and prosperous. As Hengstenberg observes, "This great spiritual feast is not unworthy of the presence even of those who live in the greatest abundance: it contains a costly viand, which all their plenty cannot give - a viand for which even the satisfied are hungry; and, on the other hand, the most needy and most miserable are not excluded" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 396). <span class="cmt_word">All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all mortal men what-soever - all that are on their way to the tomb - shall bow before Christ, either willingly as his worshippers, or unwillingly as his conquered enemies, made to lick the dust at his feet. <span class="cmt_word">And none can keep alive his own soul</span>. Life is Christ's gift; the soul cannot be kept alive except through <span class="accented">him</span>, by his quickening Spirit (<a href="../../par/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53, 63</a>).

So long as the world endures, Christ shall always have worshippers - a "seed" which will "serve" him. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be accounted to the Lord for a generation</span>. If we accept this rendering, we must understand that the seed of the first set of worshippers shall be the Lord's people for one generation, the seed of the next for another, and so on.

Who is worthy to be brought into contact with a God of such might and glory? Who shall ascend into his hill? God's "hill" is, in reality, the highest heaven, wherein he has his dwelling-place. Its representative on earth was, at this time, the Mount Zion, where it was already determined in the Divine counsels that the temple should be built, and whither David was now about to transfer the ark of the covenant (see the introductory paragraph). David asks the question as a warning to the Levites, whom he was about to employ in the transport of the ark, that they might purify themselves in heart and soul before venturing to take part in the solemn ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">Or who shall stand in his holy place?</span> Who, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, shall stand and minister inside the tabernacle, when the ark has been placed therein, and it has thus become, in a special sense, God's holy place?

"God's demands upon his people," as Hengstenberg observes, "go beyond the domain of action. Those only see him - those only are fit to ascend into his hill - who have a pure heart." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has not lusted after vain and worthless things, whose desires are subdued, brought into captivity to the Law of God, and kept under strict control. This is really implied in purity of heart. <span class="cmt_word">Nor sworn deceitfully</span>. False swearing is the worst - or, at any rate, one of the worst - sins of the tongue. The psalmist means to say that a man is not fit to draw near to God unless he is righteous in act, in thought, and in word.

This, no doubt, is possible, and removes all difficulty. But it is better to loose a Gordian knot than to cut it. We may keep the present text, and obtain a satisfactory sense, by regarding "Jacob" as grammatically in apposition with "generation," and translating, "This is the generation of them that seek him - that seek thy face - even Jacob." All they are not Israel who are of Israel (<a href="../../par/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>). The true Jacob consisted of those Israelites who answered to the character described in  ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. A break, or pause, here occurred, while the procession of Levites advanced to the very gates of the sanctuary. Then the strain was resumed - the choir being divided into two parts, which sang antiphonally.

God was regarded as dwelling between the cherubim on the mercy-seat, where the Shechinah from time to time made its appearance.

It has been generally recognized that the reception of the ark into the tabernacle on Mount Zion typified the entrance of our Lord into heaven after his ascension, whence our Church appoints this psalm as one of those to be recited on Ascension Day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/25.htm"><title>Psalm 25 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/25.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/25.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/25-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/24.htm" title="Psalm 24">&#9668;</a> Psalm 25 <a href="../psalms/26.htm" title="Psalm 26">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<<i>A Psalm</i> of David.>> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift; up my soul</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/86-4.htm">Psalm 86:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>).

Hence it is the constant prayer of every religious man that God will "lighten his darkness;" "make his way plain before his face;" "show him the path that he should walk in;" enable him to see, if no more, at any rate the next step which it is his duty to take. The idea has been beautifully expressed by a modern poet - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom<br />Lead thou me on.<br />The night is dark, and I am far from homo;<br />Lead thou me on.<br />Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br />The distant scene; one step enough for me."</span>

Job thought that God counted against him the "iniquities of his youth" (<a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>); David, with greater faith and a deeper insight into the true character of God, can ask with confidence that his may not be reckoned against him.

How much less will our heavenly Father! <span class="cmt_word">According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord!</span> Still, put me not from thy mind. "Remember thou me" always - but in the light of thy tender mercy, with the rays of thy love streaming over me and hiding the deformities of my transgressions.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">Good and upright <i>is</i> the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Good and upright is the Lord</span>. A transition. From prayer the psalmist turns to reflection, and meditates awhile (vers. 8-10) on the character and ways of God. God is, indeed, "good," as he has implied in the preceding verse - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, kind, tender, gentle, merciful; but he is also "upright" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) - just, straight, strict, undeviating from the path of right. As Bishop Butler observes, "Divine goodness, with which, if I mistake not, we make very free in our speculations, may not be a bare single disposition to produce happiness, but a disposition to make the good, the faithful, the honest man happy" ('Anal.,' 1:2, p. 41) - s disposition, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to be just as well as merciful to distribute happiness by the canon of right. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will he teach sinners in the way</span>. He will not abandon sinners - this is his "goodness;" but will reclaim them, chasten them, make them to walk in his way - this is his uprightness.

It is only such sinners as are "meek" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. humble, submissive, contrite, teachable - that God will take in hand and teach.

The psalmist here resumes the attitude of prayer, which he had laid aside in ver. 8. The" sins of his youth," and his other "transgressions," which he had asked God to forget (ver. 7), rankle in his own memory, and force him to cry out again and again for pardon (see ver. 18; <a href="../../par/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>, etc.). Here he beseeches God to pardon him "for his Name's sake," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the honour of his Name, that his mercy may Be known far and wide, and his goodness cause all the world to praise him. He enforces his plea by the confession, For it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his iniquity) is great; so great, that his need of forgiveness is excessive: so great, that to forgive it will be truly Godlike; so great, that, unless forgiven, he must be lost. (For his "great sin," see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4-17</a>.)

It seems to Christians a bold act to call on God for judgment, but the saints of the earlier dispensation, having, perhaps, a less keen sense of human imperfection, were wont to do so. It is Job's cry from his first utterance until his "words are ended;" and here we find David taking it up and re-echoing it. Man longs to hear the sentence of acquittal from the great Judge.

They are six - three positive and three negative. First of all, he keeps God's loving-kindness, or mercy (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>), ever before his eyes - reflects on it, meditates on it, presents it to his thought - continually. <span class="cmt_word">And I have walked in thy truth.</span> Secondly, he walks - he has always walked - in God s truth. God's Law is the truth (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-42.htm">Psalm 119:42</a>); and walking in God's truth is walking in the Law which he has given to men; as Hitzig, Maurer, and others have seen. Hengstenberg's exposition, "I have constantly thought upon thy faithfulness," cannot be admitted.

Neither will I go in with dissemblers. Nor will he go in with (nor has he, we may conclude, gone in with) dissemblers, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hypocrites. He has neither thrown in his lot with the light, vain persons who make no pretence to religion, nor with the pretenders, who "have the form of godliness, but deny the power thereof" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>).

Fifthly, he has hated, and hates, with a holy and strong abhorrence (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-22.htm">Psalm 139:22</a>), the congregation of evil-deers - the gatherings and assemblies of those who meet only for wicked purposes  - to sin themselves, and to draw others into like evil courses. This is a positive trait of a very marked character, and goes far beyond the explanation which has been given of it: "I take no part in assemblies for the ruin of others" (Hengstenberg). Sixthly and lastly, <span class="cmt_word">he will not sit with the wicked</span>. This only goes beyond the declarations in ver. 4 by extending to all wicked persons of every kind the avoidance there limited to "vain persons," and "dissemblers." The spirit is that indicated by Jacob in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>; by St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9-11</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-7.htm">Ephesians 5:7, 11</a>; and by St. John, on the celebrated occasion when he avoided contact with Cerinthus (Iren., 3:3, &sect; 4).

If not a necessary, it is at any rate a probable, exegesis, that David composed this psalm on an occasion when he was about to offer a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to God for some mercy recently vouchsafed him (ver. 7). Before offering, he feels the necessity of doing spiritually that which the priest' who officiated would have to do ceremonially (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>)  - to "wash his hands in innocency, and so to go to God's altar."

A further and final triumph is confidently anticipated. God will complete his work.

The rhythm alters from a jubilant double beat to a slow and mournful cadence. A cry is raised for mercy and pity - the wrath of God is deprecated - rejection and desertion are contemplated and prayed against (vers. 7-10). The danger from the enemy appears great and formidable (vers. 11, 12). With an effort of faith, the writer just saves himself from despair (ver. 14), and then, in brave words, braces himself up for further endurance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</span> There is no "when" in the original.

The order of the words in the original is as follows: "To thee said my heart - Seek ye my face - thy face, Lord, will I seek." And the full meaning seems to he, "To thee said my heart - Hast thou said unto men, Seek ye my face? I for one will obey thee - Thy face, Lord, will I seek." The command, "Seek ye my face," had been given by David to the people on the day that he set up the ark upon Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-11.htm">1 Chronicles 16:11</a>).

David felt from time to time as if God's face was hidden from him, as we see in other psalms  (<a href="../../par/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a>, etc.); and so also did other saints (<a href="../../par/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>). In most instances, probably, God sends the feeling as a chastisement, that the heart may turn with more sincerity to him. <span class="cmt_word">Put not thy servant away in anger</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> reject me not - cast me not off.

The cause of the change would seem to have been a confident assurance, arising out of the very act of prayer, that the prayer is heard and granted, so that the happy results prayed for are certain to follow. Such an assurance is certainly not attained by all those whose supplications are earnest and devout; but David appears to have enjoyed it not infrequently (see above, <a href="../../par/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications</span> (comp. ver. 2, with which this is, of set purpose, made exactly to correspond).

"What ails the heathen (<span class="accented">goim</span>)," he says. "that they rage?" or "make an uproar" (Kay), or "assemble tumultuously" (margin of Authorized Version and Revised,Version)?

And the rulers take counsel together. "Rulers" are persons having authority, but below the rank of kings Such were the ethnarchs and tetrarchs of the first century, the governors of provinces under the Roman emperor, the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and the like.

It is best to suppose that Messiah here takes the word, and maintains it to the end of ver. 9, when the psalmist resumes in his own person. Messiah "declares," or publishes, a "decree," made by God the Father in the beginning of all things, and communicated by him to the Son, whereby he made known the relationship between them, and invested the Son with sovereign power over the universe. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath said unto me</span>; rather, said unto me (see the Revised Version).

It is said that these words, and those of the next clause, "cannot describe the mild rule of Christ" (Rosenmuller, Do Wette, Hupfeld, etc.). But the objectors forget that there is a severe, as well as a  mild, side to the dealings of God with his human creatures. St. Paul notes in the same verse both the "severity" and the "goodness" of God (<a href="../../par/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>). Christ, though "the Prince of Peace," "came to send a sword upon the earth" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). As the appointed Judge of men, he takes vengeance on the wicked, while he rewards the righteous (<a href="../../par/luke/3-17.htm">Luke 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>). Nay, St. John, in the Apocalypse, declares that "out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations. and "<span class="accented">ye shall rule them with a rod of iron"</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; comp. 2:27; 12:5). So, with respect to the other clause of the verse  - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel</span> - it is to be noted that there is a similar threat made by the Lord of hosts against Jerusalem in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 19:11), and that under the new covenant the same is threatened in the Revelation (Revelation 2:27). In truth, both covenants are alike in denouncing the extreme of God's wrath on impenitent sinners, such as those here spoken of.

Blessed <i>are</i> all they that put their trust in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kiss the Son</span>. It is certainly remarkable that we have here a different word for "Son" from that employed in ver. 7, and ordinarily in the Hebrew Bible. Still, there is other evidence that the word here used, <span class="accented">bar</span>, existed in the Hebrew no less than in the Aramaic, viz. <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, where it is repeated thrice. It was probably an archaic and poetic word, like our "sire" for "father," rarely used, but, when used, intended to mark some special dignity. Hengstenberg suggests that the writer's motive in prefering <span class="accented">bar to ben</span> in this place was to avoid the cacophony which would have arisen from the juxtaposition of <span class="accented">ben</span> and pen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>); and this is quite possible, but as a secondary rather than as the main reason. By "<span class="accented">kiss</span> the Son" we must understand "pay him homage," salute him as King in the customary way (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he be angry</span>. The omission of a customary token of respect is an insult which naturally augers the object of it (<a href="../../par/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye perish from the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">as to the way."</span> To anger the Son is to bring destruction on our "way," or course in life. <span class="cmt_word">When his wrath is kindled but a little</span>; rather, for soon <span class="accented">his wrath may be kindled</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are all they that put their trust in him</span>. The writer ends with words of blessing, to relieve the general severity of the psalm (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>, etc.).

Indeed, it was doubtless with some reference to the number of his foes that he wished to know how many followers he could rally to his standard in case of need. If the plague had continued much longer, David's military strength would have been seriously crippled, and his foes would have rejoiced with reason.

For the nature of the "cry" spoken of, comp. vers. 8-10, which are an expansion of the present verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when I was on the verge of the grave, just ready to depart to the unseen world, thy interposition saved me, and brought me, as it were, back to life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast kept me alive</span>.

David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see <a href="../../par/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, etc.). On the present occasion, however, the people who had escaped the pestilence had almost exactly the same reason for praising and thanking God that David had, and were bound to join him in his thanksgiving service. And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness; literally, <span class="accented">give thanks to the memorial of his holiness</span>, which is explained, by reference to <a href="../../par/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, as meaning,  "Give thanks to his holy Name" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-21.htm">Psalm 145:21</a>).

His favour, on the contrary, is enduring; it continues all their life. Weeping may endure for a night; rather, at <span class="accented">eventide weeping comes to lodge</span>, or <span class="accented">to pass the night</span>; but joy cometh in the morning; or, <span class="accented">but at morn joy arriveth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-26.htm">Job 33:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>).

Prosperity had worked an ill effect on the psalmist, had made him self-confident and proud. He "said in his heart," as the wicked man in <a href="../../par/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>, only in still stronger phrase, "I shall not be moved;" literally, <span class="accented">I shall not be moved for</span> ever. His heart was lifted up, and in the spirit of self-glorification he gave command for the numbering of the people. The result was the plague, and the death of seventy thousand of his subjects. Into these details he does not here enter. He is content to trace his sin to its bitter root of pride, and to glance at its punishment (ver. 7) and his repentance (vers. 8-10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a></div><div class="verse">LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <i>and</i> I was troubled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, by thy favour thou hast</span> (rather, <span class="accented">hadst</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>made my mountain to stand strong.</span> It was thy favour which had given me the "prosperity" whereby I was exalted, and which I thought rooted in myself - which had made Zion strong, and enabled me to triumph over my enemies. But, lo! suddenly all was changed - <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled</span>. God turned his face away, declared himself angry with his servant (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7-12</a>), and sent the dreadful plague which in a single day destroyed seventy thousand lives. Then David, feeling that God's face was indeed turned from him, "was troubled."

The part of his prayer most honourable to David is not recorded by himself, but by the historians. He tells us of his secret wrestlings with God, his complaints and expostulations - his cries and pleadings as they remained in his memory; he passes over the desire to die for his people, which the historians put on record.

God has "no pleasure in the death of him that dieth" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>), and certainly can obtain no profit from the destruction of any of his creatures. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the dust praise thee?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). In death, so far as the power of death extends, there can be no action; the lips cease to move, and therefore cannot hymn God's praise - the "dust" is inanimate, and, while it remains dust, cannot speak. What the freed soul may do, the psalmist does not consider. Very little was known under the old dispensation concerning the intermediate state. <span class="cmt_word">Shall it declare thy truth?</span> The dust certainly could not do this, unless revivified and formed into another living body.

Suddenly, in a moment, all was changed. The angel ceased to slay. God bade him hold his hand. The Prophet Gad was sent with the joyful news to David, and commanded him at once to build an altar at Jehovah. Then the mourning ceased, and a joyful ceremonial was instituted, of which dancing, as so often, formed a part (see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">put off</span> (rather, <span class="accented">didst put off</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my sackcloth</span>.

In the struggle between Absalom and David more depended upon wise counsel than upon mere force (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31-37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-5.htm">2 Samuel 17:5-23</a>).

It was, perhaps, by a device of AhithopheI's that David was induced to quit Jerusalem and go into exile.

Our Lord's adoption of these words, and application of them to himself and his own departure from earth, have given them a special sacredness beyond that which attaches to Scripture generally. At the same time, they have impressed on them a new meaning, since David was not thinking of a final committal of his soul, as distinct from his body, into the hands of the Creator, but only intended solemnly to commit himself, both soul and body, into the Divine keeping, to be preserved from the attacks of his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth</span>; or, thou <span class="accented">hast delivered me</span>, <span class="accented">O Lord God of truth.</span> It is redemption in the general sense of "deliverance from peril," not redemption from sin, of which the psalmist speaks. David, having frequently experienced such deliverance in the past, is emboldened to expect now another deliverance.

By "lying vanities" are meant idolatrous practices, or possibly such superstitious usages as recourse to witch-craft and divination. (For David's <span class="accented">hatred</span> of such persons as are here glanced at, see <a href="../../par/psalms/26-5.htm">Psalm 26:5</a>.) But I trust in the Lord.

Anticipating the "mercy" which he has craved (vers. 2-4), the psalmist determines to "be glad and rejoice in it." <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast considered my trouble</span>. When God looks upon trouble and considers it, he is sure to compassionate the sufferer, and to grant him some relief<span class="cmt_word">. Thou hast known my soul in adversities</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, "The Lord <span class="accented">knoweth</span> the way of the righteous" ).

Having cheered himself with the enumeration of these grounds of encouragement (vers. 5-8), the psalmist again returns to prayer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a></div><div class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <i>yea</i>, my soul and my belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble</span>. The psalmist follows up his prayer for mercy by an exposition of his need of mercy. He is in trouble, in sore trouble - "hard pressed," as Hengstenberg translates - distressed both in mind and body. <span class="cmt_word">Mine eye is consumed with grief</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>, where the expression is almost identical). The grief intended is "that produced by provocation or spiteful treatment" (Kay). It causes him to weep so much that his eye is well-nigh "consumed" or "eaten away." Yea, my soul and my belly. Some explain this as meaning simply "my soul and my body" (Hengstenberg, Alexander, Revised Version); but others regard the "belly" as denoting "the very centre of physical life and of the emotions" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a></div><div class="verse">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing</span>. The psalmist's grief is of old standing. It dates from the time of his great sin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4-17</a>), which is thought to have preceded the revolt of Absalom by the space of twelve years. This sin necessitated a lifelong repentance (<a href="../../par/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>, etc.). My strength faileth because of mine iniquity. Other causes had, no doubt, contributed to produce the profound depression of the psalmist at this period, but none was of equal force with this (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-14</a>, etc.). It caused his strength to fail utterly, and led to complete prostration both st mind and body. <span class="cmt_word">And my bones are</span> <span class="cmt_word">consumed;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>racked with pain, as though they were being gnawed away.

The psalmist complains of the loss of his reputation. Absalom's rebellion was preceded by a long course of calumnious accusation  of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-4</a>), whereby men's hearts were stolen away from him, and his character blackened. His enemies made the most of these ill reports, and turned them to his reproach (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But especially among my neighbours</span>. Not that they reproached him more than others, but that he felt their reproaches more keenly. <span class="cmt_word">And a fear to mine acquaintance</span>. His acquaintances were afraid of being recognized as such, and involved in his ill repute. They that did sea me without; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "out of doors," or "in the street." <span class="cmt_word">Fled from me</span>.

The calumnies circulated against him had reached David's ears, and these had so affected him that he felt as described in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Fear was on every side, while they took counsel together against me.</span> Fear was "on every side" - in his own heart, and in the hearts of all his friends - when it came to the point of his enemies holding a formal council, in which the matter discussed was the best mode of proceeding against him to take away his life. The particulars of such a council are given in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They devised to take away my life.</span> That David's life was sought is apparent from the last clause of ver. 2, "I will smite the king only."

Having fully represented the miserable condition to which he is reduced (vers. 9-13), David now returns to expressions of trust in God, and to earnest prayer to him (comp. ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">I said, Thou art my</span> <span class="cmt_word">God;</span> rather, I <span class="accented">have said.</span> In all my sufferings, dangers, and difficulties, I have always clung to thee, and said, "Thou, and thou alone, art, and ever shalt be, my God."

Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me (camp. vers. 1, 2, 4). The great need under existing circumstances was deliverance. Absalom was looked for daily to "pass over Jordan, and all the men of Israel with him" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). A battle was imminent. If the day went against David, and his army was defeated, he would necessarily fall into the hands of his "enemies" and "persecutors," in which case he could not hope that they would spare his life (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2, 12</a>).

This expression is first used in the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>). Its intrinsic beauty and poetry recommended it to the psalmists, with whom it recurs frequently (camp. <a href="../../par/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-5.htm">Psalm 80:5, 7, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-135.htm">Psalm 119:135</a>).

"I have," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "been ever thy true worshipper."

David turns from prayer to praise, and in the four next verses (vers. 19-22) eulogizes the goodness and mercy and marvellous loving-kindness of God, who has wrought gloriously for his people in the past, and has further an ample store of mercies laid up for them in the future. <span class="cmt_word">Which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</span> God had wrought his mercies <span class="accented">for</span> his own people, but <span class="accented">in the sight</span> of men generally, whether good or bad.

The union of all three, as here in vers. 1, 2, is complete remission or forgiveness.

"Iniquity" - the defilement of the sinner's own soul by sin - is not at once removable; if removable at all, it is only so by long lapse of time, and God's special mercy. But God can, at his own will and at any moment, "not impute" it - not count it against the sinner to his detriment. Then in God's sight the man is clean; it is as though the iniquity were not there. And in whose spirit there is no guile; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no false seeming - no hypocrisy - where repentance has been sincere and real.

The time spoken of is that which immediately followed the commission of the adultery, and which continued until Nathan uttered the words, "Thou art the man!" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I suffered grievous pain, both bodily and mental.

Unconfessed sin rankles in the heart of a man who is not far gone in vice,  but has been surprised into a wicked action, no sooner done than regretted. Such a one, in Archbishop Leighton's words, "Vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igne." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a></div><div class="verse">For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me</span>. David sees now that his sufferings at this time came from God, and were a part of the punishment of his sin. They continued without intermission both by day and by night. His conscience was never wholly at rest. My moisture is turned into the drought of summer; literally, <span class="accented">my sap was changed through summer drought</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vital principle, which had been strong in him, was changed - burnt up and exhausted - by the heat of God's wrath.

Conscience once fully awakened, all reticence was broken down.

Hengstenberg well remarks that the psalmist is probably not speaking of a "making known by the mouth," but of "an inward confession, such as is accompanied with painful repentance and sorrow, with begging of pardon for sin and for the offence rendered to the Divine Majesty." <span class="cmt_word">I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</span> Upon David's confession, whether it were inward or outward, followed without any interval God's forgiveness - forgiveness which, however, did not preclude the exaction of a penalty required for the justification of God's ways to man (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>), and also, perhaps, for proper impressing of the offender himself, who would have been less sensible of the heinousness of his sin, if it had gone unpunished.

But such a sudden intrusion of a Divine utterance, without any notice of a change of speaker, is without parallel in the Psalms, and should certainly not be admitted without some plain necessity. Here is no necessity at all. The words are quite suitable in the mouth of David, as an admonition to the Israelites of his time; they accord with the title, which he himself seems to have prefixed to the psalm, and explain it; and they fulfil the promise made in <a href="../../par/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">go.</span> We must suppose the "godly man" of ver. 6 addressed, if we regard David as the speaker.

The singular is exchanged for the plural, since the "instruction" is now intended, not for the godly man only, but for all. Israel had been always stiff-necked (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>), like a restive horse or mule. David exhorts them to be so no more. The horse and mule are excusable, since they "have no understanding " - or, "no discernment" - Israel would be inexcusable, since it had the gift of reason. <span class="cmt_word">Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose adornings are with bit and bridle to hold them in</span> (compare the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Lest they come near unto thee</span>. This clause is obscure. It may mean, "Lest they come <span class="accented">too</span> near to thee," so as to do thee damage, as when a riding horse tosses his head and strikes the rider in the face, or when a chariot horse rears and falls back upon the driver; or it may  mean, "Else they will not come near to thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until they are trapped with bit and bridle, they will refuse to come near to thee.

David's psalms almost always end with a note of joy, or at any rate in a tone that is cheerful and encouraging. The present psalm, though reckoned among the penitential ones, both begins and ends with joyful utterances. In vers. 1, 2 David pours forth the feeling of gladness which fills his own heart. Here he calls upon the "righteous" generally, who yet need forgiveness, to rejoice with him. <span class="cmt_word">And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart</span>. All ye, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are honest and sincere in your endeavours after well-doing.

The harp obtains mention here for the first time in the Psalms. Reference, however, had been made to it previously in Genesis, Job, and the First Book of Samuel. There is reason to believe that the instrument, as known to the Hebrews, was a simple one, consisting of a nearly triangular framework of wood, crossed by seven strings. The Egyptians were acquainted from early times with a very much more elaborate instrument  - harps which stood six feet high upon a broad base of their own, and had as many as twenty-two strings (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 521).

He had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth  (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). He had as yet no body of followers.

Not content with praising God in his own person, the psalmist calls on Israel generally to praise the Lord with him. He then proceeds to assign reasons why God should be praised (vers. 4-10).

David apparently speaks of some special occasion on which he "sought the Lord," and some special request which he made of him, but does not tell us what the occasion or request was. We may presume that it was in some way connected with his "escape to the cave Adullam" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And delivered me from all my fears;</span> literally, frown <span class="accented">all the things which I feared</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>).

Almost a repetition of ver. 4, but in the third person instead of the first. The "poor man" intended is David him* self, not an ideal poor man. Otherwise the demonstrative "this" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) would not have been employed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a></div><div class="verse">The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them</span>. According to some commentators (Rosenmuller, 'Four Friends,' and others), the expression, "angel of the Lord," is here used as a collective, and means the angels generally. With this certainly agrees the statement that the angel "encampeth <span class="accented">round about</span> them that fear him;" and the illustration from <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14-18</a> is thus exactly apposite. But others deny that "the angel of the Lord" has ever a collective sense, and think a single personality must necessarily* be intended, which they regard as identical with "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>), and "the angel of the Lord's presence" spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>); so Kay, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Professor Alexander, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' When pressed to say how this one angel can "encamp round" a number of persons, they reply that, of course, he has his subordinates with him - a "spangled host," that "keep watch in squadrons bright;" and that he is said to do what they do, which is no doubt quite in accordance with ordinary modes of speech. Thus, however, the two expositions become nearly identical, since, according to both, it is the angelic host which "encamps around" the faithful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a></div><div class="verse">O taste and see that the LORD <i>is</i> good: blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> trusteth in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O taste</span> <span class="cmt_word">and see that the Lord is</span> <span class="cmt_word">good;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> put the matter to the test of experience (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-3.htm">1 Peter 2:3</a>).

Trust in God is a feeling which is blessed in itself. God also showers blessings on such as trust in him.

Fear of God, a reverent and godly fear, will always accompany trust in God, such as God approves.

Some suppose the "young lions" here to represent the proud and violent, as in <a href="../../par/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>. But it is simpler to take the present passage literally. In God's animal creation even the strongest suffer want for a time, and have no remedy; his human creatures need never be in want, <span class="cmt_word">since they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing</span>.

The writer assumes the <span class="accented">role</span> of the teacher, and, addressing his readers as "sons," undertakes to "teach them the fear of the Lord" (ver, 11), or, in other words, to point out to them in what true religion consists. This he does in two remarkable verses (vers. 13, 14); after which he proceeds, in the  remainder of the psalm, to give reasons which may incline them to the practice of it (vers. 15-22). The reasons resolve themselves into two main grounds - the tender love and care of God for the righteous (vers. 15, 17-20, 22), and his hostility to and punishment of the wicked (vers. 16, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come, ye children, hearken unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-32.htm">Proverbs 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach you the fear of the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will teach you the nature of true religion.

They are more difficult to avoid than any others; they cling closer to us; they are scarcely ever wholly laid aside. "If any man offend not in word, the same is a <span class="accented">perfect</span> man, and able also to bridle the whole body" (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). The meek Moses "spake unadvisedly with his lips" (<a href="../../par/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>). Job "darkened counsel by words without knowledge "(<a href="../../par/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a>). St. Peter's words on one occasion drew upon him the rebuke, "Get thee behind me, Satan" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a>).

First, he enjoins negative goodness - "depart from evil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing that is wrong; break no laws of God, no command of conscience; have a conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards man. Secondly, he requires positive goodness - "Do good;" i.e. actively perform the will of God from the heart; discharge every duty; practise every virtue; carry out the precepts of the moral law in every particular. <span class="cmt_word">Seek peace, and pursue it.</span> It is not clear why this virtue - one of many - is specially enjoined; but probably some circumstances of the time made the recommendation advisable.

The word translated "plead" is a judicial term; but the context shows that it was in the battle-field, rather than in the law-courts, that David's cause was to be pleaded. The second hemistich is therefore added to explain and correct the first; it is fighting, not pleading, that is needed under the circumstances.

In the first place, the text is uncertain, since some manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>, "his heart," in the place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart." And further, whichever reading we prefer, the meaning is far from clear. Dr. Kay translates, "Transgression's oracle to the wicked is, 'In the interior of my own heart;'" and understands the meaning to be that the sinfulness of the wicked man deludes him into the belief that his wickedness is known to no one but himself - it is all safely locked up in the recesses of his own heart. Professor Alexander suggests as possible, "Thus saith depravity to the wicked man, 'In the midst of my heart, there is no fear of God before his (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's) eyes.'" Others, preferring <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, render, "Transgression speaks to the wicked within his heart; There is no fear of God," etc.; regarding the two clauses as perfectly independent the one of the ether. This is, perhaps, the best explanation. There is <span class="cmt_word">no fear of God before his eyes.</span> Either he belongs to the class of "fools, who say in their heart, There is no God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>), or he agrees with those who cry, "Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face; he will never see it" (<a href="../../par/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>).

This quality is revealed, not on earth only, but also in heaven, towards the angels. Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Next to loving-kindness in God comes "faithfulness"  - fidelity to every promise that he has ever made, unswerving attachment to those whom he has once loved, undeviating maintenance of the truth (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/57-10.htm">Psalm 57:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/108-4.htm">Psalm 108:4</a>).

According to Aristotle, we have a special emotion implanted in our nature - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - which causes us to "fret" when we witness undeserved prosperity ('Rhet.,' 2:9, &sect; 1). Certainly the feeling is very common and very strong; it is also characteristic of the best natures (see <a href="../../par/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>). The feeling does not need to be eradicated, but only to be held in check. Faith in God's retributive justice will enable us calmly to await "the end" (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>), in full assurance that ultimately God's vengeance will overtake the wicked man, and he will receive condign punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity</span>. Envy is not a natural passion. To envy the evil-doers on account of their prosperity is at once a folly and a danger. Their position is really not enviable; and, if we allow ourselves to envy them, we shall be tempted to follow their example (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>).

And, no doubt, if we compare time with eternity, the longest triumph that the wicked ever enjoy is but for a brief space, is soon gone, endures "but for a moment."

The mere continuance of a man's posterity in a prosperous condition cannot exhaust the meaning of such phrases as, "Their inheritance shall be for ever;" "Dwell for evermore;" "The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever." If David himself meant no more than this, yet the Holy Spirit which inspired him may have meant more. At any rate, to the Christian the words will always bring up the thought of that "inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, which is reserved for us in heaven" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).

The social condition of the Israelites was very unlike that of modern European communities. Though there were rich and poor among them, there could scarcely be any that were <span class="accented">very</span> poor. Where there was a general obligation upon all well-disposed persons to lend to such as were in need, and no interest could be asked upon loans, and in the year of jubilee all debts were remitted, and mortgaged lands returned to their original owners or their families, actual begging was scarcely possible, and at any rate could only be brought about by extreme and reckless misconduct. Many philanthropists believe that even at the present time in our own country mendicancy is nearly always the consequence of persistence in evil courses. Still more must this have been the case in Palestine in the time of the monarchy (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>).

Wicked men hate righteous men, as being a reproach to them, and also as being a hindrance and a danger. The righteous thwart their plans, oppose their proceedings, often frustrate their counsels. Sometimes their opposition brings the wicked man into peril, as when it takes the shape of prosecution before a court, or of help given to one who has fallen among thieves. Hence the hatred felt by the wicked towards the righteous is not surprising. It leads the wicked to entertain murderous thoughts - to be ever "watching" for an opportunity when he may take the righteous man at a disadvantage, and, if no other means of removing him from his path present themselves, kill him. Modern civilization, with its precautions and "resources," prevents actual violence for the most part; but the tour-derous instinct remains, and even now, in his heart, many a wicked man is a murderer.

Hengstenberg is right, "The arrows of the Almighty denote all the chastisements of sin depending on God." And thy hand presseth me sore. The verb used is the same in both clauses; but it is difficult to express both ideas by one term in English. Dr. Kay makes the attempt by translating, "For thine arrows have sunk deep in me; yea, thine hand sank heavily on me."

The writer reverts to his bodily pains. He has "wounds," which "stink" and "are corrupt;" or "fester and become noisome," which may be boils, or bed-sores, and which make him a loathsome object to others (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of my foolishness</span>.

In concluding his accounts of his physical condition, the writer passes from details to more vague and general statements. He is "feeble," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> generally weak and wanting in vigour - he is "sore broken," or "sore bruised" (Revised Version), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> full of aches and pains, as though he had been bruised all over - and the "disquietness of his heart" causes him to vent his anguish in "roarings," or groanings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a></div><div class="verse">Lord, all my desire <i>is</i> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - In this second strophe the physical are subordinated to the moral sufferings; the former being touched on in one verse only (ver. 10), the latter occupying the rest of the section. Of these the  most tangible are the pain caused by the desertion of his "lovers," "friends," and "kinsmen" (ver. 11), and the alarm arising from the action taken, simultaneously, by his ill wishers and adversaries (ver. 12). These afflictions have reduced him to a condition of silence - almost of apathy, such as is described in vers. 13, 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span> This has been called "the first indication of hope in this psalm;" but there is a gleam of hope in the prayer of ver. 1. Hope, however, does here show itself more plainly than before. The psalmist has laid "all his desire" before God, and feels that God is weighing and considering it. He has also opened to him "all his groanings" - uttered freely all his complaint. This he could have been led to do only from a conviction that God was not irrevocably offended with him, but might, by repentance, confession, and earnest striving after amendment (ver. 20), be reconciled, and induced to become his Defence (ver. 15) and his Salvation (ver. 22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a></div><div class="verse">My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My heart panteth</span>. This verse, which reverts to the bodily sufferings, seems a little out of place. But Hebrew poetry is not logical, and cares little for exact arrangement. Three more bodily troubles are noticed, of which this is the first - the heart "pants," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throbs, or palpitates violently. My strength faileth me. The strength suddenly fails. As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. The sight swims, and is swallowed up in darkness (comp. <a href="../../par/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>).

The psalmist feels himself to be "stricken, smitten of God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>). He looks for comfort and sympathy to his friends, but they, with a selfishness that is only too common, hold aloof, draw away item him, and desert him (comp. <a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And my kinsmen stand afar off</span>; or, my <span class="accented">neighbours.</span> The stricken deer is forsaken by the rest of the herd (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56, 58</a>).

To the desertion of friends is added the persecution of enemies, who take advantage of the debility and prostration caused by sickness to plot against the writer's life, to "lay snares for him," and devise evil against him. Those who assign the psalm to David suppose the devices described in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a> to he referred to. <span class="cmt_word">And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long</span>; literally, <span class="accented">speak malignity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> calumniate me - bring false accusations against me (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-7.htm">2 Samuel 16:7, 8</a>).

I took no notice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I made as if I was deaf. <span class="cmt_word">And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth</span>. So far this psalmist, whether David or another, was a type of Christ (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).

Canon Cook suggests that they introduce four reasons for the psalmist's silence (vers. 13, 14) and abstinence front self-justification: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because God hears him, and will make answer for him (ver. 15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because, if he spoke, he might give further occasion to his enemies (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because he feels in danger, and is conscious of sin (ver. 17); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> because he has no course open to him but confession and contrition. If we are justified in attributing the psalm to David, and in assigning its composition to the period immediately preceding Absalom's rebellion, we must look upon it as opening to us  a view of David's condition of mind at that time which is of great interest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a></div><div class="verse">But mine enemies <i>are</i> lively, <i>and</i> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong</span>. The psalmist goes back to the thought of his enemies, to whom he has made no answer, and whom he has not ventured to rebuke (vers. 13, 14). He remembers that they are full of life and strength; he calls to mind the fact that they are many in number; he puts on record the cause of their enmity, which is not his sin, but his earnest endeavour to forsake his sin and follow after righteousness (ver. 20); and then, in conclusion, he makes a direct appeal to God for aid against them - first negatively (ver. 21), and then positively in the final outburst, "Make haste to help me, O Lord my Salvation" (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span> This suits well the time of Absalom's conspiracy, when day by day more and more of the people forsook David and joined the party of his son.

The pain at my heart was not quieted thereby, nor even lessened; rather, it was roused up, quickened, and aggravated. This is the natural result of repressing any strong feeling.

The psalmist is weary of life, expects nothing from it, feels that it is "altogether vanity." He asks, therefore, not exactly for death, but that it may be told him how long he will have to endure the wretched life that he is leading. He anticipates no relief except in death, and feels, at any rate for the time, that he would welcome death as a deliverer<span class="cmt_word">. That I may know how frail I am.</span> So most moderns; but Hengstenberg denies that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;</span> can ever mean "frail," and falls back upon the old rendering, "that I may know when I shall cease [to be]," which certainly gives a very good sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou hast made my days <i>as</i> an handbreadth; and mine age <i>is</i> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state <i>is</i> altogether vanity. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou hast made my days as a handbreadth</span>. It seems inconsistent that one who professes to be weary of his life should then complain of life's shortness. But such inconsistency is human. Job does the same (<a href="../../par/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And mine age is as nothing before thee</span>. The short human existence can scarcely be regarded by God as existence at all; rather, it is mere nothingness<span class="cmt_word">. Verily every man living at his best state is but vanity</span>. So our Revisers. But most moderns translate, "Verily every man living was ordained for utter vanity" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a></div><div class="verse">Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <i>riches</i>, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely every man walketh in a vain show</span>; literally, in an image, or "as an image;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a mere semblance of life, but without the reality. <span class="cmt_word">Surely they are disquieted in vain</span>.

And now - under these circumstances - human life being what it is, and all men nothing but vanity, what is my hope? what is my expectation? what am I waiting for? A cry, as it would seem, of utter despair. But when the night is darkest, day dawns. "Out of the depths" comes forth the voice of faith  - "My hope is in THEE!" There is always hope in God When our father and mother forsake us, the Lord taketh us up. He will not leave us nor forsake us. So the psalmist ends his complaint by throwing himself into the arms of the Divine mercy, and unreservedly submitting himself to God's will. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a></div><div class="verse">Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Deliver me from all my transgressions</span>. The approach to God quickens in every God-fearing man the sense of sin and the longing for pardon. So the psalmist has no sooner thrown himself upon God as his one Hope, than the thought of his sin occurs to him - the sin which has brought upon him all his misery; and his first prayer is to be "delivered" from it. <span class="cmt_word">Make me not the reproach of the foolish</span>. So long as his afflictions continued, the psalmist would be an object of scorn to the fool and the un  =   godly. He prays, therefore, secondly, that the punishment of his sin may cease.

The "quarrel" has led the "hand" to deal the "stroke" by which the sufferer is "consumed" or "wasted away" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a></div><div class="verse">When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man <i>is</i> vanity. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity</span>. The calamities which God sends on a man are of the nature of "rebukes" addressed to his spirit. They are intended to teach, instruct, warn, deter from evil-doing (see <a href="../../par/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth</span>; or, "thou dost consume, as by a moth, what he prizes;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his health, his strength, "all wherein he has joy and satisfaction" (Hengstenberg).

This has become a sort of refrain, terminating the second as well as the first part of the psalm (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-8.htm">Psalm 107:8, 15, 21, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1, 11, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21</a>).

Tears appeal to the Divine pity in an especial way. "Weep not!" said our Lord to the widow woman at Nain; and to Mary Magdalene, "Why weepest thou?" He himself offered up his supplications with strong crying and tears" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>); and so his faithful servants (<a href="../../par/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a>: <a href="../../par/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>; Lain. 2:11; <a href="../../par/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>).

This call is generally made when God's forbearance towards his enemies is thought to have been excessive, and his tolerance of sinners too great. <span class="cmt_word">Save me, O my God</span>. David was in imminent danger. "All Israel" had come against him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15</a>). He was short of supplies (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>). He was doubtful how God was disposed towards him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25, 26</a>). It was a time when, unless God would save, there could be no hope. Hence the intense earnestness of his prayer. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone</span>. Heretofore, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, thou hast always taken my part - thou hast smitten mine enemies, and given me victory over them, and by breaking their jaw-bones thou hast taken away from them all power to hurt (see <a href="../../par/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>). The reference is, of course, to David's long series of victories, as those over the Philistines (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>), over Moab (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), over Hadadezer, King of Zobah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3, 4</a>), over the Syrians of Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), over the Edomites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13, 14</a>), over the Ammonites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7-14</a>), and over the "Syrians beyond the river" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>).

Others a pit which is filled with noise as a warrior, with crash of arms and amid the shouts of enemies, falls into it. But pits, though used in hunting, were not employed in warfare. The explanation that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> here is to be taken in the secondary sense of "destruction" or "misery," seems to me preferable (see the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of the miry</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 14</a>).

Mercy and praise are cause and effect. The deliverance recorded in ver. 2 produces the praise of vers. 3-5. The phrase, "our God," shows us how David instinctively identifies himself with his people.

Will the right return be by sacrifices and burnt offerings? No, the psalmist answers to himself; it is not these which God really "desires." Samuel had already preached the doctrine, "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David goes further. Apart from a spirit of obedience, sacrifice and offering are not desired or required at all; rather, as Isaiah says, they are a weariness and an abomination (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11, 12</a>). The one thing needed is obedience - a cheerful, willing obedience to all that God reveals as his will. <span class="cmt_word">Mine ears hast thou opened</span>. Either, "Thou hast taken away my deafness, and given me ears open to receive and embrace thy Law;" or, perhaps, with special reference to <a href="../../par/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, "Thou hast accepted me as thy voluntary servant, and bored through mine ear, to mark that I am thy servant for ever." <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required</span>. Of the four kinds of offering mentioned in this verse, the first (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d1;&#x5d7;</span>) is the ordinary offering of a victim at the altar in sacrifice; the second (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>), the meat offering of flour, with oil and frankincense accompanying it; the third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) is the "whole burnt offering," representative of complete self-sacrifice; and the fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), the "sin offering," or "trespass offering," of which the special intention was expiation.

David's psalms furnish a running commentary on these statements. Composed, as appears from the titles, mainly for use in the "great congregation," they set forth the righteousness, faithfulness, salvation, loving-kindness, and truth of God in the strongest possible way. Contemporary Israel, and later Israel, and the Church which has succeeded to the place of the original Israelites, and become "the Israel of God," are alike indebted to him for the wonderful strains in which he has shown forth and magnified these qualities of the Almighty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a></div><div class="verse">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord</span>. The supplicatory portion of the psalm here commences. David beseeches God, whose loving-kindness is so great (ver. 10), not to withhold <span class="accented">from him</span> those "tender mercies" which he lavishes so freely. As he is bent on "not withholding," or "refraining," his lips (ver. 9), so it is fitting that God should not "withhold," or "refrain" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>) his kindness. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me</span> (compare the last clause of ver. 10).

The exact nature of the "evils" is not mentioned; but the worst of them appears to be "the deep and bitter consciousness of sin" revealed in the next clause. Another was, beyond all doubt, the continued animosity of enemies (ver. 14). Mental and bodily weakness may have been added, and have completed the crushing load whereof complaint is made. It is noted that the exceedingly deep consciousness of sin here displayed "belongs altogether to a late part of David's life" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not</span> <span class="cmt_word">able to look up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so that</span> 1 <span class="accented">am not able to see.</span> An actual failure of sight seems to be intended (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>; 28:10). <span class="cmt_word">They are more than the hairs</span> <span class="cmt_word">of my head;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are more in number. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore my heart faileth me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my courage" and "my strength of mind" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a>).

Though one deliverance is just effected (ver. 2), it is not enough; something more is required.

Whether the detachment was the work of David or another, is uncertain. The differences between the two versions are slight (see the comment on Psalm 70.). The present verse repeats almost exactly <a href="../../par/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a> and 26.

David had concluded the preceding psalm by calling himself "poor and needy." He commences the present one by pronouncing a blessing on all those who "consider," or tenderly regard, and, so far as they can, assist the peer and afflicted. It is not so much actual poverty, as humiliation and weakness, of which he is speaking. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the day of evil.</span> As he has pity on his fellow-men, so God will have pity upon him (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-33.htm">Matthew 18:33</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>, etc.).

Continuance in life is always regarded as a blessing in the Old Testament; it is only in the New that to "depart, and be with Christ," is pronounced "far better" (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be blessed upon the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his long life shall be a happy one. <span class="cmt_word">And thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">do not thou deliver him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>). The psalmist changes from dogmatic assertion to prayer, not, however, intending to express any doubt that his prayer will be granted.

The worst of all his woes - the root and origin of them all - <span class="accented">fons</span> <span class="accented">et origo mall</span>, is his own sinfulness. Unless that is cured, all other alleviation is vain.

Another head of suffering, viz. misrepresentation, calumny, abuse, on the part of enemies. Absalom had stolen away the hearts of the children of Israel from David by misrepresenting him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>). Shimei had followed the example, adding to his misrepresentation abuse and cursing (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). Absalom's aiders and abettors generally, no doubt, joined in the chorus. This, then, is David's second subject of complaint, and one that he felt keenly - his enemies spoke evil of him. Farther, they desired and anticipated his death. <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (they said) <span class="cmt_word">shall he die, and his name perish?</span> David evidently was, or had been, when his enemies thus spoke, on the bed of sickness, prostrate, and in danger of his life. While he thus suffered, they rejoiced, expecting his early demise. When he was dead, they intended that his name should "perish;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that his memory should be utterly rooted out.

The "thing of Belial" here intended may, perhaps, be the disease from which David was suffering, but is more probably some disgraceful charge or infamous calumny which had been circulated concerning him, and was now crushing him down. This calumny is represented as poured out upon him like a coating of molten metal (see <a href="../../par/job/41-23.htm">Job 41:23, 24</a>), and so cleaving  to him. <span class="cmt_word">And now</span> <span class="cmt_word">that he lieth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "now that he is prostrate upon a sick-bed." <span class="cmt_word">He shall rise up no more</span>.

The devout soul is always athirst for God.

"Deep sorrow," as Hengstenberg remarks, "tries to lose itself in the recollection of the happier past." I pour out my soul in me. "The heart <span class="accented">pours itself out</span>, or melts in any one, who is in a manner dissolved by grief and pain." David does not alleviate his sorrow, but aggravates it, by thinking of the happy past.

For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. Another reading assimilates the refrain here to the form which it takes in ver. 11 and in <a href="../../par/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>. But, as Hengstenberg observes, Hebrew poets, and indeed poets generally, avoid an absolute identity of phrase, even in refrains (see <a href="../../par/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4, 11</a>, etc.).

God has recently dealt with Israel exceptionally - has seemed to "cast them off," has "put them to shame," allowed them to be defeated and despoiled, slain and carried into captivity, made a scorn and a derision, a reproach and a byword. He no longer "goes forth with their armies," to secure them victory over their foes, but holds aloof, and covers them with confusion. The description implies, not a single defeat, but a somewhat prolonged period of depression, during which several "armies" have been beaten, several battles lost, multitudes slain, and great numbers carried away captive (ver. 11). Still, a general captivity, like the Babylonian, is certainly not spoken cf. The nation is as yet unconquered. It needs but a return of God's favour to turn the vanquished into the victors, and to replace shame by boasting. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast off</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and put us to shame</span> (see also ver. 16).

Israel has still "armies" at her disposal. It is therefore certainly not the early Maccabean period, nor the time of the expiring monarchy.

There are not many periods of Israelite history at which such a description could have been given without manifest untruth, and the time of David is certainly more suitable for it than almost any other.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant</span>.

The heathen hate them, and make war upon them, as worshippers of one exclusive God, Jehovah, and contemners of their many gods, whom they hold to be "no-gods."

God has always hitherto maintained the cause of his people, and given them victory over their enemies, unless they had fallen away from him (vers. 1-8). Now he has acted otherwise - he has allowed their enemies to triumph (vers. 9-16). And they have given him no reason for his desertion of them (vers. 17-22). Surely, if they call upon him, and plead their cause before him, he will relent, and come to their aid.

An Israelite would be sure that "he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps" (<a href="../../par/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>).

It has been argued that a description of the Messiah would not lay stress on his personal beauty. But in the Song of Songs the personal beauty of the bridegroom, whom so many critics regard as the Messiah, is a main point (<a href="../../par/songs/5-10.htm">Song of Solomon 5:10-16</a>). A perfect man, such as Messiah was to be, must needs be beautiful, at any rate with a beauty of expression. In calling his bridegroom "<span class="accented">fair beyond the sons of men</span>," the writer at once gives us to understand that he is not a mere man. Grace is poured into thy lips; rather, <span class="accented">grace is poured out on thy lips</span> (Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Kay). The gift of gracious expression and gracious speech has been poured upon him from on high (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/5-16.htm">Song of Solomon 5:16</a>, "His mouth is most sweet"). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</span> The gifts bestowed upon him show the Divine favor and blessing, which, once granted, are not capriciously withdrawn.

There is no "with" in the original. Some think his sword is called Messiah's "glory and majesty." Others supply "put on," as implied in the "gird" of the first clause, and translate, "Put on thy glory and thy majesty;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> show thyself in all the majesty and glory that naturally belong to thee. This is quite in accordance with the context.

So the LXX., the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), the Chaldee paraphrase, and, among critics, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and Canon Cook. The renderings proposed by Gesenius, Ewald, and the anti-Messianic school generally are wholly untenable, as Hengstenberg has clearly shown. The psalmist's intention is to address the King, whom he has already declared to be more than man (ver. 2), as "God." <span class="cmt_word">Is for ever and ever</span>. A dominion to which there will never be any end. This is never said, and could not be truly said, of any earthly kingdom.

To this city he assigns a "river, the streams whereof make her glad;" imagery in which we may recognize the perennial fountain of God's grace - that "pure river of water of life," which, welling forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb, continually refreshes and gladdens the Church of Christ (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>), whether her dwell-tug-place be the earthly or the heavenly Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>).

The deliverance of Israel from Sennacherib came, it is to be remembered, when it was discovered "early in the morning" that in the camp of the Assyrians were 185,000 "dead corpses" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>).

As a general rule, God requires man to cooperate with him. "We are fellow-workers with God." "Aide-toi, le ecel t'aidera." But there are occasions when man must stand aloof, and all must be left to the almighty Disposer of all things. The invasion of Sennacherib was such an occasion. Human effort could not but be futile; and unless God gave deliver-ante in some strange and extraordinary way, there was no hope of escape: Judaea must cease to exist as an independent country. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">will</span> <span class="cmt_word">be exalted among the heathen.</span> When a deliverance was plainly miraculous, the God of Israel got him special honour among the neighbouring heathen nations, who could not gainsay the fact that there had been a supernatural interposition (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4, 17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will be exalted in the earth</span>.

When the occasion is such as to call for a public manifestation of thanksgiving at the house of God (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>), then he "goes up" also "with the sound of the trumpet," which was always sounded by the priests on great occasions of festal joy and gladness (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).

Jehoshaphat had solemnly praised God for the deliverance from the Moabites and Ammonites, both in the valley of Berachah, when he came upon the bodies of the slain (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-26.htm">2 Chronicles 20:26</a>), and in the temple after his return to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the city of our God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/101-8.htm">Psalm 101:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the mountain of his holiness.</span> The "holy hill of Zion" (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>), on which the temple and a great part of the city stood.

"Jerusalem, above all other great capitals," says Professor Cheyne, "is a mountain city." "It is a glorious burst," says Canon Tristram, "as the traveller rounds the shoulder of Mount Olivet, and the Haram wall starts up before him from the deep gorge of the Kedron, with its domes and crescents sparkling in the sunlight - a royal city" ('Land of Israel,' pp. 111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">The joy of the whole earth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zion</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>). The psalmist writes as a devout Israelite. To him there is nothing in the world so lovely, nothing so gladdening, as Mount Zion and the holy city seated on it. He does not mean to say that all the earth felt as he did; though he may have thought that, if men were wise, they would so feel. <span class="cmt_word">On the sides of the north</span>. Professor Cheyne regards this clause as a gloss which has crept into the text. Others give a mystical interpretation founded on <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>. But the simplest explanation seems to be the best. Zion, the city of David, lay to the north of the temple, and abutted on the city's northern wall. <span class="cmt_word">The city of the great King</span> (comp. ver. 1, "the city of our God").

Some see in these "kings" Sennacherib's princes, who, according to him (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>), were "altogether kings."

The literal exposition is wholly out of place, since history does not speak of any co-operation of a fleet with a land army in any attack upon Pales. fine. The expression must be used metaphorically of a great and violent destruction wrought by the arm of God upon Israel's foes. Still, the imagery would scarcely have been used, unless there had been something in the circumstances of the time to suggest it, as there certainly was in Jehoshaphat's time, whose fleet of "ships of Tamhish" was "broken" at Ezion-geber (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>).

But the psalm would end abruptly without the words, and the meaning, "he will be our Guide unto death," is quite satisfactory (so Hengstenberg and the Revised Version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/47.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 47"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 47" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/49.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 49"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 49" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/49.htm"><title>Psalm 49 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/49.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/49.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/49-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/48.htm" title="Psalm 48">&#9668;</a> Psalm 49 <a href="../psalms/50.htm" title="Psalm 50">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/49-1.htm">Psalm 49:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> Hear this, all <i>ye</i> people; give ear, all <i>ye</i> inhabitants of the world:</div><div class="comm">

The problem is propounded. On the one hand are the righteous, fallen upon evil days, surrounded by treacherous foes, ever on the watch to do them a mischief (ver. 5); on the other are the wicked, "trusting in their wealth, and boasting themselves in the multitude of their riches" (ver. 6), so opulent that they build houses which they expect to "continue for ever" and proprietors on such a scale that their lands are "called after their names" (ver. 11); and both parties equally short-lived, soon swept away from earth (vers. 10, 12). How is it that God allows all this, and how is man to reconcile himself to it? Simply by two reflections - one, that for the wicked, who have their portion in this life, there is no hope of happiness after death (vers. 14, 17); and the other that "God will redeem the righteous from the power of the grave, and will receive them" (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have I reason to fear, or may I trust in God's protection?

No one is redeemed from death, in the sense of escaping "the first death." Not only do "the fool and the brutish person" perish, but the fate of "the wise" is the same. All die; all quit the earth; all leave behind them everything that they possessed on earth; no one can take with him the gold in which he has trusted (ver. 6); <span class="cmt_word">all leave their wealth to others</span>.

Still, though they know this, the rich and worldly have an idea - an "inward thought"  - which they cherish, that they can m a certain sense escape death by founding families and leaving to their children substantial houses, which will keep up the family reputation, and accumulating landed estates, to which they may affix their name, so keeping their memories alive to future ages. <span class="cmt_word">They call their lands after their own names</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 4, 6, 22, 23, 29</a>, etc.; and compare the Greek traditions with respect to Hellen, Ion, Achaeus, Pelops, Cadmus, etc.).

Against these" inward thoughts" and outward actions, the psalmist simply maintains the ground already taken (ver. 10): "Man, in whatever honour he may be, abideth not" - has but a short time to live. He is like the beasts that perish. He has no more continuance than many of the beasts; like them, he passes from earth.

When they die they are "laid in the grave," or "ranged in Hades" (Kay), as sheep in a sheepfold. There is no escape for them. Death is their shepherd; he keeps them, watches over them, tends them, allows none to quit the fold. <span class="cmt_word">And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning</span>. When the resurrection morn comes - and no other explanation appears to be possible (see even Cheyne) - it will bring them no release; the righteous will then "have domination over them," and will certainly not set them free (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>). And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling; rather, <span class="accented">and their beauty is for Hades to consume out of its dwelling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its clay tenement (so Dr. Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a></div><div class="verse">But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave</span>. Here is the solution of the "dark saying," the key to the" parable." The souls of the righteous will be redeemed, not by themselves, but by God - they will be delivered "from the power of the grave," or rather of Hades; and, while the ungodly are held under by death and the grave (ver. 14), they will be released, and enter upon a higher life. <span class="cmt_word">For he shall receive me</span>. As God "took Enoch," when he "was not" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>) - took him to be with himself - so he will "receive" every righteous soul, and take it home, and give it rest and peace in his own dwelling-place. As Professor Cheyne observes, "It is the weakest of explanations to say that the psalmist rejoices thus in the prospect of mere deliverance from the danger of death. A few years later, and the prospect will return in a heightened form." The fact is that "the poet has that religious intuition which forms the kernel of the hope of immortality." At the same time, we may admit, as Hupfeld argues, that the belief in immortality is "not here stated as a revealed doctrine, but as a presentiment, a deep inward conviction, inseparable from real living faith in a living God."

Ver. 16 is a categorical answer to the doubt propounded in ver. 5. Vers. 17-19 are an echo of ver. 14, and at the same time a counterpoise to the views put forth in vers. 6, 11. Ver. 20 is a repetition, but with an important modification, of ver. 12. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich</span> (see vers. 5, 6). There is no ground for fear, nor even for perplexity, when the wicked grow rich and prosper. Their wealth will not ransom their souls (vers. 7-9). They cannot take it with them to another world (ver. 17). They will have no advantage from it there. On the contrary, their misery in another world will be such as to far outweigh any enjoyment which they may have had on earth (vers. 14, 19). <span class="cmt_word">When the glory of his house is increased</span> (see ver. 11).

Nothing in the way of earthly possessions - nothing but the qualities which he has imprinted on his soul, and made part and parcel of himself. The heathen nations, foolishly, were accustomed to bury clothes, and arms, and vessels, and stores of gold with the departed, as though they could take these with them into the other world (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. pp. 59-62, end notes 9, 1, 2). The writer of the psalm, and those whom he addressed, were equally aware of the foolishness of such customs. <span class="cmt_word">His glory shall not descend after him.</span> Whatever "glory" his wealth has secured to him in this life shall be left behind. He shall be imprisoned in Sheol, with death to shepherd him (ver. 14), and with no hope of returning to the "light" (ver. 19).

Not only do such men congratulate themselves, but the world's applause follows on them.

"Sons of men " - <span class="accented">beney ish</span> - is not a mere periphrasis for "men." It is a title of some honour and dignity.

The phrase is rather equivalent to our "sirs" ('Speaker's Commentary.'). <span class="cmt_word">How long will ye turn my glory into shame?</span> By your misconduct. See the clause which follows.

The godly man is not contaminated by the evil doings of those who associate with him, and profess to act in his interest, if he neither authorizes nor condones their conduct. David had protested against Joab's proceedings on one occasion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28</a>), and never at any time pardoned them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5, 6</a>).

Sacrifices of victims are scarcely meant; certainly not, if the time of the composition is that of David's exile, since victims could be offered nowhere but at Jerusalem. We may suppose a reference to those sacrifices which are most truly "sacrifices of righteousness," vie. "a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart," which God "will not despise" (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a><span class="cmt_word">).

Among David's adherents in his times of distress (ver. 1) would be many who doubted and desponded, anticipating nothing but continued suffering and misfortune. Theft would ask the question of the text. Or the scope may be wider. Men are always seeking for good, but not knowing what their true good is. David points it out to them. It is to have the light of God's countenance shining on them. Lord, lift thou up, etc.; compare the form of Levitical benediction (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>), and see also <a href="../../par/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3, 7, 19</a>.

David is an example to the de-spending ones. Notwithstanding his sufferings and calamities, God has looked on him, and so "put gladness in his heart" - a gladness which far exceeds that of his adversaries. Though they are in prosperity, and have their corn and wine increased, and enjoy all the "outward material blessings  promised to Israel - the wheat and the grape - for a supply of which he is indebted to the generosity of friends" (Kay), yet he would not change places with them. The spiritual joy which fills his own heart is preferable to any amount of material comforts and pleasures.

He seeks his couch, and <span class="accented">at once</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>) slumber visits him. No anxious thoughts keep him tossing on his bed for hours<span class="cmt_word">. For thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety</span>. David has a satisfaction in thinking that it is God only who watches over him. All other help would be vain, superfluous. God alone brought Israel through the wilderness (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>); God alone established Israel in Canaan (<a href="../../par/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2, 3</a>).

The strong and prolonged depreciation of sacrifice (vers. 8-13) necessarily implies that in the religion of the time too much stress was laid upon it. We know that, in the heathen world, men sought to buy God's favour by their sacrifices, some] believing that, physically, the gods were nourished by the steam of the victims, others regarding them as laid under obligations which they could not disregard (Plato, 'Rep.,' it. &sect; 6; Rawlinson, 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 124, 125). We know, too, that, in the later monarchy, sacrifice to so great an extent superseded true spiritual worship among the Israelites themselves, that it became an offence to God, and was spoken of in terms of reprobation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>).

It has been hitherto for the first step in justification - the wiping out of past transgressions. It is now for restoration, for a renewal of spiritual life, for a return to God's favour, and to the spiritual joy involved in it. First, however, an additional confession is made (vers. 5, 6). Not only have I committed acts of sin (vers. 1-4), but sin is thoroughly ingrained into my nature. I was conceived in it; I was brought forth in it; only the strongest remedies can cleanse me from it (ver. 7). But cleansing alone is not enough. I need renewal (ver. 10); I need thy Holy Spirit (ver. 11); I crave, above all, the sense of a restoration to thy favour - a return to the old feelings of "joy and gladness" (ver. 8), even "the joy of thy salvation" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in iniquity was I brought forth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And in sin did my</span> <span class="cmt_word">mother conceive me.</span> It is doubtless true, as Professor Cheyne says, that "the Old Testament contains no theory of the origin of sin" - no formulated doctrine on the subject.

Legally, this was the hyssop, with its "blood of sprinkling" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6, 7</a>); spiritually, it was the blood of Christ, which was thus symbolized. <span class="cmt_word">Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</span> Again the word is used which corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Compare the Christian doctrine of the "new birth" and "new life." <span class="cmt_word">And renew a right spirit within me.</span> "Heart" and "spirit" are used interchangeably for the inward essence of man; but, as Professor Cheyne observes, "Heart emphasizes the individual side of a man's life; spirit, its Divine, or at least preternatural side." David, in asking both for a new heart and a new spirit, requests the renovation of his entire mental and moral nature, which he recognizes as corrupt and depraved.

The psalmist deprecates so terrible a punishment, although he feels that he has deserved it<span class="cmt_word">. And take not thy Holy Spirit from me</span>. God's Holy Spirit had been poured upon David when he was first anointed by Samuel to the kingly office (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). His great sins had undoubtedly "grieved" and vexed the Spirit; and, had they been continued or not repented of, would have caused him to withdraw himself; but they had not "wholly quenched the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>). David was therefore able to pray, as he does, that the Holy Spirit of God might still be vouchsafed to him, and not be "taken away," as from one wholly unworthy.

If God will grant his petitions, restore him to favour, and renew his spiritual life, then he will make such return as is possible to him. First, he will teach transgressors God's ways (ver. 13). Next, he will extol his righteousness, and show forth his praise(vers. 14, 15). Finally, he will offer him, not bloody sacrifice, but the sacrifice in which he delights - "the sacrifice of a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart" (vers. 16, 17). Such sacrifice, he is sure, God will not despise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then will I teach transgressors thy ways</span>. The truly grateful heart cannot be satisfied without making some return to God for his goodness. The most satisfactory return is by deeds, not words.

As Hammond observes, "The Mosaical Law allows no reconciliation, no sacrifice, for such sins." <span class="cmt_word">Thou delightest not in burnt offering.</span> In the mere act of sacrifice - the untimely slaying of his own creatures - God could at no time have had any pleasure.

The chief ground for the supposition is the prayer in ver. 18, "Build thou the walls of Jerusalem," which has been supposed to imply that the walls were in ruins, whereas under David they should have been, it is thought, in good condition. But it has been pointed out, very justly, that the fortifications of Jerusalem were not complete in David's time, and that both he and Solomon added considerably to them (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 19</a>). David may well have thought that, as a punishment for his sin, God might interfere with the work which he was doing for the benefit of his people, and hence have felt it needful to pray, "Do good unto Zion: build thou the wails of Jerusalem." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion</span>. It is characteristic of David to pass from prayer for himself to prayer for the people committed to him, and especially to do so at or near the end of a psalm (see <a href="../../par/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-22.htm">Psalm 25:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-16.htm">Psalm 40:16</a>).

In conclusion, the psalmist contrasts his own condition, as one of God's people, with that of Doeg, which he had described in vers. 7-9. Doeg is about to be "plucked up" and "rooted out of the land of the living" (ver. 5); he is like a flourishing green olive tree planted in the sanctuary, or "house of God." Doeg is entirely without any trust in the Almighty (ver. 7); he declares of himself, <span class="cmt_word">I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever</span>. It is questioned whether olive trees were at any time planted in the courts of either the tabernacle or the temple; but it certainly cannot be proved that they were not. In the courts of Egyptian temples trees were abundant (Herod., 2:138; Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 236), also probably in Phoenician temples (Perrot and Chipiez, ' Histoire de l'Art dans l'An-tiquite,' vol. 3. p. 322).

The attacks of his enemies (ver. 3) deeply grieve and pain the heart of the psalmist. It is not as if they were foreigners, whose hostility was to be expected. They are his own countrymen; one of them is his own familiar friend (ver. 12). Yet they threaten his life. And the terrors of death are fallen upon ms. When a king is the object of a conspiracy, he well knows, especially in the East, that nothing but his death will satisfy the conspirators. So on David, long before he made up his mind to quit Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>), the "terrors of death" must have fallen.

Where the expectation of a life beyond the grave was so dim and shadowy as in Judaea at this time, the "horror" of death would be the greater.

Great composers have set to it some of their most exquisite music. The desire is one which finds an echo in almost every human breast, and the expression of it here has all the beauty of the best Eastern poetry. Jeremiah's words are far tamer, "Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them!" <span class="cmt_word">For then would</span> <span class="cmt_word">I fly away, and be at rest.</span> The desire of "rest" is universal. Whatever the delights of action, they can only charm us for a time. In our hearts we are always longing to have done with action, and to be at rest.

Speaking of a rocky gorge near the Lake of Gennesaret, Canon Tristram says, "But no description can give an adequate idea of the myriads of rock-pigeons. In absolute crowds they dashed to and fro in the ravine, whirling round with a rush and a whirr that could be felt like a gust of <span class="accented">wind"</span> ('Land of Israel,' p. 446).

As doves fly from storm and tempest to their nests in the rocks, so the psalmist would fain haste away from the passions and perils of the city to some safe refuge in the wilds. What he here anticipates, he afterwards accomplished, when he fled from Absalom over Jordan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a></div><div class="verse">Destroy, O Lord, <i>and</i> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-15.</span> - With a sudden transition, the writer passes from his own suffering, fears, and longings, to imprecations on his enemies, and a description of their wicked proceedings. In the course of his description he singles out one individual for special remark - one who had been his own guide, companion, and friend - but who had turned against him, and joined the company of his adversaries (vers. 12-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues</span>. The second clause contains a reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>). "Introduce confusion into their counsels, and disperse them, as thou didst with the wicked ones who were forced to leave off to build the Tower." <span class="cmt_word">For I have seen violence and strife in the city</span>.

Even Professor Cheyne allows this, and suggests that we have here Jeremiah inveighing against Pashur. But the general sentiment of commentators has always been that Ahithophel is intended. And, if we allow the psalm to be David's, we can scarcely give any other explanation. Ahithophel was known as "David's counsellor" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his chief adviser, his "grand vizier," his "prime minister? What he counselled was considered as a sort of "oracle of God" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). His defection was the bitterest drop in the cup of the unhappy king. Anything else he "could have borne;" but this was too much. Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me. It was not one among my professed and open enemies  - not one of those whose hatred I had long known and reckoned on. Then I would have hid myself from him. Instead of opening all my heart to him, as I have done to Ahithophel.

As this strophe begins (ver. 9), so it ends, with an imprecation. The psalmist calls on God to bring destruction upon the whole mass <span class="cmt_word">of</span> his enemies. Of the two readings in the original, the one adopted by our translators seems the best, "Let death come suddenly upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Let them go down quick</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">alive</span>) into hell. There is an allusion to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), who "went down quick into the pit;" but probably the psalmist neither expected nor desired a literal fulfilment of his imprecation. The deaths of Ahithophel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>) and Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14, 15</a>), and of so many of Absalom's followers (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7, 8</a>), were quite a sufficient fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</span> (comp. vers. 3, 9-11).

Still grieved chiefly by the defection of his unfaithful friend, he once more describes the treachery and heinousness of his conduct (vers. 20. 21), before winding up with a word of comfort for all the righteous (ver. 22), and of menace against all the ungodly (ver. 23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">shall save me.</span> The call is upon the God known to man by nature as the Almighty Ruler of the universe; the answer is from the covenant God of Israel, the Self-existent One, in whom Israel trusts.

From this passage and from Daniel's conduct (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>) we learn that devout Israelites habitually offered prayer to God at these three times of the day. The "morning "<span class="accented">and</span> "evening" devotions were doubtless suggested by the law of the morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>); but the midday prayer, being nowhere commanded, can only be ascribed to natural piety. And he shall hear my voice. Constant unremitting prayer is certain of an answer. Compare the parable of the importunate friend (<a href="../../par/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-8</a>).

Dr. Kay, "Before your caldrons have felt the thorn fire, even as raw flesh, even so, shall hot fury sweep him away."

According to this, the meaning is, "Thou hast indeed given a banner to them that fear thee (see <a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>), but only that they may flee before the bow" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1ffd;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.).

Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a "reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours," and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) and the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>). If these assurances are to be depended on, Israel cannot now be about to succumb to Edom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God hath spoken in his holiness;</span> or, <span class="accented">promised by his holiness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>).

And this is certainly true. But it is to be remembered that he views his enemies, not merely as his own fees, but as the foes of God and of Israel. As the servant of God, he must hate those who are opposed to God; as the King of Israel, he must hate those who seek to injure and ruin his people. He does not, however, desire for them suffering or torment; he only asks that they may be removed from this sphere into another world.

And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. Among the peculiar privileges, one of the greatest was that of approaching God's presence in his holy temple, and entering his "courts" and worshipping there. This all Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to do, at least three times in the year, while the dwellers in Jerusalem, privileged above the rest, had constant opportunities of attending, and using to the full the means of grace provided for them in the sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. In "the goodness of God's house" the psalmist includes, not only the delights there experienced, but also all the blessings which God gives to those who devoutly worship him there - "from the forgiveness of sins to outward, temporal mercies" (Hengstenberg).

According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now "comes at last to the point aimed at from the first." He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the "early rain" descending from "the river of God," or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (<a href="../../par/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). After that, the "latter rain" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the "long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills," covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. <a href="../../par/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).

As the writer ascribes to himself both the making of the vows and the offering of the sacrifices, he must have been the leader of the nation at the time of the oppression and of the deliverance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O bless our God, ye people;</span> literally, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span> - but the plural form here can scarcely point to the "nations," who have just been called, not '<span class="accented">ammim</span>, but <span class="accented">goim</span> (see ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And make the voice of his praise to be heard</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; cf. 5).

In the old world the strict performance of vows was always held to be one of the main obligations of religion. A vow was of the nature of a compact with God, and to break it was an act of flagrant dishonesty, from which men shrank. The Mosaic Law sanctioned vows of various kinds, as the vowing of children to the service of God (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-1.htm">Leviticus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>); the vow of the Nazarite (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2-21</a>); and vows of clean or unclean animals (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-9.htm">Leviticus 27:9-13, 27-29</a>), etc. Clean animals, when vowed, must be either redeemed or sacrificed. The importance of performing vows is borne frequent witness to by the psalmists (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/65-1.htm">Psalm 65:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2</a>).

It has been because his prayers and vows proceeded from a sincere and honest heart, one which was free from "iniquity" (ver. 18). As Hengstenberg points out, this portion of the psalm is didactic, and inculcates the lesson "that there is no way of salvation except that of well doing." God, by answering the psalmist's prayer, and giving the deliverance for which he had entreated, had set his testimony to the fact of the psalmist's integrity (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come and hear, all ye that fear God.</span> The address is scarcely to all that have any sense of religion anywhere, as Professor Cheyne suggests, but rather to the religious section of his own nation - the "righteous" or "godly" of other psalms. They are invited to draw near, and be received into the psalmist's confidence. <span class="cmt_word">And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</span> What God had done for the psalmist was to give him confidence and assurance. He knew that his prayers would be ineffectual unless his heart was pure. God heard him, and then he became sure that he was free from the "great transgression" (Cheyne).

A sudden transition, and perhaps a quotation from an ancient poem. The special object of the psalmist's  thought is not Bashan, but Mount Zion; and what he is about to celebrate is Jehovah's choice of Mount Zion for his dwelling place, and his establishment on it. But he prefers to introduce the subject by a contrast with the <span class="accented">great</span> range of Canaan. Bashan, he says, is truly "a mountain of God" - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a very great mountain (see the comment on Psalm 36:6) - "one which seemed in an especial degree to show forth creative power."

This is described as a host of chariots (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) -twenty thousand in number, and "thousands of repetition" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">is among them;</span> or, "in their midst." <span class="cmt_word">As in Sinai, in the holy place;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Sinai is in the sanctuary</span>.

Now we have a description of God's "goings in the sanctuary" (ver. 24). Some critics suppose a particular occasion to be pointed at; but the expression "goings" rather indicates something habitual, or, at any rate, recurring.

The psalmist begins by deprecating God's wrath and displeasure.

Bodily ailment seems certainly to be implied; but it is that sort of bodily ailment which is often produced by mental distress - a general languor, weariness, and distaste for exertion (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3</a>).

Clearly the main emphasis is intended to be laid on the mental suffering. But thou, O Lord, how long! We may fill up the ellipse in various ways: "How long wilt thou look on?" "How long wilt thou hide thyself?" "How long wilt thou be angry?" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a>).

The general view of the psalmists seems to have been that death was a cessation of the active service of God - whether for a time or permanently, they do not make clear to us. So even Hezekiah, in the passage of Isaiah above quoted. Death is represented as a sleep (<a href="../../par/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>), but whether there is an awakening from it does not appear. No doubt, as has been said ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 182), "the cessation of active service, even of remembrance or devotion, does not affect the question of a future restoration," and the metaphor of sleep certainly suggests the idea of an awakening. But such a veil hung over the other world, under the old dispensation, and over the condition of the departed in it, that thought was scarcely exercised upon the subject. Men's duties in this life were what occupied them, and they did not realize that in another they would have employments - much less form any notion of what those employments would be.

The kind of grief expressed by the word <span class="accented">ka'as</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>) is "that which arises from provocation or spiteful treatment" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">It waxeth old because of all mine enemies</span>. It becomes dull and heavy and sunken, like the eye of an old man. How often has it not been noted that nothing so much ages a man as grief! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity!</span> Note the sudden change of tone, very characteristic of the Davidical psalms. The psalmist, having offered his prayer, is so certain of its acceptance that he at once turns upon his adversaries with words of reproach, and almost of menace. "Depart from me!" he exclaims; "get ye gone! do not dare any more to persecute me or plot against me! Your efforts are in vain." <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping</span>. David speaks from an inward conviction. He knows that he has prayed sincerely and fervently. He is certain, therefore, that his prayer is heard and accepted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive</span> - rather, <span class="accented">hath received</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">my prayer</span>. The threefold repetition marks the absoluteness of the psalmist's conviction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return <i>and</i> be ashamed suddenly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed</span> (Rosenmuller, Kay, and others). Shame will fall upon David's enemies when their plots have failed, and deep vexation when they find him restored to health (ver. 4) and in the full enjoyment of the Divine favour. Lot them return; rather, <span class="accented">they shall return</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "retire...  turn their backs," "take to flight." As Hengstenberg says, "David sees his enemies, who are gathered around him for the attack, all at once in alarm give way." And be ashamed suddenly. It is doubly shameful to have to fly when one has been the assailant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/70.htm"><title>Psalm 70 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/70.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/70.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/70-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/69.htm" title="Psalm 69">&#9668;</a> Psalm 70 <a href="../psalms/71.htm" title="Psalm 71">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/70-1.htm">Psalm 70:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, to bring to remembrance.>> <i>Make haste</i>, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Make haste, <span class="cmt_word">O God, to deliver me.</span> In <a href="../../par/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a> we find, "<span class="accented">Be pleased</span>, O Lord, to deliver me;" and this would seem to be the right way of supplying the ellipse here. <span class="cmt_word">Make haste to help me, O Lord.</span>

The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16).

To envy the wicked because they prosper is to make more account of the good things of this life than of God's favour - to prefer physical good to moral. It is also to doubt that God governs the universe by the strict rule of justice. The word translated "foolish" means rather, "vain arrogant boasters."

The Prayer book Version inserts, between this verse and the last, the words, "and I said;" which is correct, though somewhat free, exegesis. Compare with the expression, "I have washed my hands in innocency," Job's remarkable words, "If I wash myself with snow, and make my hands never so clean" (<a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>).

The three subdivisions of beth the tabernacle and the first temple, viz. the court, the holy place, and the holy of holies, constituted three sanctuaries. The psalmist, in his perplexity, took his doubts into the sanctuary of God, and there, "in the calmness of the sacred court" (Kay), reconsidered the hard problem. Compare Hezekiah's action with the perplexing letter of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>).

They are a "set in slippery places" - places from which they may easily slip and fall. <span class="cmt_word">Thou castedst them down to destruction.</span> The fall often comes, even in this life. The flourishing cities of the plain are destroyed by fire from heaven; Pharaoh's land is ruined by the plagues, and his host destroyed in the Red Sea; Sennacherib's army perishes in a night; Jezebel is devoured by dogs; Athaliah is slain with the sword; Antiochus Epiphanes perishes in a distant expedition; Herod Agrippa is eaton of worms; persecutors, like Nero, Galerius, Julian, come to untimely ends. A signal retribution visits the wicked in hundreds and thousands of instances. When it does not, the question remains - Is death the end? This point is not formally brought forward, but it underlies the whole argument; and, unless retribution after death be regarded as certain, a single exception to the general rule of retribution in this life would upset the solution which the psalmist finds satisfactory.

The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into "perpetual ruins" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to "make havoc" of Israel "altogether;" and the enemy have spread themselves, and "burnt up all the houses of God in the land" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the time of the invasion of Shishak; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of the Babylonian conquest; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the early Maceabean period, or the reign of Judas Maccabaens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of the first is the ascription of the psalm in the "title" to Asaph. But all other considerations are against it. There is no evidence that Shishak ever entered Jerusalem. He certainly did not break down the carved work of the temple, or set the temple on fire, much less "cast it down to the ground." His invasion was a mere raid, and Rehoboam seems to have bought his retreat by the sacrifice of the temple treasury (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-12</a>). The circumstances described in the psalm are also unsuitable to the reign of Judas Maccabaeus, in whose time the temple suffered desecration at the hands of the Syrians, but was not seriously damaged, much less demolished. Thus the only date suitable for the composition of the psalm is that immediately following the capture of the city under Nebuchadnezzar.  We must explain the "title" by the consideration that Asaph, like Jeduthun and Heman, became a tribe name, attaching to all the descendants of the original Asaph, and was equivalent to "sou of Asaph" (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-44.htm">Nehemiah 7:44</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>). The psalm consists of three portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A complaint to God, including a description of all the horrors of the situation (vers. 1-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> An enumeration of God's mercies in the olden time, as a foundation for hope that he will yet rescue Israel (vers. 12-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An earnest prayer for relief and restoration, and the re-establishment of the covenant (vers. 18-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O God, why hast thou cast us off forever?</span> It could only have been in the extremity of distress that a devout Israelite believed, even for a time, that Israel was "<span class="accented">cast off forever"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, which must have been written nearly at the same period as this). <span class="cmt_word">Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span> God's anger "smokes" when it is hot and furious (see <a href="../../par/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>).

Hence the complete destruction of the city and temple (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1-9</a>, etc.); hence the deportation of all the  <span class="accented">strength</span> of the nation (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and their settlement in the far off region of Babylonia; hence the desolation, not only of Jerusalem, but of "all the habitations of Jacob" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>), all the "strongholds of the daughter of Judah" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span> The synagogue system was first introduced by Ezra, according to Jewish tradition; and it has been argued that the mention of "synagogues" here - literally, "sacred meeting places" - proves the psalm to be Maccabean. But meeting places for worship, other than the temple, always existed in Palestine, both before and after its erection. Mesha speaks of having plundered a "house of Jehovah" in his war with Ahab ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11:p. 167); and it is plain from <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a> that religious meetings were held by the prophets, probably in houses devoted to the purpose, during the period of the divided monarchy. Hezekiah's destruction of the high places (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) is not likely to have interfered with the use of these buildings, to which no savour of idolatry can have attached in the mind of the most violent iconoclast. I should therefore believe, with Leopold Low, that buildings existed before the Exile, in which religious instruction was given by authorized teachers.

There is <span class="cmt_word">no more any prophet</span>. It has been said that this shows the psalm not to have been written on the occasion of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, since Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were, all of them, then living. But the writer only means to say that there are no prophets in Palestine, where he is residing. Jeremiah in Egypt, Ezekiel on the banks of Chebar, Daniel in Babylon, are nothing to him, even if he knows of their existence, and in no way fill up the gap whereof he complains. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there among us any who knoweth how long.</span> Jeremiah's prophecy of the seventy years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>) did net remove the doubt, since it was uncertain from what event the seventy years were to be counted. Jeremiah's prophecies, moreover, were not yet, in all probability, collected into a volume, and so may not have been known to the psalmist.

The deliverance from Egypt has the foremost place (vers. 13,14), as the most striking. Then the deliverance from the wilderness, and the passage of Jordan (ver. 15).

"Salem" is the <span class="accented">peaceful</span> place, the place where God's presence breathed peace and tranquillity.

Sennacherib's untimely death (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) followed not many years after the destruction of his host, in which there must have been many "princes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/75.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 75"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 75" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/77.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 77"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 77" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/psalms/77.htm"><title>Psalm 77 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/psalms/77.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/psalms/77.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/psalms/77-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../psalms/76.htm" title="Psalm 76">&#9668;</a> Psalm 77 <a href="../psalms/78.htm" title="Psalm 78">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/77-1.htm">Psalm 77:1</a></div><div class="verse"><<To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.>> I cried unto God with my voice, <i>even</i> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice.</span> The repetition marks the intensity of the appeal, "with my voice" - that the appellant is not content with mere silent prayer. <span class="cmt_word">And he gave ear unto me;</span> rather, "that he may hearken unto me" (Cheyne), or "and do thou hearken unto me" (Hengstenberg, Kay).

But most commentators see in the passage a most essential portion of the poem. It is the thought of the deliverance from Egypt that especially sustains and comforts the psalmist in his extreme distress. The passage is prepared for by vers. 11 and 14, and is exegetical of ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">They were afraid.</span> They shrank from the sight of God, and made a way for his people to pass over. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">depths also were troubled</span>.

A storm of wind usually accompanies thunder and lightning.

This is believed to accompany every thunderstorm, though generally invisible to the eye.

If accepted, it must be considered as a reference to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-7.htm">1 Samuel 24:7</a>, or else to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>, or both, and as a sort of parenthetic protest, "Nay, not only have I not injured a friend, but I have gone so far as to let my enemy escape me." A different meaning is, however, given to the passage by many critics, as Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, etc., who regard the sense as running on without any parenthesis, and translate, "If I have oppressed him who without cause is mine enemy." David, according to this view, denies that he has either injured a friend or requited evil to a foe.

To call on him to "arise in <span class="accented">his anger"</span> is to entreat him to vindicate our cause against those opposed in us, and to visit them with some open manifestation of his displeasure (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lift up thyself</span>.

Force must be met by force. David justifies his appeal for aid by alleging the violence and fury of those whose attacks he has to meet<span class="cmt_word">. And awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</span> The two clauses are not connected in the original, which runs, "Awake for me: thou hast commanded judgment."

He adopts the figure of a vine, perhaps suggested to him by the description of Joseph in the dying speech of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>), and carries out his metaphor, in nine consecutive verses, with great beauty and consistency. Isaiah's description of Israel as a vineyard (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) is somewhat similar. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt</span>. The history of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> begins with the Exodus. The nation was transplanted from Egypt into a soil better fitted for it by the loving hand of God, in order that it might have ample room to grow up and develop itself freely. God "brought it out of Egypt," not merely in the exercise of his ordinary providence over humanity, but by an active exertion of his Almighty power, and a long series of miraculous manifestations, without which the transfer could not have been effected. He then cast out the heathen, and planted it - drove out, that is, before Israel the seven nations of the Hivites, Hittites, Gergashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Jebusites, and, having driven them out, "planted" in his own people (see <a href="../../par/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>).

It is difficult to trace any connection between these concluding verses. They appear to consist of distinct thoughts, which arise in the writer's mind, and are jotted down as they occur to him. One is a thought of loyalty, which finds vent in a prayer for the king (ver. 9). Another is a reflection of the main thought of the psalm, the incomparable blessedness of dwelling in God's house. A third (vers. 11, 12) is the joy and glory of perpetual communion with God and trust in God. See the remarks of Professor Cheyne ('The Book of Psalms,' p. 237). <span class="cmt_word">I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">at the</span> <span class="accented">threshold</span>; but the meaning is well expressed by the Authorized Version.

This was so vast a boon, that a pause for devout acknowledgment and silent adoration seemed fitting. Hence the "selah," which is at the end of the second verse, not of the first, as Hengstenberg states.

Israel is still in a state of great distress and weakness, suffering from the natural consequences of its sins, which keep it depressed and sad. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn us, O God of our salvation.</span> Thou art turned to us (ver. 1); let us also be turned to thee.

The psalmist anticipates a favourable answer to his prayer, and proceeds to note down the chief points of it. God will "speak peace to his people" (ver. 8), bring his salvation near to them (ver. 9), contrive a way by which "mercy and truth," "righteousness and peace," shall be reconciled (vers. 10, 11), shower blessings on his land (ver. 12), and guide his people in the way marked out by his own footsteps (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will hear what God the Lord will speak;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will wait now and hear the Divine answer to my prayers" (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>, "I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me"). <span class="cmt_word">For he will speak peace unto his people.</span> He will give them a gentle answer - one breathing peace and loving kindness. <span class="cmt_word">And to his saints.</span> And especially he will so answer the <span class="accented">elite</span> of his people - the <span class="accented">khasidim</span>, "his saints," or "loving ones." <span class="cmt_word">But let them not turn again to folly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10-14</a>).

The word <span class="accented">rephaim</span> designates the wan, shadowy ghosts that have gone down to Hades (Sheol), and are resting there.

He is not yet a mere shade, an inhabitant of Sheol; he is in the flesh, upon the earth; he can still cry, and does still cry, to Jehovah. There is thus still a faint gleam of hope for him. <span class="cmt_word">And in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</span> The psalmist will draw out God's mercy, as it were, before its time, by importuning him with early and continual prayer (comp. vers. 1, 9).

What has he done to be "cast off"? He is evidently not aware of having sinned any grievous sin, and does not understand why he is visited with such grievous sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">Why hidest thou thy face from me?</span> Perhaps it is his insensibility, his unconsciousness of real sins and shortcomings, that has drawn down upon the psalmist his chastisement.

This is a new point. The psalmist's afflictions have not come upon him recently. He does not merely mean, as some have supposed, that, like other men, as soon as he was born he began to die, but speaks of something, if not absolutely peculiar to himself, yet at any rate rare and abnormal - a long continuance in a dying state, such as could only have been brought about by some terribly severe malady. <span class="cmt_word">While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I have endured thy terrors</span>; <span class="accented">I am exhausted.</span> (On the endurance of God's "terrors," see <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>.)

God's promise to David is the entire foundation of the psalmist's hope and confidence. He therefore places it briefly in the very forefront - afterwards expanding it into the beautiful passage, which forms more than one-third of the entire composition (vers. 19-37). <span class="cmt_word">I have sworn unto David my servant</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>).

After Zerubbabel, no prince of the Davidic house sat on the throne of David, or had temporal sway over Israel. The descendants of David sank into obscurity, and so remained for five centuries. Still, however, God's faithfulness was sure. In Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, the true King of the <span class="accented">everlasting</span> kingdom was raised up - every pledge made to David was fulfilled. "Messiah the Prince," eternal King of an eternal kingdom, appeared as the true "Seed' intended, and began his spiritual reign over the spiritual Israel, which still continues, and will continue forever.

His song of praise divides into two portions. From ver. 5 to ver. 18 it is a general laudation of the Almighty for his greatness in heaven (vers. 5-7), in nature (vers. 9, 11, 12), and in the course of his rule on earth (vers. 10, 13-18), after which it passes into a laudation of him in respect of what he had done, and what he had promised, to David (vers. 19-37). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord.</span> "The heavens" here are not the material heavens, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. l, but the company of the dwellers in heaven.

As David is here the mouthpiece of humanity, praising God for mercies common to all men, he uses the plural pronoun instead of the singular one<span class="cmt_word">. How excellent is thy Name in all the earth!</span> or, "How <span class="accented">glorious</span> is thy Name!" (Kay, Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Who hast set thy glory above the heavens</span>. It is difficult to obtain this sense from the present Hebrew text; but some corruption of the text is suspected.

By "babes and sucklings" are meant young children just able to lisp God's praises, and often doing so, either through pious teaching or by a sort of natural instinct, since "Heaven lies about us in our infancy" (Wordsworth). These scarce articulate mutterings form a foundation on which the glory of God in part rests. <span class="cmt_word">Because of thine enemies</span>. To put them to shame, who, having attained to manhood, refuse to acknowledge God. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mightset still the enemy and the avenger</span>. It scarcely seems as if any single individual - either Absalom, or Ahithophel, or even Satan (Kay) - is intended. Rather the words are used generally of all those who are enemies of God, and desirous of revenging themselves upon him. The existence of such persons is well shown by Hengstenberg.

David, in his shepherd-life, had had abundant opportunity of "considering the heavens," and had evidently scanned them with the eye of a poet and an intense admirer of nature. It is probably in remembrance of the nights when he watched his father's flock, that he makes no mention of the sun, but only of "the moon and the stars." <span class="cmt_word">The work of thy fingers</span>; and therefore "thy heavens." Often as the "hand of God" is mentioned in Scripture, it is but very rarely that we hear of his "<span class="accented">finger"</span> or "<span class="accented">fingers."</span> So far as I am aware, the only places are <a href="../../par/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>; and <a href="../../par/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>).

He is not, like Job, impatient of God's constant observation (<a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-20</a>), but simply filled with wonder at his marvellous condescension (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). And the son of man, that thou visitest him? The "son of man" here is a mere variant for "man" in the preceding hemistich. The clause merely emphasizes the general idea.

There is no place in the Old Testament where <span class="accented">Elohim</span> means "angels;" and, though the LXX. so translate in the present passage, and the rendering has passed from them into the New Testament (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>), it cannot be regarded as critically correct. The psalmist, in considering how man has been favoured by God, goes back in thought to his creation, and remembers the words of <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26, 27</a>, "Let us make man <span class="accented">in our own image</span>, <span class="accented">after our likeness</span>...

By these words man's right of dominion was established. His actual dominion only came, and still comes, by degrees.

But his words are not beyond those which are natural to one of warm poetic temperament and deep natural piety, looking out upon the world and upon man as they existed in his day. Inspiration, of which we know so little, may perhaps have guided him to the choice of words and phrases peculiarly applicable to "the Ideal of man's nature and true Representative, Christ;" and hence the many references to this psalm in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-16.htm">Matthew 21:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6-8</a>), and in this sense the psalm may be Messianic; but it is certainly not one of those, like <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>. and <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, where the author consciously spoke of another time than his own, and of a Personage whom he knew only by faith.

"By a sudden and effective transition," as Professor Cheyne remarks, "Jehovah becomes the speaker" of the concluding strophe.

The Mosaic Law provided for it by the establishment of the morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38, 39</a>), with the accompanying ritual. Jewish piety added a noonday prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), and Christian zeal established the "seven hours of prayer."

Thou hast destroyed the wicked; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst destroy.</span> Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. If taken literally, this should mean extermination, and so some explain (Hengstenberg, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'); but some allowance must be made for the use of hyperbole by a poet. None of the nations with which David contended suffered extinction or extermination.

It is better to translate, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">The enemy are come to an end</span>; <span class="accented">they are desolate for ever</span> - a continuance of the hyperbole already noticed in the preceding verse. And thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them; rather, <span class="accented">and as for the cities thou hast destroyed</span>, <span class="accented">their very memory has perished.</span> This could only be an anticipation. It was fulfilled in the complete disappearance from history of the names of Zoba, Beth-rehob, and Tob, after the victory described in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13, 14</a>.

David's use of the metaphor is reasonably ascribed to his having "often experienced safety in such places, when fleeing from Saul" (Hengstenberg; see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). A refuge in times of trouble; literally, <span class="accented">in times in trouble</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in times that are steeped in trouble" (Kay).

"To know the Name of God is to know him according to his historical manifestation; when one hears him named, to call to remembrance all that he has done. His name is the focus in which all the rays of his actions meet" (Hengstenberg). All who "know God's Name" in this sense will be sure to "put their trust in him," since his historical manifestation shows that he is thoroughly to he depended on. <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee</span>. Never in the past, so far as David knew, had God forsaken those who faithfully clung to him. They might be tried, like Job; they might be "hunted upon the mountains," like David himself; they might even have the sense of being forsaken (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>); but they were not forsaken nevertheless. God "forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing praises to the Lord</span>. Having praised God himself (vers. 1, 2), and declared the grounds upon which his praises rest (vers. 3-10), David now calls upon all faithful Israelites to join him in his song of thanksgiving. "Sing praises unto the Lord," he says, <span class="cmt_word">which dwelleth in Zion.</span> Who is enthroned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">on</span> the mercy-seat between the cherubim in the tabernacle, now set up upon Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-17</a>). The date of the psalm is thus to some extent limited, since it must have been composed subsequently to the transfer of the ark to Jerusalem. Declare among the people his doings.

David is possessed with the conviction that the revelation of God made to Israel is not to be confined to them, but through them to be communicated to "all the ends of the earth" - to the heathen at large, to all nations (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/66-4.htm">Psalm 66:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11, 19</a>, etc.).

He forgetteth not the cry of the humble; or, <span class="accented">the afflicted</span> (Kay, Cheyne). He comes to the aid of such persons, and avenges them on their enemies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i>which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy upon me, O Lord!</span> The consideration of God's mercies in the past, and especially in the recent deliverance, leads the psalmist to implore a continuance of his mercies in the future. He is not yet free from troubles. There are still enemies who afflict and threaten him - "heathen" who seek to "prevail" against him (vers. 19, 20), and perhaps already domestic enemies, especially the "sons of Zeruiah," causing him anxiety. <span class="cmt_word">Consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my trouble</span> (or, <span class="accented">my affliction</span>) <span class="accented">from my haters.</span> Vers. 17, 19, 20 show that the heathen are especially intended (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15-19</a>). Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Thou that continually (or, habitually) art my Support in the extremity of peril," "lifting me up" even from the very "gates of death." (For other mentions of "the gates of death," see <a href="../../par/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a>.) Classical writers speak of "the gates of darkness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in almost the same sense (Eurip., 'Hec.,' 1. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion</span>. The "daughter of Zion" is, of course, Jerusalem. Compare "daughter of Babylon" (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-42.htm">Jeremiah 50:42</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>), "daughter of the Chaldeans" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>), "daughter of Edom" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>), "daughter of Gallim" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>). Hengstenberg is probably right in understanding "in the gates" as "<span class="accented">within</span> the gates," since, as he observes, "God's praise is not to be celebrated <span class="accented">in</span> the gates, amid the throng of worldly business, but in the temple." The references in the ' Speaker's Commentary' do not bear out the statement there made, that "public mournings and public thanksgivings were proclaimed  in the gates." <span class="cmt_word">I will rejoice in thy salvation</span>; or, <span class="accented">that I may rejoice</span> (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i>that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made</span>. It is uncertain whether the writer here reverts to the judgment already executed (vers. 3-6), or with the eye of faith sees as past the judgment which he confidently anticipates (vers. 19, 20). Whichever he intends, there can be no doubt that he means it to be understood that the stratagems of the enemy brought about (or would bring about) their downfall. In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. A second metaphor, expressing the same idea as the preceding (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD is known <i>by</i> the judgment <i>which</i> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.

Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord hath made himself known</span>; <span class="accented">he executeth judgment</span> (see the Revised Version; and comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>). The two clauses are grammatically distinct, though no doubt closely connected in their meaning. God makes himself known - manifests his character, by the judgments which he executes, shows himself just, perhaps severe, certainly One who "will not at all acquit the wicked" (<a href="../../par/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands</span>. Some translate, "he snareth the wicked," or, "by snaring the wicked" - the special way in which God manifests himself (see Kay, p. 31; 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 190). Higgaion. This word is found in three other places only, viz. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; and <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. In the first it is translated "meditation," and has clearly that meaning; in the second it is supposed to mean "a gentle strain:" in the third it seems best rendered by "musing" or "reflection." Here it stands by itself, as a sort of rubrical direction, like the following word, "Selah." Some suppose it a direction to the choir to play a gentle strain of instrumental music as an interlude; others regard it as enjoining upon the congregation a space of quiet "meditation" (see Hengstenberg, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and compare Professor Alexander's work, 'The Psalms translated and explained,' p. 45). <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span> (see the comment on Psalm 3:2).
