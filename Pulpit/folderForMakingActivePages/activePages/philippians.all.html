St. Paul does not assume his official title in writing to the Macedonian Churches, Philippi and Thessalonica; it is used in all his other Epistles, except the short letter to Philemon. His relations to the Philippians and Thessalonians were those of the deepest personal affection; there was no need of a formal introduction, especially in an Epistle which has so little of an official character as this to the Philippians. He joins the name of Timothy with his own, as in 2 Corinthians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Thus Timothy is associated with St. Paul in every Epistle in which another name is found except 1 Corinthians, where Sosthenes only is mentioned; this shows the intimate affection that bound St. Paul to his "own son in the faith." There was a special reason for mentioning Timothy in this Epistle, as he was so well known to the Philippians, and St. Paul was intending (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>) to send him shortly to Philippi. But St. Paul writes in his own name from the beginning. Timothy was not in any sense a joint author; he may possibly have been St. Paul's amanuensis, as Tertius was in the case of the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="../../par/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>). Possibly also motives of humility led St. Paul to insert other names besides his own; but it was not to support his teaching by additional authority - he was "an apostle, not of man, neither by man," and needed not the weight of other names. <span class="cmt_word">The servants of Jesus Christ</span>; <span class="accented">slaves</span>, literally: "made free from sin and become servants [slaves] to God," whose service is perfect freedom. We belong to him: he he is our Master (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as Father, we are his slaves as well as his sons: "Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price." Compare the words of the "damsel possessed with a spirit of divination" at Philippi: "These men are the servants [slaves] of the most high God." She felt the difference between her state and theirs; she was the slave of her Philip-plan masters, of the evil spirit too; St. Paul and his companion were the slaves of God most high. In the best manuscripts, as in the R.V., "Christ" is put before "Jesus" here. The apostle frequently sets the official before the personal name of our Lord; possibly because he knew not the Lord Jesus after the flesh, but saw him first as the Messiah, the Christ of God. <span class="cmt_word">To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi</span>. The word "all" is of very frequent occurrence in this Epistle. There may possibly be a reference to the dissensions alluded to in ch. 4:2; or, as some think, to the supplies sent for St. Paul's assistance; he addresses all alike, not only those who contributed; he does not recognize their divisions. But it is, perhaps, only the natural expression of his warm affection: the apostle was beloved by all the Philippians, and all were dear to him; there was no hostile faction there, as at Corinth and else where. Compare the affectionate repetition, "always," "every," "all," in Ver. 4. St. Paul uses the word "saint" as the general name for his converts, like "Christian." The word "Christian" occurs only three times in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). Christ's people are called "brethren," "disciples," or "saints." Thus St. Paul addresses the Corinthians generally as "saints," though many of them were far from possessing holiness of heart and life. The ancient Church was holy; the Israelites are called "a holy nation," "saints of the Most High." They were holy by God's election, his chosen  people, separated unto him by the rite of circumcision. By the same election the Christian Church is holy, dedicated to God in baptism. This holiness of dedication (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) does not necessarily involve the actual existence of that inner holiness of heart "without which no man shall see the Lord." But it does imply the bounden duty of striving after that spiritual holiness. "Ye are the temple of the living God," St. Paul says to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). "for God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people...  <span class="accented">therefore</span>...   let us cleanse ourselves from el! filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in our translation sometimes "holy," sometimes "saint") is the usual rendering for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The primary idea of the Hebrew word seems to be that of separation - separation from all that defileth. God is "of purer eyes than to behold evil;" those who are dedicated to him must strive by his grace to purify themselves even as he is pure. "Be ye holy, for I am holy." <span class="accented">In Christ Jesus.</span> They are saints in virtue of their relation to Christ. They were once" baptized into one body" - the mystical body of Christ. Holiness of dedication can issue in holiness of heart and life only by abiding <span class="accented">in him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). All saints are one body in Christ; they are knit together into one communion and fellowship by their personal union with the one Lord. <span class="cmt_word">With the bishops and deacons</span>. In the New Testament the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-7</a>). St. Paul is addressing the elders of the Church at Philippi, not bishops in our sense of the word. It is possible that Epaphroditus may have been the presiding bishop of the Church (see notes on Philippians 2:25 and Philippians 4:3). If so, we see a reason why the second and third orders of the ministry only are mentioned, as Epaphroditus was the bearer of the Epistle. But diocesan episcopacy does not seem to have become general till the last quarter of the first century. We know that Paul and Barnabas "ordained elders in every Church" in their first missionary journey; we need not, therefore, be surprised at the mention of these official designations in this Epistle, which was written seventeen or eighteen years later. St. Paul's address to the elders of the Church at Ephesus shows the importance which he attached to the office and to the faithful performance of its duties. Perhaps "the bishops and deacons" are specially mentioned here as having collected. the contributions sent to St. Paul; so Chrysostom and Meyer. On the whole subject, see Bishop Lightfoot's exhaustive 'Dissertation on the Christian Ministry,' in his volume on the Epistle to the Philippians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-2.htm">Philippians 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace be unto you, and peace</span>. This combination of the Greek and Hebrew salutations is the common form in St. Paul's earlier Epistles; in the pastoral Epistles "mercy" is added. Grace is the favor of God, free and sovereign, which rests on the faithful Christian, and brings the gift of peace; which is, first, reconciliation with God and, secondly, the childlike confidence and trustful hope which result from faith in Christ's atonement. <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. God the Father is the first Author of our salvation; God the Son, the Word made flesh, brought the message of peace from heaven, and reconciled us to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you</span>. All St. Paul's Epistles, except those to the Galatiaus, 1 Timothy, and Titus, begin with a thanksgiving. In this Epistle the thanksgiving is especially warm and earnest; no cloud of doubt darkened the apostle's confidence in the Philippians; he pours forth his gratitude to God for their spiritual gifts fervently and without reserve. <span class="accented">My God.</span> The pronoun expresses the inner consciousness of personal relations with God; it reminds us of <a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>, "God, whose I am, and whom I serve." <span class="accented">Upon all my remembrance of you</span> (as R.V.) is the more exact rendering. The remembrance (not mention)was continuous; he "had them in his heart," and that unbroken remembrance resulted in unbroken thanksgiving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy</span>. Perhaps the first part of this verse is better joined with Ver. 3, "I <span class="accented">thank my God</span>...  <span class="accented">always in every prayer of mine for you all</span>;" so Bishop Lightfoot The Greek word for "prayer" and "request "is the same, better rendered "my supplication," he as the R.V.; it implies not merely a lifting up of the heart to God, but an earnest entreaty for a <span class="accented">necessary</span> gift. We meet now for the first time with that "joy" which is the keynote of this Epistle. "Summa epistolae, Gaudeo; gaudete;" so Bengel, who continues, "This Epistle of joy well follows that to the Ephesians, where love reigns. 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy.' Joy gives life to prayer." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel.</span> This verse should be taken in connection with Ver. 3. St. Paul thanks God for their help, their co-operation towards the work of the gospel. They helped forward the work by their prayers, their labors,  and their liberal bounty. This fellowship began "in the beginning of the gospel," when the Philippians sent aid to the apostle at Thessalonica and Corinth; it continued "until now" ten years; they had just sent their alms to St. Paul at Rome by phroditus (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being confident of this very thing</span>. St. Paul's thanksgiving refers, not only to the past, but also to the future. He has a confident trustfulness in God's power and love. The words <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> might mean "on this account," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on account of the perseverance described in Ver. 5, but the order seems to support the ordinary rendering. <span class="cmt_word">That he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it;</span> rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">which began.</span> Both <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> have (Bishop Lightfoot) a sacrificial reference. The good work is self-consecration, the sacrifice of themselves, their souls and bodies, issuing in the co-operation of labor and almsgiving. This sacrificial metaphor recurs in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>. The good work is God's; he began it and he will perfect it. The beginning (Bengel) is the pledge of the consummation. Yet it is also their work - their co-operation towards the gospel (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until the day of Jesus Christ</span>. The perfecting will go on until the great day. To the individual Christian that clay is practically the day of his death; though, indeed, the process of perfecting may be going on in the holy dead till they obtain their perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul. These words do not imply that St. Paul expected the second advent during the life of his Philippian converts. The words "in you" must be understood as meaning "in your hearts," not merely "among you." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all</span>. It is <span class="accented">meet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">just</span>, <span class="accented">right. To think this</span>; to entertain this confidence concerning you. <span class="cmt_word">Because I have you in my heart</span>; or, <span class="accented">because you have me in your heart.</span> But the order of the words, and ver. 8, make the first rendering the more probable. His love for them increases his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel</span>. These words may be taken with the preceding, "I have you in my heart during my imprisonment and defense." So Chrysostom, whose words are very striking: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. But it is, perhaps, more natural to take them with the following. <span class="cmt_word">Ye all are partakers of my grace</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye all are partakers with me of the grace.</span> They were partakers of the grace of God given to him in his bonds and in his work. The like grace was given to them both for the passive and active sides of the Christian life - both in endurance of suffering and in propagating the gospel. Thus there seems to be no reference in the words "defense and confirmation" to his public defense before Caesar (which probably had not yet taken place), but generally to his work of preaching the gospel, which was both apologetic, meeting the objections of adversaries, and aggressive, asserting the truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my record</span> - rather, <span class="accented">witness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, here rendered "bowels," means the heart, liver, etc.. he not the entrails. The expression is remarkable, and is well illustrated by Bengel's striking words, "Paulus non in Pauli, sed Jesu Christi movetur visceribus." "Not I, but Christ liveth in me." He is so united with Christ that he feels with the heart of Christ, he loves with the love of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <i>in</i> all judgment;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this I pray</span>. This is the purport of the prayer already mentioned in Ver. 4. The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> marks the end of St. Paul's prayer, and so its purport. <span class="cmt_word">That your love may abound yet more and more</span>. Your love; not love for the apostle only, but the grace of Christian charity. St. Paul finds no fault with the Philippians, but "ignis in apostolo nunquam dicit, Sufficit" (Bengel). He prays for their continued growth in love, but not unintelligent love. <span class="cmt_word">In knowledge and in all judgment</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: it means full, complete knowledge. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (literally, <span class="accented">sense</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament, though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (organs of sense) is found in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "Discernment," the rendering of R.V., is more correct than "judgment." It is, Bishop Wordsworth says, "that delicate tact and instinct, which almost intuitively perceives what is right, and almost unconsciously shrinks from what is wrong." It cannot exist without love. "Every one that loveth is born of God, and <span class="accented">knoweth</span> God." With love there comes a spiritual sense, spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, a sense of the beauty of holiness, a fine perception of Christian propriety; <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>.

Love, issuing in spiritual discernment, would enable them to recognize, to test, to prove things that are excellent; so Bengel," Non modo prae malts bona, seal in bonds optima." This seems better than the alternative rendering, "<span class="accented">to</span> prove the things that differ" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> according to the common derivation (from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, sunlight, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>), means "judged in the full light of the sun," that is, pure, true; comp. <a href="../../par/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>, "He that doeth truth cometh  to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." According to another possible derivation, the word would mean "unmixed," that is, genuine, sincere. "Without offense" may be taken actively or passively; without giving offense (causing stumbling) to others, or without stumbling themselves. Perhaps the latter sense is more suitable here. He prays that the Philippians may be true and pure inwardly, and blameless in their outward lives. "Till," rather, "against the day of Christ." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> does not denote time only, as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in Ver. 6; it implies preparation.

The best manuscripts read "fruit." He prays that their love may abound, not only in knowledge and discernment, but also in the fruit of holy living. The fruit of righteousness is sanctification, which springs from justification, and manifests itself in holy living (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are by Jesus Christ</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through.</span> The righteousness of God's saints is not that" which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>).

It is his life, living in, assimilated by the Christian soul, which brings forth the fruit of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the glory and praise of God.</span> The righteousness of God's saints, springing from the abiding presence of Christ, shows forth the glory of God. The glory of God is his majesty in itself; praise is the acknowledgment of this majesty by the voice and heart of man. The glory of God is the end of all Christian effort.

After thanksgiving and prayer, St. Paul turns to his own imprisonment at Rome. That imprisonment, he says, has resulted in the furtherance of the gospel, rather than, as might have been expected, in its hindrance.

But at Rome the name so used would give unnecessary offense, and there is no proof that it was ever used for the palatium there. St. Paul must have heard it constantly as the name of the Praetorian regiment; he was kept chained to a soldier of that corps (<a href="../../par/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16</a>); and as his guard was continually relieved, his name and sufferings for Christ would become gradually known throughout the force. Others, on the authority of a passage in Dion Cassius, understand the word of the barracks of that part of the Praetorian guard attached to the imperial residence on the Palatine. But the passage relates to the time of Augustus, before the Praetorian cohorts were established by Tiberius in the camp outside of the Colline Gate. <span class="cmt_word">And in all other places</span>; rather, as R.V. <span class="accented">and to all the rest</span>; generally, that is, throughout the city.

As the prayer ascends, says Bengel, the supply of the Spirit descends; comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>, "He that ministereth ['supplieth,' R.V.] to you the Spirit." The Spirit is the supply; the Lord Jesus sends the quickening Spirit from the Father. Others, as Meyer, make the genitive subjective, and interpret "the aid which the Spirit supplies." The Spirit is here called "the Spirit of Jesus Christ" - "proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">and the Son."</span> So also <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a> (in the true reading), "the Spirit of Jesus."

The Greek word for "earnest expectation," which occurs also in <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, means literally, a watching with outstretched head, with the attention concentrated on one object, and turned away from all others. Neither his sufferings nor the opposition of the Judaizers will put him to shame. <span class="cmt_word">But that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="accented">After</span> " <span class="accented">boldness"</span> (<span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">boldness of speech</span>) we should expect the active form, "I shall magnify." St. Paul, in his humility, prefers the pasture, "Christ shall be magnified." Boldness of speech was to be his part, the glory should be Christ's. Whatever the issue might be, whether a life of Christian labor or a martyr's death, it would be well. The apostles were not omniscient, says Bengel, in relation to their own future lot; they lived in faith and hope.

Others, as Calvin, render (not so well), "For to me Christ is gain both in life and in death." The alternative suggested in Ver. 20 leads St. Paul to a short digression on the comparative advantages of life and death; he is content with either. Life is blessed, for it is Christ; comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>, "Christ, who is our Life," and Galatians it. 20, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me;" "Quit-quid rive, Christum vivo" (Bengel). The life of Christ lives, breathes, energizes, in the life of his saints. His flesh, his incarnate life is their meat; his blood, the mystery of his atonement, is the drink of their souls. He abideth in them, and they in him. And yet death is gain; the slate of death, not the act of dying, is meant (the infinitive is aorist, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), for the dead in Christ are at home with the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in a far more blessed sense than the saints on earth.

St. Paul wavers between his own personal longing for rest in Paradise with Christ, and the thought that the continuance of his life on earth might conduce to the spreading of the gospel. The grammar of the Greek sentence aptly represents the apostle's hesitation. The  construction is almost hopelessly confused. Perhaps the interpretation of the R.V. is the simplest: "But if to live in the flesh, - if this is the fruit of my work, then what shall choose I wot not." Thus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is parallel with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Ver. 21); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;</span> is also a gain, a fruit; the genitive is one of apposition; the work itself is the fruit. St. Paul, says Bengel, regards his work as fruit, others seek fruit from their work. Bishop Lightfoot proposes another rendering, "But what if my living in the flesh will bear fruit, etc.? In fact what to choose I know not." Surely, says Bengel, the Christian's lot is excellent; he can hesitate only in the choice of blessings; disappointed he cannot be.

Being persuaded of this, that my life is needful for you; or, as others render, "And this I certainly, confidently know." The first translation seems preferable, for St. Paul's assurance does not seem to rest on direct inspiration, but on a calculation of probabilities.

The life of Christ ("I am meek and lowly in heart") and the teaching of Christ ("Blessed are the poor in spirit") have raised lowliness to a new position, as one of the chief features in the true Christian character. Here St. Paul bids us, as a discipline of humility, to look at our own faults and at the good points in the character of others (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).

The words, "in Christ Jesus," show that the corresponding words, "in you," cannot mean "among you," but in yourselves, in your heart. The apostle refers us to the supreme example of unselfishness and humility, the Lord Jesus Christ. He bids us mind (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>) the things which the Lord Jesus minded, to love what he loved, to hate what he hated; the thoughts, desires, motives, of the Christian should be the thoughts, desires, motives, which filled the sacred heart of Jesus Christ our Lord. We must strive to imitate him, to reproduce his image, not only in the outward, but even in the inner life. Especially here we are biddcn to follow his unselfishness and humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being in the form of God</span>. The word rendered "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) means, as R.V. in margin, being originally. It looks back to the time before the Incarnation, when the Word, the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, was with God (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>). What does the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> form, mean here? It occurs twice in this passage - Ver. 6, "form of God;" and Ver. 7, "form of a servant;" it is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> fashion, in Ver. 8. In the Aristotelian philosophy (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' De Anima,' 2:1, 2) <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>. is used almost in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as that which makes a thing to be what it is, the sum of its essential attributes: it is the form, as the expression of those essential attributes, the permanent, constant form; not the fleeting, outward <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, or fashion. St. Paul seems to make a somewhat similar distinction between the two words. Thus in <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> (or its derivatives) is used of the deep inner change of heart, the change which is described in Holy Scripture as a new creation; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used of the changeful fashion of the world and agreement with it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Then, when St. Paul tells us that Christ Jesus, being first in the form of God, took the form of a servant, the meaning must be that he possessed originally the essential attributes of Deity, and assumed in addition the essential attributes of humanity. He was perfect God; he became perfect (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). For a fuller discussion of the meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note ('Philippians,' p. 127), and Archbishop Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 70. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God; R.V. "counted it not a prize [margin, 'a thing to be grasped'] to be on an equality with God." These two renderings represent two conflicting interpretations of this difficult passage. Do the words mean that Christ asserted his essential Godhead ("thought it not robbery to be equal with God," as A.V.), or that he did not cling to the glory of the Divine majesty ("counted it not a prize," as R.V.)? Both statements are true in fact. The grammatical form of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which properly implies  an action or process, favors the first view, which seems to be adopted by most of the ancient versions and by most of the Latin Fathers. On the other hand, the form of the word does not exclude the passive interpretation; many words of the same termination have a passive meaning, and <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> itself is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, and a writer in the 'Catena Possini' on <a href="../../par/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a> (the three passages are quoted by Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loco</span>). The Greek Fathers (as Chrysostom <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.) generally adopt this interpretation. And the context seems to require it. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to an act, the act of abnegation; not to a state, the continued assertion. The conjunction "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) implies that the two sentences are opposed to one another. He did not grasp, but, on the contrary, he emptied himself. The first interpretation involves the tacit insertion of "nevertheless;" he asserted his equality, but nevertheless, etc. And the whole stress is laid on the Lord's humility and unselfishness. It is true that this second interpretation does not so distinctly assert the divinity of our Lord, already sufficiently asserted in the first clause, "being in the form of God." But it implies it. Not to grasp at equality with God would not be an instance of humility, but merely the absence of mad impiety, in one who was not himself Divine. On the whole, then, we prefer the second interpretation. Though he was born the beginning in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as a thing to be grasped, a prize to be tenaciously retained. Not so good is the view of Meyer and others: "Jesus Christ, when he found himself in the heavenly mode of existence of Divine glory, did not permit himself the thought of using his equality with God for the purpose of seizing possessions and honor for himself on earth." The R.V. rendering of the last words of the clause," to be on an equality," is nearer to the Greek and better than the A.V., "to be equal with God." Christ was equal with God (<a href="../../par/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). He did not cling to the outward manifestation of that equality. The adverbial form <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> implies the state or mode of equality rather than the equality itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But made himself of no reputation</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">but emptied himself</span>; not, he indeed, of the Godhead, which could not be, but of its manifestation, its glory. This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word "emptied' involves a previous fullness, "a precedent plenitude" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25). The Divine majesty of which he emptied himself was his own, his own rightful prerogative; and his humiliation was his own voluntary <span class="accented">act - he</span> emptied <span class="accented">himself.</span> "He used his equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement" (Alford). "<span class="accented">Manebat plenus</span>, <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, et tureen perinde se gessit ac si esset" (Bengel). And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in the form of God; he took (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> and Isaiah 52; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44, 45</a><span class="cmt_word">).

Form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; "We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body." <span class="accented">The likeness of men</span>; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature. He is one person in two natures. As Bishop Lightfoot says, "Christ, as the second Adam, represents, not the individual man, but the human race." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And being found in fashion as a man</span>. He humbled himself in the Incarnation; but this was not all. The apostle has hitherto spoken of our Lord's Godhead which he had from the beginning, and of his assumption of our human nature. He now speaks of him as he appeared in the sight of men. The aorist participle, "being found (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," refers to the time of his earthly life when he appeared as a man among men. Fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), as opposed to form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), implies the outward and transitory. In outward appearance he was as a man; he was more, for he was God. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death; translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">obedient.</span> The participle implies that the supreme act of self-humiliation consisted in the Lord's voluntary submission to death. the obedience of his perfect life extended even unto death. "He taketh away [literally,  'beareth,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] the sin of the world;" "The wages of sin is death;" therefore he suffered death for the sin which, himself sinless, he vouchsafed to bear. Here we may remark in passing that this connection of death with sin must have made death all the more awful to our sinless Lord. Even the death of the cross. No ordinary death, but of all forms of death the most torturing, the most full of shame - a death reserved by the Romans for slaves, a death accursed in the eyes of the Jews (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>).

He voluntarily assumed a subordinate position; God the Father exalted him. We must read, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the</span> Name. This seems to mean, not the name Jesus, which was given him at his circumcision, in accordance with the angel's message; but the name Lord or Jehovah (comp. Ver. 11), which was indeed his before his incarnation, but was given (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth") to Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son, God and Man in one Person. Or more probably, perhaps, the word "Name" is used here, as so often in the Hebrew Scriptures, for the majesty, glory, dignity, of the Godhead. Compare the oft-repeated words of the psahnist, "Praise the <span class="accented">Name</span> of the Lord." So Gesenius, in his Hebrew lexicon on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> he explains the Name of the Lord as (b) Jehovah as being called on and praised by men; and (c) the Deity as being present with mortals (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>).

The words may mean, either that all prayer must be offered to God in the name of Jesus, through his mediation; or that all creation must offer prayer to him. Both alternatives are true, and perhaps both are covered by the words; but the second seems to be principally intended (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>, "I will lift up my hands in thy Name."

Observe, the words are, not "the name Jesus," but "the name of Jesus;" the name, that is, which God freely gave to him (Ver. 9), It is the name which is above every name, that is, the majesty, the glory of Jesus, which is to be the object of Christian worship. The end of the whole passage being the exaltation of Jesus, it seems more natural to understand this verse of worship paid to Jesus than of worship offered through him to God the Father. Observe also that the words (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>) on which this passage is formed are the words of Jehovah: "Unto <span class="accented">me</span> every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."

The grace of God is alleged as a motive for earnest Christian work. The doctrines of grace and free-will are not contradictory: they may seem so to our limited understanding; but in truth they complete and snpplement one another. St. Paul does not attempt to solve the problem in theory; he bids us solve it in the life of faith (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. he "So run that ye may obtain;" and <a href="../../par/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy"). <span class="cmt_word">Of his good pleasure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>).

St. Paul regards his blood shed in martyrdom as a libation poured forth in willing sacrifice.

Compare also the similar words of Ignatius, 'Rom.' 2, and the words of the dying Seneca (Tacitus, 'Annals,' 15:64). Some think that the apostle, writing, as he does, to converted heathen, draws his metaphor from heathen sacrifices: in those sacrifices the libation was a much more important element than the drink offering in the Mosaic rites; and it was poured <span class="accented">upon</span> the sacrifice, whereas the drink offering seems to have been poured around the altar, not upon it. On the other hand, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is constantly used of the Jewish drink offering, and does not necessarily mean upon, but only "in addition to," or "at;" the drink offering being an accompaniment to the sacrifice. <span class="accented">Service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>).

In ecclesiastical Greek it stands for the order of the Holy Communion, the ancient liturgies; it is sometimes used loosely for any set form of public prayer. The analogy of <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, Where St. Paul exhorts Christians to present their bodies a living sacrifice, suggests that here the Philippians are regarded as priests (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>), offering the sacrifice of their faith, their hearts, themselves, in the ministrations of the spiritual priesthood; St. Paul's blood being represented as the accompanying drink offering. Others, comparing <a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>, where also sacrificial words are used, regard St. Paul himself as the ministering priest, and understand the metaphor of a priest slain at the altar, his blood being shed while he is offering the sacrifice of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">I joy, and rejoice with you all</span>.

It was a great sacrifice in one who so yearned for Christian sympathy to submit to the absence of the one true loving friend. St. Paul's spiritual isolation increases our wonder and admiration for the strain of holy joy which runs through this Epistle.

The apostle was subject, like all of us, to changing currents of thought, to the ebb and flow of spirits; but his trust was always in the Lord. "Behold," says Chrysostom, "how he makes all things depend upon God." His hope, in all probability, was fulfilled (see <a href="../../par/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>).

Epaphroditus is mentioned only in this Epistle. Epaphras is the contracted form, but the name is a common one, and there is no evidence of his identity with the Epaphras of Colossians and Philemon. He seems to have been the bearer of this Epistle. St. Paul felt that to come himself, or even to  send Timothy, might possibly not be in his power; he thought it necessary, a matter of duty, to send Epaphroditus at once<span class="cmt_word">. My brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier</span>. Mark how the epithets rise one above another; they imply fellowship in religion, in work, in endurance. <span class="cmt_word">But your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants</span>. "Your" refers to both clauses; "your messenger, and (your) minister to my need." Epaphroditus had brought to St. Paul the contributions of the Philippians (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Some think that the word rendered "messenger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally "apostle") means that Epaphroditus was the apostle, that is, the bishop of the Philippian Church. It may be so (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and note); but there is no proof of the establishment of any diocesan bishops, except St. James at Jerusalem, at so early a period. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. both here and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is probably used in its first meaning in the sense of messenger, or delegate. The Greek word for minister, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, seems to imply, like <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in Ver. 30, that St. Paul regarded the alms of the Philippians as an offering to God, ministered by Epaphroditus. (But see <a href="../../par/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>, also <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-43.htm">2 Kings 4:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a>, etc. in the Greek.)

The verb is strengthened by the preposition: "was eagerly longing." Perhaps it should be rendered. he "is longing;" like "I count it necessary," in Ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">And was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</span> "Full of heaviness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is the word used of our blessed Lord in his agony (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>). Some derive it from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, he away from home; others, more probably, from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of loathing, weariness, satiety. The word implies heart-sickness, restless; unsatisfied weariness, produced by some overwhelming distress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-27.htm">Philippians 2:27</a></div><div class="verse">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow</span>. St. Paul recognizes the thankfulness of Epaphroditus for the recovery of his health: he shares that thankfulness himself. Mark his human sympathies; he had a "desire to depart," but he rejoices in the recovery of his friend. St. Paul does not seem to have healed Epaphroditus. The power of working miracles, like that of foreseeing the future (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>, and note), was not, it seems, continuous; both were exercised only in accordance with the revealed will of God and on occasions of especial moment.

Note St. Paul's ready sympathy with the Philippians: their restored joy will involve a diminution of his sorrow. Mark also the implied admission that sorrows must still remain, though spiritual joy brightens and relieves them. "Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a></div><div class="verse">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death</span>. The readings vary between "Christ" and "the Lord." One ancient manuscript reads simply, "for the work's sake." The work in this case consisted in ministering to the wants of St. Paul. Translate the following words, with R.V., <span class="accented">he came nigh unto death.</span> Not regarding his life; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">hazarding his life</span>, which translation represents the best-supported reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the verb literally means "to lay down a stake, to gamble." Hence the word <span class="accented">Parabolani</span>, the name given to certain brotherhoods in the ancient Church who undertook the hazardous work of tending the sick and burying the dead in times of pestilence. The A.V. represents the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> consulting amiss. <span class="cmt_word">To supply your lack of service toward me;</span> rather, as <span class="accented">R.V., that which was lacking in your service.</span> The Philippians are not blamed. Epaphroditus did that which their absence prevented them from doing. His illness was caused by over-exertion in attending to the apostle's wants, or, it may be, by the hardships of the journey. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken closely with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the lack of your presence. St. Paul, with exquisite delicacy, represents the absence of the Philippians as something lacking to his complete satisfaction, something which he missed, and which Epaphroditus supplied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../philippians/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Philippians 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Philippians 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../philippians/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Philippians 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Philippians 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/philippians/3.htm"><title>Philippians 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/philippians/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/philippians/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/philippians/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../philippians/2.htm" title="Philippians 2">&#9668;</a> Philippians 3 <a href="../philippians/4.htm" title="Philippians 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.

This word "finally" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is frequently used by St. Paul to introduce a practical conclusion after the doctrinal portion of his Epistles: thus it occurs again in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, and also in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>. Some render <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "farewell;" but "rejoice" seems more suitable here. The golden thread of spiritual joy runs through this Epistle. "Rejoice in the Lord" is the oft-repeated refrain of St. Paul's solemn hymn of praise. <span class="cmt_word">To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe</span>. "The same things:" does he refer to his oral instructions, to a previous Epistle now lost, to his exhortations to unity, or to his reiterated command "Rejoice"? The words seem most naturally to point to something in the same Epistle rather than to advice given on former occasions. It is true that Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippiaus (section 3), says that St. Paul wrote Epistles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>) to them; but there is no trace of any other Epistle; and the mere plural number is not sufficient to support the theory of other letters, the plural word being frequently used of a single letter. Bishop Lightfoot suggests the exhortation to unity in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>. But this topic does not reappear before <a href="../../par/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>. And the hypothesis of an interruption, which (as Bishop Lightfoot and others think) suddenly turned the apostle's thoughts into another channel and prevented him from explaining <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> (the same things) till <a href="../../par/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>, seems forced and unnecessary, notwithstanding the great authority by which it is supported. It seems more probable (Bengel and others) that St. Paul refers to the constant admonition of this Epistle, "Rejoice in the Lord." To repeat this again and again was to him not grievous (rather, with R.V., "irksome"), but safe for the Philippians. Christian joy has a close connection with safety, for it implies unswerving faith, and, more than that, the presence of Christ. Compare the oft-repeated exhortation of <a href="../../par/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, "Fret not thyself: it tends only to evil-doing" (ver. 8, in the Hebrew). Possibly, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in <a href="../../par/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a> and. 25:26, may mean "certain." The repetition is not irksome to St. Paul, while it makes his meaning and his wishes certain to the Philippians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision</span>. The connection is, as given in ver. 3, Rejoice in the Lord, not in the flesh; have confidence in him, not in the ceremonies of the Jewish Law. Compare the same contrast in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-13.htm">Galatians 6:13, 14</a>. There is certainly something abrupt in the sudden introduction of this polemic against Judaizing, especially in writing to Philippi, where there were not many Jews. But there may have been circumstances, unknown to us, which made the warning necessary; or, as some think, the apostle may have written this under excitement caused by the violent opposition of the Jewish faction at Rome. <span class="accented">Beware</span>; literally, <span class="accented">mark</span>, observe them, to be on your guard against them. The <span class="accented">dogs.</span> The article must be retained in the translation. The Jews called the Gentiles "dogs" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unclean, mainly because of their disregard of the distinction between clean and unclean food. St. Paul retorts the epithet: they are the dogs, who have confidence in the flesh, not in spiritual religion. <span class="accented">Evil workers</span>; so <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, where he calls them "deceitful workers." The Judaizers were active enough, like the Pharisees who "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte;" but their activity sprang from bad motives - they were evil workers, though their work was sometimes overruled for good (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-18</a>). <span class="accented">The concision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, cutting, mutilation); a contemptuous word for "circumcision" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>). Compare the Jewish contemptuous use of Isbosheth, man of shame, for Eshbaal, man of Baal, etc. Their circumcision is no better than a mutilation. Observe the paronomasia, the combination of like-sounding words, which is common in St. Paul's Epistles. Winer gives many examples in sect. lxviii.

As far as "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees" went, the righteousness which is "in Law," which consists, that is, in the observance of formal rules; or which is "of Law" (ver. 9), which springs, that is, from such observance, St. Paul was found blameless.

The loss of one's all in this world (St. Paul echoes the sacred words) is as nothing; all things put together are but as dung, compared with the one thing which St. Paul so longed to gain, Christ himself - his presence in the soul, spiritual union with the Lord. "To gain Christ is to lay fast hold upon him, to receive him inwardly into our bosoms, and so to make him ours and ourselves his, that we may be joined to him as our Head, espoused to him as our Husband, incorporated into him as our Nourishment, engrafted in him as our Stock, and laid upon him as a sure Foundation" (Bishop Hall, ' Christ Mystical,' ch. 6, quoted by Bishop EIlicott).

But perhaps the words are best rendered, as in the margin of R.V., "Not having as my righteousness that which is of the Law." St. Paul was blameless as regards that righteousness which lies in legal observances: in that he puts no confidence, he seeks a better righteousness<span class="cmt_word">. But that which is through the faith of Christ;</span> rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">through faith in</span> Christ. There is no article, and the genitive is objective. Through faith. God is the Giver, the Source of righteousness; it is given through faith as the means, on condition of faith. <span class="cmt_word">The righteousness which is of God by faith</span>. Greek, "upon faith," based upon faith, or on condition of faith. St. Paul speaks of "having" this righteousness. Then it is his; yet it is not any righteousness of his own, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done;" but a righteousness of God given to him, merited, not by his works, but by the perfect obedience and the precious death of Christ, and granted unto all who are found in Christ. It comes from God, the one only Giver of all good things; it is obtained through faith as the instrument or means; and it is given on that faith - on condition, that is, of a living faith abiding in the soul. Thus St. Paul states incidentally, but simply and forcibly, the great doctrine of justification by faith.

For the knowledge here spoken of is a personal knowledge, gained, not by hearing or reading, but by direct personal communion with the Lord; it is not theoretical, but experimental. "non expertus fuerit, non intelligit" (Anselm, quoted by Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">And the power of his resurrection</span>. The resurrection of Christ was a glorious manifestation of Divine power (<a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>). That resurrection is now a power in the spiritual life of Christians: it stimulates the spiritual resurrection, the resurrection from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is the center of our most cherished hopes, the evidence of our immortality, the earnest of the resurrection of the body. <span class="cmt_word">And the fellowship of his sufferings</span>. This clause and the last are bound together under one article, according to the best manuscripts. There is a very close connection between them (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>). To know the quickening power of his resurrection, we must share his sufferings. The Christian, meditating in loving thought on the sufferings of Christ, is led to feel ever a deeper, a more awful sympathy with the suffering Savior. And if, when we are called to suffer, we take it patiently, looking unto Jesus, then our sufferings are united with his sufferings,  "we suffer <span class="accented">with</span> him." And he who hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows feels for us in his sacred heart, being "touched with the feeling of our infirmities." This fellowship in suffering leads through his grace to fellowship in glory (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Being made conformable unto his death</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">becoming conformed.</span> The participle is present: it implies a continual progress. It is derived from the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, form, used in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> (where see note), and denotes, not a mere external resemblance, but a deep, real, inner conformity. The reference is not to the impending death of martyrdom, but to that daffy dying unto self and the world which the apostle exhibited in the heroic self-denials of his holy life: he was "crucified with Christ" (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>).

The apostle uses the language of humble expectation. For the particles, "if by any means" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-14.htm">Romans 11:14</a>. The verb "attain" means to arrive at the end of a journey; it presents the figure of a pilgrimage. Read, with R.V. and the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the resurrection from the dead.</span> This phrase (used also in <a href="../../par/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>) means the resurrection of the <span class="accented">blessed</span> dead (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).

The tense is aorist: "I say not that I did at once win the prize;" that is, at the time of his conversion. Compare the tenses used in ver. 8, "I suffered the loss of all things;" and ver. 12, "I was apprehended;" which both refer to the same time. The prize was gained in a moment; it needs the continued effort of a lifetime. St. Paul proceeds, using now the perfect tense, "Nor have I been already made perfect." He has not even now reached perfection; he is still working out his own salvation. There may be here a delicate allusion to the spiritual pride which seems to have disturbed the unity of the Philippians (see <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But I follow after</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">pursue</span>, <span class="accented">I press</span> on. <span class="cmt_word">If that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus</span>.

All these translations are possible, and all give a good sense. Perhaps <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> best suits the context, "I press on to lay hold o[the prize, because Christ first laid hold of me." The grace of the Lord Jesus furnishes the highest motive; it is the Christian's bounden duty to press on always in the Christian race, <span class="accented">because</span> Christ first called him.

St. Paul concentrates all his thoughts and all his energies on the one great end of life, the one thing needful.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded</span>. "Perfect" here means mature, full grown, as opposed to babes or children. The word is so used (in the Greek) in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "There is a difference," says Bengel, on ver. 12, "between the perfect and the perfected: the first are ready for the. race; the last are close upon the prize." St. Paul exhorts all full-grown Christians to imitate his perseverance; like him, to forsake any claims to legal righteousness; to seek that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ; to know Christ, to win Christ; to press ever forwards to obtain the prize. <span class="cmt_word">And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you</span>.. If only we be in earnest, pressing onwards in the Christian race with sustained perseverance, God will, by the manifestation of his Spirit in our heart, correct any minor errors of doctrine or of practice. Comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, "If any man willeth to do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God." "Otherwise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) seems here to mean otherwise thin is right, wrongly, amiss - a meaning which it has not unfrequently in classical Greek, and in our word "heterodox." Even <span class="accented">this</span>; rather, <span class="accented">this too</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> well as the one thing needful, the knowledge of Christ, which he has already revealed. Mark the word "reveal." Paul may teach, but living spiritual knowledge is a revelation from God. This passage shows that the word "perfect" is used here in a restricted sense, not of consummated holiness; as it implies that some of the "perfect" may be "otherwise minded," may be involved in minor errors. Good Christians must have that righteousness which is through faith; they must persevere: they may err in less essential points. It is a lesson of charity and humility.

He changes the singular number to the plural, modestly shrinking from proposing himself alone as their example. But "ensample" is still singular, because they all (Timothy, Epaphroditus, etc.) present the same image, all imitating Christ. Observe the change of metaphor: hitherto the Christian life has been compared to a race; now he speaks of walking; literally, <span class="accented">walking about</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), moving hither and thither in the daily path of life.

"Paul weeps," says Chrysostom, "for those at whom others laugh; so true is his sympathy, so deep his care for all men." He seems to be speaking here, not of the Jews, but of nominal Christians, who used their liberty for a cloke of licentiousness. Such are enemies of the cross; they hate sell-denial, they will not take up their cross. By their evil lives they bring shame upon the religion of the cross.

The A.V. has this same word "conversation" in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) is the verb corresponding with the noun (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x39c;&#x3b1;</span>) which occurs here. The verb is used in the sense of a certain mode of life or conversation, as in <a href="../../par/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, but it does not appear that the noun ever bears that meaning.

There St. Paul tells us that he who was originally in the form of God took upon him the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man.

He had already told us (ver. 10) that the Christian soul is being gradually conformed during life unto the death of Christ. He now tells us that this conformity of the Christian unto Christ is ultimately to extend to the body.

He seems scarcely able to find words adequate to express his love for the Philippians; he heaps together epithets of affection, dwelling tenderly on the word "beloved." He tells them of his longing desire to see them, repeating the word used in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>. He calls them his "joy and crown" - his joy now, his crown hereafter. He uses the same words of the other great Macedonian Church in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, "What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye?" The Greek word for "crown" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) means commonly either the wreath ("the corruptible crown," <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>) which was the prize of victors at the Grecian games; or a garland worn at banquets and festivities. The royal crown is generally <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Septuagint for a king's crown (see (in the Greek) <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>; Psalm 20:4 (A.V., Psalms 21:3); <a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>). The crown of thorns, too, which was used in mockery of the Savior's kingly title, was <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, though this may possibly have been suggested by the laurel wreath worn by the Roman Caesars (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 23.). "The crown of life," "the crown of glory that fadeth not away," is the emblem both of victory and of gladness. Yet it is also in some sense kingly: the saints shall sit with Christ in his throne; they shall reign with him; they are kings ("a kingdom," R.V., with the best manuscripts) and priests unto God (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>). In this place victory seems to be the thought present to the apostle's mind. In <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a> and Philippians 2:12-14 he has been comparing the Christian life with the course of the Grecian athletes. Now he represents his converts as constituting his crown or wreath of victory at the last; their salvation is the crowning reward of his labors and sufferings<span class="cmt_word">. So stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved</span>. <span class="accented">So</span>; that is, as ye have us for an example; or perhaps, as becomes citizens of the heavenly commonwealth. The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) is used in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, also in connection with the idea of citizenship.

The narrative in <a href="../../par/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a> shows that the female element was more than usually important in the early Philippian Church. These ladies seem to have held a high position in that Church; possibly they may have been deaconesses, like Phoebe at Cenchrea. Their dissensions disturbed the peace of the Church. The repeated "I beseech" is emphatic; it may, perhaps, also imply that both were in fault. St. Paul earnestly begs them to be reconciled, and to be reconciled as Christians, in the Lord, as members of his body, in the consciousness of his presence. Mark how often the words, "in Christ," "in the Lord," occur in this Epistle; how constantly the thought of spiritual union with Christ was present to the apostle's mind.

Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 40.). Who was the "true yokefellow"? Some, following Clement of Alexandria, interpret the words of a supposed wife of St. Paul. But the Greek adjective has the masculine termination; and it is plain, from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>, that St. Paul was unmarried. Others take one of the Greek words as the proper name of the person addressed, Syzygus or Gnesius. On the first supposition, the play on the meaning of <span class="accented">S</span>y<span class="accented">zygus</span>, yokefellow, would resemble St. Paul's reference to Onesimus in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a>. But neither of these words seems to occur as a proper name. Some again, as Chrysostom, interpret the word of the husband of Euodia or Syntyche: this does not seem likely. Others think that Lydia may be addressed here. The omission of her name is remarkable; but she may bare been dead or no longer resident at Philippi. Others understand the chief pastor of the Church at Philippi, who may very possibly have been Epaphroditus himself, the bearer of the letter. This, on the whole, seems the most probable  conjecture. The omission of the name implies that the person addressed was in a conspicuous position, so that there was no danger of mistakes. An important duty is assigned to him. And it may be that the word "yokefellow," as distinguished from "fellow-laborer," denotes something more of equality with the apostle<span class="cmt_word">. Help those women which labored with me in the gospel</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">help those women</span>, <span class="accented">for they labored with me.</span> Help Euodia and Syntyche towards a mutual reconciliation, and that, inasmuch as they labored in the gospel<span class="cmt_word">. With Clement also</span>. Are these words to be connected with "help" or with labored"? Is Clement associated with the "true yokefellow" in the work of reconciliation, or with the women who labored with St. Paul? The balance of probability seems to be in favor of the first alternative; there appears to be no reason for mentioning Clement's labors in this place; while, on the other hand, St. Paul's anxiety for the reconciliation of Euodia and Syntyehe might naturally urge him to ask for the combined efforts of all his fellow-laborers. Whether this Clement is to be identified with St. Clement the Bishop of Rome is an open question; there are no sufficient data for deciding it (see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note). <span class="cmt_word">And with other my fellow-laborers</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">and the rest of my fellow-workers.</span> St. Paul appeals to them all. <span class="cmt_word">Whose names are in the book of life</span>.

In the Aristotelian' Ethics' it stands for the temper which contents itself with less than its due, and shrinks from insisting on its strict rights. There is no joy in a narrow selfishness; joy involves an open heart, a generous love. Joy in the Lord tends to make men gentle and mild to others. "Gaudium in Domino," says Bengel, "parit veram aequitatem erga proximum." <span class="accented">Unto all men</span>; heathen as well as Christian. Compare our Lord's word: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." St. Paul would have the heathen <span class="accented">say</span>, "See how these Christians love one another." Their mutual love would be the blessed means of drawing fresh converts to the faith. There may possibly be an allusion here to the differences between Euodia and Syntyche; let there be no more disagreements, but rather mutual forbearance. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is at hand</span>. The Aramaic <span class="accented">Maranatha</span> ("the Lord cometh") in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a> seems to imply that these words were current in the Church as a formula of warning, like "Hallelujah" as a set form of praise. The Lord is at hand therefore be not careful to exact your full rights; love is more precious than gold in the treasury of heaven. Comp. <a href="../../par/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a>, "Be ye also patient,...  for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." Others interpret the words, not of the future advent, but of the Lord's present nearness.

Comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>, where the apostle bids us cast all our care (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) upon God.

"He careth for us." <span class="cmt_word">But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God</span>. "Curare et orare," says Bengel, "plus inter se pugnant quam aqua et ignis." <span class="accented">In everything</span>; in each emergency, little or great, as it arises, pray; cultivate the habit of referring all things, great or small, to God in prayer.

St. Paul himself is an example of constant thanksgiving. All his Epistles, except those to the Galatians, 1 Timothy, and Titus, open with a thanksgiving. In the dungeon at Philippi he and Silas "prayed and sang praises unto God" (<a href="../../par/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>). Our requests, the things for which we ask, are to be made known unto God; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> before God, in the presence of God, by prayer, the general converse of the soul with God; and by supplication, direct petitions for the supply of our necessities. Indeed, he knows our necessities before we ask; but we are encouraged to make them known before him, as Hezekiah took the letter of Sennacherib and spread it before the Lord.

The peace which God gives, which flows from the sense of his most gracious presence, and consists in childlike confidence and trustful love. This peace passeth all understanding; its calm blessedness transcends the reach of human thought; it can be known only by the inner experience of the believer. The similar passage, Ephesians in 20, "Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think," seems decisive for the ordinary interpretation. Bishop Light-foot, Meyer, and others take another view of the passage: "Surpassing every device or counsel of man. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which is far better, which produces a higher satisfaction, than all punctilious self-assertion, all anxious forethought." <span class="cmt_word">Shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> Peace shall guard - "a verbal paradox, for to guard is a warrior's duty" (Bishop Lightfoot). The peace of God abiding in the heart is a sure and trusty garrison, guarding it so that the evil spirit, once cast out, cannot return.

He urges them to fill their thoughts with things good and holy. Christ is the Truth: all that is true comes from him; the false, the vain, is of the earth, earthy. Perhaps the verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>) may be emphatic. Sceptics may deny the existence of absolute truth; men may scoffingly ask, "What is truth?"

The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>) occurs only here and four times in the pastoral Epistles. It is a word difficult translate. "Honourable" or" reverend" (the renderings of the R.V.) are better equivalents than "honest." It points to a Christian decorum, a Christian self-respect, which is quite consistent with true humility, for it is a reverence for the temple of God. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are just</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">righteous</span>, in the widest meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are pure</span>; not only chaste, but free from stain or defilement of any sort. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not common in the New Testament.

The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) means "well-speaking" (not "well spoken of"), and so "gracious," "attractive;" in classical Greek it means "auspicious," "of good omen." Of these six heads, the first two describe the subjects of devout thought as they are in themselves; the second pair relate to practical life; the third pair to the moral approbation which the contemplation of a holy life excites in good men. <span class="cmt_word">If there be any virtue</span>. This word, so very common in the Greek moralists, occurs nowhere else in St. Paul. Nor does any other of the New Testament writers use it except St. Peter (l Peter 2:9 (in the Greek); <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, "The strangeness of the word, combined with the change of expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, will suggest another explanation: 'Whatever value may reside in your old heathen conception of virtue, whatever consideration is due to the praise of men; ' as if the apostle were anxious not to omit any possible ground of appeal." <span class="cmt_word">And if there be any praise</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, where St. Paul bids us "provide for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men." Nevertheless, in the highest point of view, the praise of the true Israelite is not of man, but of God. <span class="cmt_word">Think on these things</span>; or, as in the margin of R.V., <span class="accented">take account of.</span> Let these be the considerations which guide your thoughts and direct your  motives.

Offsets, as Meyer, render differently, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> flourished again (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in your circumstances) so as to mind my interests."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/4-20.htm">Philippians 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">Now unto God and our Father <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>; rather, with R.V., <span class="accented">unto our God and Father be the glory.</span> The thought of God's present mercies, and the hope of glory to come mentioned in the last verse, suggest the doxology. Observe, St. Paul <span class="accented">says</span>, "our God and Father" here. He said, "my God" in ver. 19, where he was speaking of the reward which God would give for kindness shown to himself; but now "our God," as the one Object of praise and worship from the universal Church. <span class="accented">The</span> glory; the article is commonly used with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in these doxologies - the glory which is God's peculiar possession, which is essentially his (comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, in his note on Galatians 1:5, "It is probable that we should supply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> in such cases rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>. It is an affirmation rather than a wish. Glory is the essential attribute of God. See <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the doxology added to the Lord's Prayer (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>)." <span class="accented">For ever and ever</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for the ages of ages</span>; for the ages which consist, not of years, but of ages, for the countless ages of eternity (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/4-21.htm">Philippians 4:21</a></div><div class="verse">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus</span>. Every saint individually - an expression of personal affection. The words,  "in Christ Jesus," may be taken with "salute," as in <a href="../../par/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a> and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>. It is a Christian salutation, an acknowledgment of spiritual relationship; or better, perhaps, as in numerous passages, with "saint." All saints are in Christ, members of his body, knit together into one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of Christ. It is this union with Christ which makes them saints. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren which are with me greet you.</span> Observe, he calls them "brethren," though he had none like-minded with him, save only Timothy (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20, 21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a></div><div class="verse">All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household</span>. All the Christians at Rome, not only St. Paul's personal friends and companions. It is not clear why he lays a special stress on those belonging to Nero's household. The reason given by Chrysostom seems somewhat fanciful: "If those who dwelt in palaces despised all things for the sake of the King of heaven, much more should the Philippians do so." Some of them may have been known to the Philippian Christians. The term <span class="accented">familia</span> or <span class="accented">domus Caesaris</span> included all ranks, from the highest official to the lowest freedman or slave. It is probable that those alluded to here belonged to the humbler classes. But at any rate St. Paul's words prove that his preaching had penetrated into that abyss of all infamy, the palace of Nero. (For the Christianity of Seneca, and the supposed correspondence between him and St. Paul see Bishop Lightfoot's dissertation on 'St. Paul and Seneca.' See also his detached note on 'Caesar's Household.')
