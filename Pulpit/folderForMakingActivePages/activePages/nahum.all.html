As an illustration of this statement (though, of course, the fact was utterly unknown to Nahum), it has been remarked that recent scientific discovery asserts that clouds owe their beauty, and even their very existence, to the presence of dust particles in the atmosphere. The aqueous vapour, it is said, condenses on these particles, and thus becomes visible.

The shields of the early Assyrians were usually circular or oval in shape, formed of wicker work, with a central boss of wood or metal. In the latest period they were made straight at bottom and rounded only at top (Rawlinson's 'Anc. Mon.,' 1:440). Some bronze shields have been brought to England from Nineveh; these are circular, about two feet and a half in diameter, the rim bending inwards, and forming a deep groove round the edge. The handles are of iron, and fastened by six bosses or nails, the heads of which form an ornament on the outer face of the shield (Layard, 'Discoveries,' p. 194). There were used also in sieges tall oblong shields, sufficient to protect the entire body, constructed of wicker work or the hides of animals (Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 320, etc.). The shields are said to be "made red," either because they were really so coloured (though the monuments have not confirmed this opinion), or else because of the polished copper with which they were sometimes covered (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:12. 5). Septuagint, pointing differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the arms of their power from among men." <span class="cmt_word">Are in scarlet.</span> The word rendered "scarlet" is found nowhere else.

It is derived from the term applied to the <span class="accented">coccus</span>, or worm which was used in dyeing to give to cloth a deep scarlet colour (Henderson). Some have seen in the colour of the soldiers' garments an emblem of the Divine wrath of which they were the appointed ministers. This colour was much affected by combatants in old times as in modern days. Professor Edwards quotes Aelian, 'Var. Hist.' 6:6, "it was necessary to enter into battle clothed in purple, that the colour might denote a certain dignity, and if drops of blood from wounds were sprinkled on it, it became terrible to the enemy" (comp. Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 1:3, 2). Red or purple seems to have been the favourite colour of the Medea and Babylonians (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>), blue or violet that of the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>, etc.) (Orelli). <span class="cmt_word">The chariots shall be with flaming torches;</span> literally, <span class="accented">are with fire of steels</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> flash with steel, and so the clause should be translated, as in the Revised Version. Commentators generally refer the description to the steel bosses of the wheels; but the Assyrian chariots (and those of the Medes and Chaldeans were not dissimilar) were conspicuous for shining metal, hung round with gleaming weapons and figures of the heavenly bodies, carrying bright armed warriors, the homes covered with trappings, which flashed under the sunshine, and fastened to poles of glittering steel. There is no trace in the monuments of chariots armed with scythes, which seem to have been unknown before the time of Cyrus. They are first mentioned in 2 Macc. 13:2 (see Livy, 37:41). The word <span class="accented">peladoth</span>, translated "torches," is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The LXX. renders it, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the reins," whence Jerome obtained his version, <span class="accented">igneae habenae curruum</span>; but it means, "things made of iron or steel,"and by critics uninstructed in monumental discoveries was naturally referred to the scythes with which chariots were armed in later times, instead of to the gleaming metal with which they were adorned. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of his preparation.</span> When the Lord marshals the host for battle, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The fir trees shall be terribly shaken,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spears with their fir or cypress shafts are brandished. So Homer often calls the spear "the ash," from the material of which the handle was made (comp. 'Il.,' 16:143; 22:225, etc.). The Septuagint rendering is very far from the present text, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "The horsemen shall be thrown into confusion." Nor is the Vulgate any better, <span class="accented">Agitatores cosopiti sunt</span>, which is explained to mean that the invaders are so carried away by their courage and fury, that they act as if intoxicated. "Sensus utique non spernedus," says a Roman Catholic commentator, "at unum desidero, ut scil. ex verbo ipso fluat" - which is certainly not the case. The text is possibly corrupt, and might be corrected from the Septuagint. Certainly there seems to be no other passage in the Hebrew Scriptures where the metaphor of "cypress" is used for "a spear." After the mention of the chariots, it is not unnatural that the writer should proceed, "and the riders are in active motion," urging their horses with hand and whip and gesture (see Knabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

They see the besiegers bringing up their mantelets and towers. As used by the Assyrians, the machine called "the covering" is either a wooden tower or a wicker mantelet in which was suspended a battering ram. It stood on four or six wheels, and the larger sort had archers posted in the various stories, both to annoy the enemy and to defend the engine. The rams were provided with lance headed extremities, and must have rather picked at and loosened the courses of bricks of which the walls were composed than battered them down (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 160, 234, 243, etc. Layard, 'Nineveh,' ch. 5. p. 376, etc., figs. 57, 58).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - All defence is vain. The prophet describes the last scene. <span class="cmt_word">The gates of the rivers shall be</span> (<span class="accented">are</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>opened</span>. The simplest explanation of this much disputed clause is, according to Strauss and others, the following: The gates intended are those adjacent to the streams which encircled the city, and which were therefore the best defended and the hardest to capture. When these were carried, there was no way of escape for the besieged. But, as Rosenmuller remarks, it would have been an act of folly in the enemy to attack just that part of the city which was most strongly defended by nature and art. We are, therefore, induced to take "the gates of the rivers," not literally, but as a metaphorical expression (like "the windows of heaven," <a href="../../par/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a> l; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>) for an overwhelming flood, and to see in this a reference to the fact mentioned by Diod. Sic. (2:27), that the capture of Nineveh was owing to a great and unprecedented inundation, which destroyed a large portion of the fortifications, and laid the city open to the enemy. "At the northwest angle of Nineveh," says Professor Rawlinson, "there was a sluice or flood gate, intended mainly to keep the water of the Khosr-su, which ordinarily filled the city moat, from flowing off too rapidly into the Tigris, but probably intended also to keep back the water of the Tigris, when that stream rose above its common level. A sudden and great rise in the Tigris would necessarily endanger this gate, and if it gave way beneath the pressure, a vast torrent of water would rush up the moat along and against the northern wall, which may have been undermined by its force, and have fallen in" (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2. p. 397, edit. 1871). The suggestion that the course of its rivers was diverted, and that the enemy entered the town through the dried channels, has no historical basis. Dr. Pusey explains the term to mean the gates by which the inhabitants had access to the rivers. But these would be well guarded, and the open. ing of them would not involve the capture of the city, which the expression in the text seems to imply. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "The gates of the cities were opened." <span class="cmt_word">The palace shall be</span> (is) <span class="cmt_word">dissolved;</span> or, <span class="accented">melteth away.</span> Some take this to signify that the hearts of the in. habitants melt with fear, or the royal power vanishes in terror. That the clause is to be taken literally, to denote the destruction of the royal palace by the action of the waters, seems to be negatived by the fact that the Assyrian palaces were built on artificial mounds of some thirty or forty feet in elevation, composed of sun-dried bricks united into a solid mass, and were thus secured from the effects of an inundation (see Bosoms, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 129, etc.). There is evidence, too, that fire played a great part in the destruction of the temples and palaces (see note on Nahum 3:13).

We may dismiss the idea that <span class="accented">Huzzab</span> is the name of the queen. Such a personage is unknown to history; and there is no reason why she should be mentioned rather than the king; and persona are not introduced by name in prophecy except for some very special reason, as Cyrus (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). The alternative rendering, "it is decreed," adopted by Keil, Pusey, and many modern commentators, is unexampled, and comes in baldly, and not at all according to the prophet's manner. Henderson joins the clause with the proceiling, thus: "The palace is dissolved, though firmly established."

The cruelty of the Assyrians is attested by the monuments, in which we see or read how prisoners were impaled alive, flayed, beheaded, dragged to death with ropes passed through rings in their lips, blinded by the king's own hand, hung up by hands or feet to die in slow torture (see Bonomi, pp. 168, etc., 190, etc., 225). Others have their brains beaten out, or their tongues torn out by the roots, while the bleeding heads of the slain are tied round the necks of the living, who are reserved for further torture (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 456; Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:503, etc., edit. 1864).

The Assyrians used treachery in furthering their conquests, made promises which they never kept, to induce nations to submit to their yoke. Such, doubtless, were those of Rabshakeh (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16</a>). Rawlinson, "Falsehood and treachery...  are often employed by the strong, as furnishing short cuts to success, and even, where the moral standard is low, as being in themselves creditable (see Thucyd., 3:83). It certainly was not necessity which made the Assyrians covenant breakers; it seems to have been in part the wantonness of power - because they 'despised the cities, and regarded no man' (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>); perhaps it was in part also their imperfect moral perception, which may have failed to draw the proper distinction between craft and cleverness" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 1:305). <span class="cmt_word">Robbery</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rapine</span>, or <span class="accented">rending in pieces.</span> The figure applies to the way in which a wild beast kills its prey by tearing it to pieces.

The Vulgate is correct, <span class="accented">dilaceratione plena</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The prey departeth not.</span> They go on in the same way, gathering spoil into the city, never ceasing from this crime.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The cause is given that has brought this punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms.</span> This term is commonly applied to idolatry, the swerving from the true God and turning to false deities; and it is thought that it cannot be used in that sense here, as Assyria had always worshipped idols, and could not be said to have forsaken or proved false to the Lord. Hence Hitzig, Keil, and others refer the term to the treacherous friendship and crafty politics by which Nineveh ensnared other states, seeking really only her own interests (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>). But this habit of treachery has been already mentioned in ver. 1 (where see note); and, as Knabenbauer remarks, the Assyrians used no meretricious blandishments to effect their conquests, but the cruel arts of war and the stern ordeal of the sword. It is scarcely probable that the prophet would omit idolatry among the crimes of the Assyrians that called for vengeance, as all their wars were carried on in the name of their gods, and the monarchs professed to be under Divine protection and influence. The term "whoredom" is applied to the idolatry, not only of the Israelites, but to that of Jezebel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>), who was always a heathen. The idolatry of the Assyrians may very well be so called, because it was a wilful ignoring of the light of nature and natural religion (see Wisd. 13:1; <a href="../../par/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>, etc.). They were careful, too, wherever they carried their arms, to erect there symbols of their deities, and to compel conquered nations to receive them and pay them Divine honour. With this idolatrous worship was associated that gross immorality which even Herodotus (1:199) termed utterly disgraceful (comp. Baruch 6:43). Rightly is Nineveh called <span class="cmt_word">the well favoured harlot</span>; for her splendour and magnificence were unsurpassed, dazzling all beholders and hiding the rottenness that lay below the surface. <span class="cmt_word">The mistress of witchcrafts.</span> She was skilful in employing every art to seduce nations to her side. We hear much of magic in connection with Babylon and the Chaldeans, but not in reference especially to Assyria.

This is the celebrated Thebes, in Upper Egypt, called in Egyptian Pa-Amun, "the House of Amun," and in the inscriptions Ni, which is the same word as No. The name Amon is attached because that god was particularly worshipped there. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> ("a portion of or for Ammon"), translating the word "No." St. Jerome, misled by his Hebrew teacher, renders, "Alexandria populorum," as if Thebes stood on the site of the much later city of Alexandria; whereas we see from Assurbanipal's annals that he was forty days marching from Memphis, where he defeated Rudammon, to Thebes (see G. Smith, 'Assurbanipal,' p. 55). On the grandeur and magnificence of this city, Denon (quoted by Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:309, note 7), writes, "On est fatigue d'ecrire, on est fatigue de lire, on est epouvante de la pensee d'une telle conception; on ne peut croire, meme apres l'avoir vu, a la realite de l'existence de tant de constructions reunies sur un meme point, a leurs dimensions, a la constance obstinee qu'a exigee leur fabrication, aux depenses incalculables de taut de somptuosite" ('Egypte,' 2:226). "In the long and rich valley of the Lower Nile, which extends above five hundred miles from Syene to Memphis, almost any situation might furnish a site for a great city, since, except at Silsilis and at the Gebelein, the valley is never less than two miles wide, the soil is always fertile, good quarries are always at hand, and lavish Nature is so bounteous with her gifts that abundant sustenance can at any point be obtained for a large population. But in this wealth of eligible sites, there are still degrees of eligibility - spots which Nature has distinguished by special favour, and, as it were, marked out for greatness and celebrity. Such a position is that which the traveller reaches when, passing through the gorge of the Gebelein, he emerges upon the magnificent plain, at least ten miles in width, through which the river flows with a course from southwest to northeast for a distance of some forty miles between Erment and Qobt. Here, for the first time since quitting the Nubian desert, does the Nile enter upon a wide and ample space. On either side the hills recede, and a broad green plain, an alluvium of the richest description, spreads itself out on both banks of the stream, dotted with <span class="accented">dom</span> and date palms, sometimes growing singly, sometimes collected into clumps or groves. Here, too, there open out on either side, to the east and to the west, lines of route offering great advantages for trade, on the one hand with the Lesser Oasis and so with the tribes of the African interior, on the other with the western coast of the Red Sea and the spice region of the opposite shore. In the valley of Hammamat, down which passed the ancient route to the coast, are abundant supplies of <span class="accented">breccia verde</span> and of other valuable and rare kinds of stone, while at no great distance to the right and left of the route lie mines of gold, silver, and lead, anciently prolific, though exhausted now for many ages. Somewhat more remote, yet readily accessible by a frequented route, was the emerald region of Gebel Zabara, where the mines are still worked" (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Egypt,' 2:124, etc.). Thebes was situated on both banks of the Nile, the principal portion lying on the east; the Necropolis and Memnonia were on the west. It seems never to have been surrounded with a wall (notwithstanding its "hundred gates"), the river and canals forming a sufficient defence. At the present time the ruins are some twenty-seven miles in circuit, including Luxor and the remains of the great temple at Karnak. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Nile formed its rampart.

Luhim are the Lybians, dwelling on the west of the Canopic mouth of the Nile. Thus the enumeration of the forces of Thebes is regularly arranged, beginning with the south, Ethiopia, then through Egypt proper to the north, and then to the provinces on the east and west (Knabenbauer).

The first time it is merely recorded that the soldiers, under the commander of the satraps, made a slaughter in the city. The second capture is thus described in the monarch's own tablet (Brugsch, 'Egypt,' 1:272-275, Eng. transl.): "Urdamaneh fled alone, and entered Thebes, the city of his kingdom...  I directed my march in pursuit of him. I came to Thebes. He saw the strength of my army, and left Thebes, and fled to the city of Kipkip. Of that whole city (Thebes), with thanksgiving to Asur and Istar, my hands took the complete possession. Silver, gold, metals, stones, all the treasures of its palace whatsoever, dyed garments of before and linen, great horses [elephants?] men and women, great and small, works of zakah [basalt?] and marble, their kelal and manzas, the gates of their palace...  I tare away and carried to Assyria. I made spoil of the animals of the land without number, and carried them forth in the midst out of Thebes I caused a catalogue to be made of the spoil.

So Strabo (11:12. 13) speaks of certain mountain passes as "the Caspian gates" and Xenophon ('Anab.' 1:4. 4) mentions "the gates of Cilicia and Syria." The famous defile that led into Greece was called Thermopylae The fire shall devour thy bars. Hitzig, Keil, and others take the "bars" metaphorically, meaning the forts and castles which defend the passes; but the literal sense is the most natural, as in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a> (see note on Amos 1:5). It was the Assyrians' custom to set fire to the gates  of any city that they attacked (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 178, 185, 192). "It is incontestable," says Bonomi, in another place, "that, during the excavations, a considerable quantity of charcoal, and even pieces of wood either half burnt or in a perfect state of preservation, were found in many places. The lining of the chambers also bears certain marks of the action of fire. All these things can be explained only by supposing the fall of a burning roof, which calcined the slabs of gypsum, and converted them into dust .... It must have been a violent and prolonged fire to be able to calcine not only a few places, but every part of these slabs, which were ten feet high and several inches thick. So complete a decomposition can be attributed but to intense heat" (ibid., p. 213).

This injunction is not particularly applicable to Nineveh, which from its situation was abundantly supplied with water, unless there was danger that the enemy would divert the courses of the rivers. But the warning would come home with peculiar force to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, among whom Nahum prophesied (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fortify thy strong holds</span>; <span class="accented">strengthen thy fortresses.</span> Repair all defects in thy defences (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a>). The mode of doing this in the Assyrian fashion is then denoted. <span class="cmt_word">Go into clay, and tread the mortar.</span> The soil round Nineveh was of a tenacious quality; and when moistened with water and kneaded either with feet or hands, with the addition usually of a little chopped straw, was easily formed into bricks. These, even without the aid of fire, became dry and hard in the course of a few days. But it is plain from the investigations of ruins that the Assyrians used both kiln-baked and sun-dried bricks, though the mass of the walls was usually composed of the latter, the more durable material being employed merely as an accessory (see Bouomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 9; Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:252). Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 3:4. 11, speaks of the brick wall (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of a town he calls Mespila. <span class="cmt_word">Make strong the brick kiln.</span> There is an uncertainty about the meaning of the last word (<span class="accented">malben</span>), which occurs only in two other places (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>). In the latter passage it may possibly mean "a square" or "open quadrangle." Jerome has, <span class="accented">tene laterem</span>; the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "make them strong above (equivalent to 'stronger than') brick," connecting it with the following verse. Some translate it, "brick mould." If the Anglican Version is correct, the prophet bids them repair their kilns, unused in the days of prosperity, when they had no need to look to the security of their walls. Virtually the same sense is elicited by rendering, "lay hold of the brick mould." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There</span>. In the very place where thou hast taken all these precautions. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the fire devour thee.</span> That fire played a great part in the destruction of Nineveh is asserted by historians and proved by the remains of the city discovered in modern times (see note on ver. 13: also Herod., 1:106; Diod. Sic., 2:25-28; Athen., 12:529). The fate of the last king, who burnt himself and his palace, is a well known story (see Justin, 'Hist.,' 1:3; Eusebius, 'Chronicles,' 1:9; 14:3; 15:7; Syncell., 'Chronicles,' 1:396, edit. Dind.) (Kuabenbauer). <span class="cmt_word">The sword shall cut thee off.</span> While fire destroys the buildings, the sword shall devour the inhabitants of the city. <span class="cmt_word">The cankerworm;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the licker</span> (<a href="../../par/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>). The locust in its earlier stage is thus described (see ver. 16). The figure implies that the destruction of Nineveh should be sudden and complete, as that wrought on vegetation by an inroad of locusts. <span class="cmt_word">Make thyself many.</span> Collect thine armies, gather hosts as innumerable as the locusts, it will be all in vain. The "cankerworm" represented the enemy; the "locusts" represent the Assyrians themselves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nahum/3-16.htm">Nahum 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Its extensive commercial relations shall not save it. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants.</span> Nineveh was most favourably situated for carrying on commerce with other countries. The roads from Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, and Phoenicia, that led into Media, Persia, and the interior of Asia, converged at Nineveh, and brought thither merchandise from all lands; and the Assyrians themselves exported their own produce and manufactures to the far West. Among these are enumerated textile fabrics, carpets, dyed attire, and embroidered work, carvings in ivory, gems, spices (see Rawlinson, 'Anc. Mon.,' 2:179, etc.; Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:414, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The cankerworm spoileth;</span> or, <span class="accented">spreadeth itself</span> for plunder; Vulgate, <span class="accented">expansus est</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "attacked." The cankerworm (see note on ver. 15) are the enemy,who spread themselves over the rich produce of Nineveh, and then <span class="cmt_word">flee away</span> laden with spoil. Pusey makes the cankerworm represent Nineveh. She spread herself everywhere wasting and plundering, and now she is gone, has disappeared. But the former explanation  better suits the comparison in ver. 15, where "the licker" is the enemy; and it is most natural that the prophet should allude to the fate of that commercial wealth which he has just mentioned, as in previous verses he contrasts the riches and power of Nineveh with the ruin that awaits them.

The Anglican Version derives the word from <span class="accented">nezer</span>, "a diadem," and "the crowned" are the officials of upper rank. "High officers of state in Assyria were adorned with diadems, closely resembling the lower baud of the royal mitre, separated from the cap itself. Very commonly the head was encircled with a simple fillet or hoop, probably of gold, without any adornment" (Gosse, 'Assyria,' p. 463, quoted by Strauss; see the figures in Bonomi, p. 319). Others derive it from <span class="accented">nazar.</span> "to separate," in the signification of "those separated or selected for war."

Knabenbauer (referring to Strassmaier's Assyrian vocabulary) considers the word to be a transliteration (<span class="accented">ss</span> being resolved into <span class="accented">ne</span>) of the Assyrian <span class="accented">ma-as-sa-ru</span>, which means "guardian," or some inferior officer. With this agrees the Vulgate <span class="accented">custodes. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As the locusts;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in multitude. That the number of captains and superior officers would be very great may be conjectured from the inscriptions which sometimes enumerate the captives carried off from conquered countries. Thus in the account of the capture of some insignificant nation, the then king boasts that he took away 13,000 fighting men, 1121 captains, and 460 superior officers (Strauss, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The prophet's meaning is that if the officers, etc., are so numerous, the multitude of soldiers and civilians must be truly immense. <span class="cmt_word">Thy captains.</span> <span class="accented">Taphsar</span> is an Assyrian word, occurring only in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>. It is probably the same as <span class="accented">dupsarru</span> or <span class="accented">dipsarru</span> of the inscriptions, and is taken to signify "a scribe" (see Sehrader, p. 424) Such officials are often represented on the monuments (see Layard, 2:184), and seem sometimes to have been of high or priestly rank. Jerome translates, <span class="accented">parvuli</span> <span class="accented">tui</span>, though in Jeremiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, he retains the Assyrian word.
