Rawlinson does not identify the site; George Smith regards it as "the capital of Sargon, the great city Agadi, near the city of Sippara on the Euphrates, and north of Babylon ('Assyrian Discoveries,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And Calneh</span>.

With this the record of Nimrod s achievements closes. It is generally supposed that Nimrod flourished either before or about the time of the building of the tower of Babel; but Prof. Chwolsen of St. Petersburg, in his 'Ueber die Ueberreste der Altbabylon-ischen <span class="accented">Literatur</span>,' brings the dynasty of Nimrod down as late as , relying principally on the evidence of an original work composed by Qut ami, a native Babylonian, and translated by Ibnwa hachijah, a descendant of the Chaldaeans, and assigned by Chwolsen to one of the earlier periods of Babylonian history, in which is mentioned the name of Nemrod, or Nemroda, as the founder of a Canaanite dynasty which ruled at Babylon (vide an excellent paper on this subject in Turner's 'Biblical and Oriental Studies,' Edin., A. and C. Black, 1876). Perhaps the hardest difficulty to explain in connection with the ordinary date assigned to Nimrod is the fact that in <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, which speaks of the reigning monarchs in the Euphrates valley, there is no account taken of Nineveh and its king - a circumstance which has been supposed to import that the founding of the capital of Assyria could not have been anterior to the days of Abraham. But early Babylonian texts confirm what <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>. seems to imply - the fact of an Elamite conquest of Babylonia,  <span class="date">B.C. 2280</span>, by Kudur-nanhundi (Kudurlagamar, the Chederlaomer of Genesis), who carried off an image of the goddess Nana from the city Erech (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Assyrian Discoveries,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3.), so that this difficulty may be held to have disappeared before the light of archaeological discovery. But at whatever period Nimrod flourished, the Biblical narrative would lead us to anticipate a commingling of Hamitic and Shemitic tongues in the Euphrates valley, which existing monuments confirm (cf. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 3).

Against the Egyptian origin of the Philistines the possession of a Shemitic tongue and the non-observance of circumcision have been urged; but the first may have been acquired from the conquered Avim whose land they occupied (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-28.htm">Deuteronomy 2:28</a>), and the exodus from Egypt may have taken place prior to the institution of the rite in question. <span class="cmt_word">And Caphtorim.</span> Cappadocia (Bochart), Syrtis Major (Clericus), Crete (Calmer, Ewald), Cyprus (Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller), Coptos, Kouft or Keft, a few miles north of Thebes (Kalisch).

This tower is commonly identified with the temple of Belus, which Herodotus describes (1. 181) as being quadrangular (two stadia each way), and having gates of brass, with a solid tower in the middle, consisting of eight sections, each a stadium in height, placed one above another, ascended by a spiral staircase, and having in the top section a spacious temple with a golden table and a well-furnished bed. Partially destroyed by Xerxes ( <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>), it was attempted unsuccessfully to be rebuilt by Alexander the Great; but the remaining portion of the edifice was known to be in existence five centuries later, and was sufficiently imposing to be recognized as the temple of Belus (Pliny, 6:30). The site of this ancient tower is supposed by George Smith to be covered by the ruin "Babil," a square mound about 200 yards each way, in the north of the city; and that of the tower of Babel to be occupied by the ruin Birs-Nimrod (situated six miles south-west of Hillah, which is about forty miles west of Bagdad), a tower consisting of seven stages, said by inscriptions on cylinders extracted from the ruin to have been "the Temple of the Seven Planets, which had been partially built by a former king of Babylon, and, having fallen into decay, was restored and completed by Nebuchadnezzar" ('Assyrian Discoveries,' 12. p. 59; 'Chaldaean Genesis,' p. 163; cf. Layard's 'Nineveh and Babylon,' chap. 22. p. 496). It is, however, <span class="accented">prima facie</span>, unlikely that either Babil or Birs-Nimrod is the exact site of Babel. The original building was never finished, and may not have attained any great dimensions. Perhaps the most that can be said is that these existing mounds enable us to picture what sort of erection the tower of Babel was to be. <span class="cmt_word">And let us make a name</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>; neither an idol temple, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> being   =   God, which it never is without the article, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>  - cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a> (Jewish writers); nor a monument, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> (Clericus); nor a metropolis, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a> (Clericus); nor a tower that might serve as a sign to guide the wandering nomads and guard them against getting lost when spread abroad with their flocks, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-13.htm">Isaiah 55:13</a> (Perizonius, Dathe, Ilgen); but a name, a reputation, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-12.htm">Isaiah 63:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a> (Luther, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth, Kalisch).

We may even suppose that, prior to the building of Babel, if any of the human family had begun to spread themselves abroad upon the surface of the globe, a slight diversity in human speech had begun to show itself; and the truthfulness of the narrative will in no wise be endangered by admitting that the Divine interposition at Babel may have consisted in quickening a natural process which had already commenced to operate; nay, we are rather warranted to conclude that the whole work of subdividing human speech was not compressed into a moment of time, but, after receiving this special impulse, was left to develop and complete itself as the nations wandered farther and ever farther from the plains of Shinar (cf. Kurtz, 'Hist. of the Old Covenant,' vol. 1. pp. 108-117 (Clark's For. Theol. Lib.), and 'Quarry on Genesis,' pp. 195-206). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>CHALDAEAN LEGEND OF THE TOWER OF BABEL. Berosus, indeed, does not refer to it, and early writers are obliged to have recourse to somewhat doubtful authorities to confirm it. Eusebius, e.g., quotes Abydenus as saying that "not long after the Flood, the ancient race of men were so puffed up with their strength and tallness of stature that they began to despise and contemn the gods, and labored to erect that very lofty tower which is now called Babylon, intending thereby to scale the heaven& But when the building approached the sky, behold, the gods called in the aid of the winds, and by their help overturned the tower, and cast it to the ground! The name of the ruin is still called Babel, because until this time all men had used the same speech; but now there was sent upon them a confusion of many and diverse tongues" ('Praep. Ev.,' 9:14). But the diligence of the late George Smith has been rewarded by discovering the fragment of an Assyrian tablet (marked If, 3657 in British Museum) containing an account of the building of the tower, in which the gods are represented as being angry at the work and confounding the speech of the builders.

First named on account of his spiritual pre-eminence. If Abram was Terah's eldest son, then, as Abram was seventy-five years of age when Terah died (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), Terah's whole life could only have been 145 years. But Terah lived to the age of 205 years (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>); therefore Abram was born in Terah's 130th year. This, however, makes it surprising that Abraham should have reckoned it impossible for him to have a son at 100 years (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>); only, after having lived so long in childless wedlock, it was not strange that he should feel somewhat doubtful of any issue by Sarai. Kalisch believes that Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4</a>) made a mistake in saying Terah died before his son's migration from Charran, and that he really survived that event by sixty years; while the Samaritan text escapes the difficulty by shortening the life of Terah to 145 years. <span class="cmt_word">And Nahor</span>, who must have been younger than Haran, since he married Haran's daughter. <span class="cmt_word">And Haran</span>, who, as the eldest, must have been born in Terah's seventieth year. Thus the second family register, like the flint, concludes after ten generations with the birth of three sons, who, like Noah's, are mentioned not in the order of their ages, but of their spiritual pre-eminence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> From this table it appears that 292 years, according to the Hebrew text, passed away between the Flood and the birth, or 292 +75   =    =   367 between the Flood and the call of Abraham. Reckoning, however, the age of Torah at Abram's birth as 130 (<span class="accented">vide</span>  Exposition), the full period between the Deluge and the patriarch's departure from Haran will be 367 + 60   =    =   427 years, which, allowing five pairs to each family, Murphy computes, would in the course of ten generations yield a population of 15,625,000 souls; or, supposing a rate of increase equal to that of Abraham's posterity in Egypt during the 400 years that elapsed from the call to the exodus, the inhabitants of the world in the time of Abraham would be between seven and eight millions. It must, however, be remembered that an element of uncertainty enters into all computations based upon even the Hebrew text. The age of Terah at the birth (apparently) of Abram is put down at seventy. But it admits of demonstration that Abram was born in the 130th year of Terah. What guarantee then do we possess that in every instance the registered son was the firstborn? In the case of Arphaxad this is almost implied in the statement that he was born two years after the Flood. But if the case of Eber were parallel with that of Terah, and Joktan were the son that he begat in his thirty-fourth year, then obviously the birth of Peleg, like that of Abram, may have happened sixty years later; in which case it is apparent that any reckoning which proceeded on the minute verbal accuracy of the registered numbers would be entirely at fault. This consideration might have gone far to explain the wide divergence between the numbers of the Samaritan and Septuagint as compared with the Hebrew text, had it not been that they both agree with it in setting down seventy as the age of Terah at the date of Abram's birth. The palpable artificiality also of these later tables renders them even less worthy of credit than the Hebrew. The introduction by the LXX. of Cainan as the son of Arphaxad, though seemingly confirmed by Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35, 36</a>), is clearly an interpolation. It does not occur in the LXX. version of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-24.htm">1 Chronicles 1:24</a>, and is not found in either the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Targums or the ancient versions, in Josephus or Philo, or in the Codex Beza of the Gospel of Luke. Its appearance in Luke (and probably also in the LXX.) can only be explained as an interpolation. Wordsworth is inclined to regard it as authentic in Luke, and to suppose that Cainaan was excluded from the Mosaic table either to render it symmetrical, as Luke's table is rendered symmetrical by its insertion, or because of some moral offence, which, though necessitating his expulsion from a Hebrew register, would not prevent his reappearance in his proper place under the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The term Ur has been explained to be identical with It, a city (Rawlinson); the Zend Vare, a fortress (Gesenius); <span class="accented">Ur</span>, the light country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of the sun-rising (Furst); and even <span class="accented">Ur, <[Vol 1/Genesis/173]PGBR></span> fire, with special reference to the legendary furnace already referred to (Talmudists). Whether a district (LXX., Lange, Kalisch) or a city (Josephus, Eusebius, Onkelos, Drnsius, Keil, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), its exact site is uncertain. Rival claimants for the honor of representing it have appeared in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a Persian fortress (Persicum Castellum) of the name of Ur, mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus (75. 100. 8) as lying between Nisibis and the Tigris (Bochart, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the modern Orfah, the Edsssa of the Greeks, situated "on one of the bare, rugged spurs which descend from the mountains of Armenia into the Assyrian plains" (Stanley's 'Jewish Church,' 1:7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hur, the most important of the early capitals of Chaldaea, now the ruins of Mugheir, at no great distance from the mouth, and six miles to the west, of the Euphrates (Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, 16; Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' 12:233; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 9). Yet none of them is quite exempt from difficulty. A military fort, to take the first-named location, does not appear a suitable or likely place for a nomade horde to settle in; while the second has been reckoned too near Charran, the first place of encampment of the emigrants; and the third, besides being exceedingly remote from Charran, scarcely harmonises with Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrim (Acts 7:2). Unless, therefore, Stephen meant Chaldsea when he said Mesopotamia (Dykes), and Abraham could speak of Northern Mesopotamia as his country (Genesis 24:4), when in reality he belonged to Southern Babylonia, the identification of Ur of the Chaldees with the Mugheir ruin though regarded with most favor by archaeologists, will continue to be doubtful; while, if the clan march commenced at Edessa, it will always require an effort to account for their coming to a halt so soon after starting and so near home; and the Nisibis station, though apparently more suitable than either in respect of distance, will remain encumbered with its own peculiar difficulties. It would seem, therefore, as if the exact situation of the patriarchal town or country must be left undetermined until further light can be obtained.

Distinguished as a man of undoubted superiority both of character and mind, the head of at least two powerful and important races, and standing, as one might say, on the threshold of the historical era, it is yet chiefly as his life and fortunes connect with the Divine purpose of salvation that they find a place in the inspired record. The progress of infidelity during the four centuries that had elapsed since the Flood, the almost universal corruption of even the Shemits portion of the human family, had conclusively demonstrated the necessity of a second Divine interposition, if the knowledge of salvation were not to be completely banished from the earth. Accordingly, the son of Terah was selected to be the founder of a new nation, in which the light of gospel truth might be deposited for preservation until the fullness of the times, and through which the promise of the gospel might he conducted forward to its ultimate realization in the manifestation of the woman's seed. Partly to prepare him for the high destiny of being the progenitor of the chosen nation, and partly to illustrate the character of that gospel with which he was to be entrusted, he was summoned to renounce his native country and kinsmen in Chaldaea, and venture forth upon an untried journey in obedience to the call of Heaven, to a land which he should afterward receive for an inheritance. In a series of successive theophanies or Divine manifestations, around which the various incidents of his life are grouped - in Ur of the Chaldees (<a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), at Moreh in Canaan (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), near Bethel (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 13.), at Mature (ibid. 15, 17.), and on Moriah (ibid. 22.) - he is distinctly promised three things - a land, a seed, and a blessing  - as the reward of his compliance with the heavenly invitation; and the confident persuasion both of the reality of these gracious promises and of the Divine ability and willingness to fulfill them forms the animating spirit and guiding principle of his being in every situation of life, whether of trial or of difficulty, in which he is subsequently placed. The miraculous character of these theophanies indeed has been made a ground on which to assail the entire patriarchal history as unhistorical. By certain writers they have been represented as nothing more than natural occurrences embellished by the genius of the author of Genesis (Eichhorn, Bauer, Winer), as belonging to the domain of poetical fiction (De Wette), and therefore as undeserving of anything like serious consideration. But unless the supernatural is <span class="accented">to be in toto</span> eliminated from the record, a concession which cannot possibly be granted by an enlightened theism, the Divine appearances to Abraham cannot be regarded as in any degree militating against the historical veracity of the story of his life, which, it may be said, is amply vouched for by the harmony of its details with the characteristics of the period to which it belongs (cf. Havernick's 'Introduction,' &sect; 18). Nor does the employment of the name Jehovah in connection with these theophanies warrant the conclusion that the passages containing them are interpolations of a post Mosaic or Jehovistic editor (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson). "Such a hypothesis," says Keil, "can only be maintained by those who' misunderstand the distinctive meaning of the two names, Elohim and Jehovah (q.v. on Genesis 2:4), and arbitrarily set aside the Jehovah in <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, on account of an erroneous determination of the relation in which El Shaddai stands to Jehovah." Indications of the literary unity of the patriarchal history will be noted, and replies to objections given, in the progress of the Exposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Lord.</span> Jehovah   =   the God of salvation, an indication that the narrative is now to specially concern itself with the chosen seed, and the Deity to discover himself as the God of redemption. The hypothesis that vers. 1-4 were inserted in the fundamental document by the Jehovist editor is not required for a satisfactory explanation of the change of the Divine name at this particular stage of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Had said</span>. Literally, said. In Ur of the Chaldees, according to Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), reverting, after the usual manner of the writer, to the original point of departure in the Abrahamic history (Aben Ezra, Mede, Piscator, Pererius, Calvin, Willet, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Dathins, Alford, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'); or in Haran, after Terah's death, as the first call given to the patriarch (LXX., Chaldee, Syriac, Raschi, Lyra, Keil, Kalisch, Dykes), or as a repetition of the call addressed to him in Ur (Clarke, Wordsworth, Inglis). Luther conjectures that the call in Ur was given "<span class="accented">fortasse per patti</span>. <span class="accented">archam Shem</span>;" but if the authority of Stephen be recognized, this was the occasion of the first theophany vouchsafed to Abram. <span class="cmt_word">Get thee out.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">go for thyself</span>, a frequent Hebraism, expressive of the way in which the action of the verb returns upon itself, is terminated and completed (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrew Syntax,' &sect; 314); hence, though not necessarily emphatic, it may be equivalent to "Go thou," whoever else remains behind (Jarchi, Ainsworth, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">Of thy country</span>. A proof that the date of the call was while Abram was in Ur (Calvin), though if Ur was at Edessa (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) the patriarch could scarcely have been said to be from home. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy kindred.</span> At Ur in all probability Nahor and Milcah were left behind; at Haran, Nahor and his family, if they had already arrived thither, and according to some (Kalisch, Dykes) Terah also. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy father's house.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> if they will not accompany thee. No Divine interdict forbade the other members of the family of Terah joining in the Abrahamic emigration. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">land that I will show thee.</span> Through a revelation (Lange), or simply by the guidance of providence. The land itself is left unnamed for the trial of the patriarch's faith, which, if it sustained the proof, was to be rewarded by the exceeding great and precious promises which follow:  - according to one arrangement, seven in number, one for each clause of the next two verses (Cajetan, Willet); according to another, four, corresponding to the clauses of the second verse, the last of which is expanded in the third (Keil); according to a third, six, forming three pairs of parallels (Alford); according to a fourth, and perhaps the best, two, a lower or personal blessing, comprising the first three particulars, and a higher or public blessing, embracing the last three (Murphy).

The sense in which Abram was to be a source of blessing to others is explained in the next verse. First, men were to be either blessed or cursed of God according as their attitude to Abram was propitious or hostile. <span class="cmt_word">And I will bless them</span>  - grace expecting they will be many to bless (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">that bless thee, and curse</span> (with a judicial curse, the word being the same as in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">him</span> - only an individual here and there, in the judgment of the Deity, being likely to inherit this malediction (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">that curseth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">treateth lightly</span> or <span class="accented">despiseth</span> The verb is applied in <a href="../../par/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a> to the diminution of the waters of the flood) <span class="cmt_word">thee</span>. The Divine Being thus identifies himself with Abram, and solemnly engages to regard Abrams friends and enemies as his, as Christ does with his Church (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> Not Mess themselves by thee or in thy name (Jarchi, Clericus); but in thee, as the progenitor of the promised seed, shall all the families of the ground (which was cursed on account of sin, Genesis ill 17) be spiritually blessed - cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a> (Calvin, Luther, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Wordsworth, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary').

The arrangement here referred to appears (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a>) to have been preconcerted on first setting out from Ur or Haran, so that Abram's address to his wife on approaching Egypt may be viewed as simply a reminder of their previous compact. <span class="cmt_word">Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">fair of aspect</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>). Though now upwards of sixty-five years of age, she was still in middle life (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-1.htm">Genesis 23:1</a>), and her constitution had not been impaired by bearing children. Besides, the clear complexion of Sarah would render her specially attractive in the eyes of the Egyptians, whose women, though not so dark as the Nubians and Ethiopians, were yet of a browner tinge than the Syrians and Arabians. Monumental evidence confirms the assertion of Scripture that a fair complexion was deemed a high recommendation in the age of the Pharaohs (<span class="accented">ride</span> Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 200). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that</span>) the Egyptians - notorious for their licentiousness (<span class="accented">vide</span> P.

The usual apologies, that he did not fabricate, but "cautiously conceal the truth" (Lyra), that perhaps he acted in obedience to a Divine impulse (Mede), that he dissembled in order to protect his wife's chastity (Rosenm&uuml;ller), are not satisfactory. On the other hand, Abram must not be judged by the light of New Testament revelation. It is not necessary for a Christian in every situation Of life to tell all the truth, especially when its part suppression involves no deception, and is indispensable for self-preservation; and Abram may have deemed it legitimate as a means of securing both his own life and Sarah's honor, though how he was to shield his wife in the peculiar circumstances it is difficult to see. Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests that he knew the preliminary ceremonies to marriage required a considerable time, and counted upon being able to leave Egypt before any injury was done to Sarah. The only objection to this is that the historian represents him as being less solicitous about the preservation of his wife's chastity than about the conservation of his own life. <span class="cmt_word">That it may be well</span> (not with thee, though doubtless this is implied, but) <span class="cmt_word">with me for thy sake</span> (the import of which is declared in the words which follow); <span class="cmt_word">and my soul shall live because of thee</span>.

Not a titular designation, like Augustus, Pharaoh, or Malek-ol-adel (<span class="accented">rexjustus</span>) of the Mohammedan kings (Cajetan), but the name of a person; neither an angel (Origen), nor the Holy Ghost (Hieracas), nor some great Divine power (the Melchisedecians), all of which interpretations are baseless conjectures; nor Christ (Ambrose), which is contrary to <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>; Norghem (Targums, Lyre, Willet, Luther, Ainsworth), which <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a> sufficiently negatives; but most probably a Canaanitish prince by whom the true faith was retained amid the gloom of surrounding heathenism (Josephus, Irenaeus, Eusebius, Calvin, A Lapide, Delitzsch, Keil, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Candlish, Bush), though it has been suggested that "the enlightenment of the king of Salem was but a ray of the sun of Abram's faith" (Kalisch), an opinion difficult to harmonize with <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">King of Salem</span>   =   "king of peace (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1</a>). The capital of Melchisedeck was either Jerusalem, of which the ancient name was Salem, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> (Josephus, Onkelos, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Bush); or a city on the other side Jordan en <span class="accented">route</span> from Damascus to Sodom (Ewald); or, though less likely, as being too remote from Sodom and the king's dale, Salem in the tribe of Ephraim, a city near Scythopolis, where the ruins of Melchisedeck's palace were said to exist (Jerome), and near to which John baptized (Bochart). <span class="cmt_word">Brought forth bread and wine.</span> As a refreshment to the patriarch and his soldiers (Josephus, Calvin, Clarke, Rosenm&uuml;ller), which, however, was the less necessary since the spoils of the conquered foe were in possession of Abram and his men (Kalisch); hence mainly as a symbol, not of his transference of the soil of Canaan to the patriarch, bread and wine being the chief productions of the ground (Lightfoot), or of his gratitude to Abram, who had recovered for the land peace, freedom, and prosperity (Delitzsch), or of the institution of the Supper by the Lord Jesus Christ (Bush); but of the priestly benediction which followed and of the spiritual refreshment which it conferred upon the soul of Abram (Kalisch, Murphy). The Romish idea, that the act of Melchisedeck was sacrificial, is precluded by the statement that he brought forth the bread and wine before the people, and not before God. <span class="cmt_word">And he was the priest</span>. <span class="accented">Cohen</span>; one who undertakes another's cause, hence one who acts as mediator between God and man, though the primary signification of the root is doubtful and disputed. The necessity for this office has its ground in the sinfulness of man, which disqualifies him for direct intercourse with a holy Being (cf. Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship,' ch. 1. b.). The occurrence of this term, here mentioned for the flint time, implies the existence of a regularly-constituted form of worship by means of priests and sacrifice. Hence the Mosaic cultus afterwards instituted may only have been a resuscitation and further development of what had existed from the beginning. <span class="cmt_word">Of the most high God.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">El-Ellen</span>, a proper name for the Supreme Deity (occurring only here, in the narrative of Abram's interview with the kings); of which the first term, <span class="accented">El</span>, from the same root as Elohim (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, q.v.), signifies the Strong One, and is seldom applied to God without some qualifying attribute or cognomen, as El-Shaddai, or El, the God of Israel; and the second, '<span class="accented">Elion</span> (occurring frequently afterwards, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Psalms 9:2), describes God as the High, the Highest, the Exalted, the Supreme, and is sometimes used in conjunction with Jehovah (Psalm. 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), and with Elohim (Psalm 57:3 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 57:2<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), while sometimes it stands alone (Psalm 21:8 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 21:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). Most probably the designation here describes the name under which the Supreme Deity was worshipped by Melchisedeck and the king of Sodom, whom Abram recognizes as followers of the true God by identifying, as in Ver. 22, El-Elion with Jehovah (cf. Quarry, p. 426).

That this was a personal designation of the pre-incarnate Logos, if not susceptible of complete demonstration, yet receives not a little sanction from the language employed throughout this narrative (cf.

Biblically viewed, the vision, as distinguished from the ordinary dream, defines the presentation to the bodily senses or to the mental consciousness of  objects usually beyond the sphere of their  natural activities; hence visions might be  imparted in dreams (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>), or in  trances (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Fear not, Abram.</span> With allusion, doubtless, to the patriarch's mental dejection, which was probably occasioned by the natural re action consequent upon his late high-pitched  excitement (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), which  might lead him to anticipate either a war of  revenge from the Asiatic monarchs (Jonathan), or an assault from the heathen Canaanites, already jealous of his growing power,  or perhaps both. Wordsworth observes that the words here addressed to Abram are commonly employed in Scripture to introduce  announcements of Christ (<a href="../../par/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>; cf.

Wordsworth detects in the non-dividing of the birds an emblem of "the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of peace and love; which is a Spirit of unity, and of "Christ's human spirit, which was not divisible." Kalisch, with more probability, recognizes as the reason of their not being divided the fact that such division was not required, both fowls being regarded as one part of the sacrifice only, and each, as the half, being placed opposite the other. Wordsworth numbers seven parts in the sacrifice, and sees a symbol of completeness and finality, the number seven being the root of <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to swear (Gesenius, p. 802); Kalisch reckons four, which he regards as "denoting perfection, but rather the external perfection of form than the internal one of the mind," and pointing "to the perfect possession of the Holy Land." The ritual here described is the same which was afterwards observed among the Hebrews in the formation of covenants (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-18.htm">Genesis 34:18</a>), and appears to have extensively prevailed among heathen nations (cf.

The act of scaring the voracious birds has been taken to represent the ease with which Abram or Israel would ward off his enemies (Jonathan, Targums, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush); the averting of destruction from the Israelites through Abram's merit (Kalisch, Keil); Abram's religious regard for and observance of God's treaty (Wordsworth); the patriarch's expectation that God was about to employ the sacrificial victims for some holy purpose (Alford); simply his anxiety to preserve the victims pure and un-mutilated for whatever end they might have to serve (Murphy).

Calvin notes that Sarai s desire of offspring was not prompted by natural impulse, but by the zeal of faith which made her wish to secure the promised benediction. As yet it had not been clearly intimated that Sarai was to be the mother of Abram's child; and hence her recourse to what was a prevalent practice of the times, while unjustifiable in itself, was a signal proof of her humility, of her devotion to her husband, and perhaps also of her faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</span> "The faith of both was defective; not indeed with regard to the substance of the premise, but with regard to the method in which they proceeded" (Calvin).

The act of Sarai (cf. the similar behavior of Stratonice, the wife of King Deiotarus, who, according to Plutarch, gave her maid Electra to her husband, and so obtained an heir to the crown) is as little to be imitated as the conduct of Abram. The apparent repetitions in Vers. 1-3 do not require the hypothesis of different authorship (Tuch, Colenso, Bleek, Davidson) for their explanation, but are characteristic of the genius of Hebrew composition (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1-10</a>), and may even be considerably removed by connecting Vers. 1, 2 with <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, and commencing the new sub-section with <a href="../../par/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a> (Quarry, p. 331).

THE ORIGIN OF CIRCUMCISION. The determination of this question does not appear of paramount importance, yet the ascertained results may be briefly indicated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> According to Herodotus (2. 104) circumcision was observed as a custom of primitive antiquity among the Colchiaus, Ethiopians, and Egyptians, by the last of whom it was communicated to the Syrians of Palestine and the Phoenicians. It is, however, uncertain Whether among the Egyptians the practice was universal, as Philo and Herodotus assert, or limited to the priesthood, as Origen believed; and equally doubtful whether the Egyptians themselves may not have adopted it from the Hebrews in the time of Joseph, instead of from the Ethiopians, as appears to be the judgment of Kalisch. Against the idea that circumcision was a national and universal observance among the Egyptians in the time of Abraham, it has been urged that the male servants of the patriarch, some of whom were Egyptians (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>), were not circumcised till Abraham was commanded to perform the rite; that Ishmael, the son of an Egyptian mother, remained uncircumcised till the same time; and that the daughter of Pharaoh recognized Moses as a Hebrew child, which, it is supposed, she could not have done had circumcision been generally practiced among her own people. On the other hand, it is contended that the absence of details as to how the rite should be performed seems to imply that already circumcision was familiar to Abraham; and by some modern Egyptologists it is asserted that an examination of ancient mummies and sculptures, in which circumcision is a distinctive mark between the Egyptians and their enemies, shows that the ceremony must have been in use not among the priests only, but throughout the nation generally so early as the time of the fourth dynasty, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> , or considerably earlier than the time of Abraham. Still <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> though it should be held as indubitably established that circumcision was a prevalent custom among the Egyptians in the time of Abraham, it would not follow that the Hebrews adopted it from them. On the contrary, the Biblical narrative expressly mentions that its observance by the patriarch and- his household was due to a Divine command, and was connected with a religious significance which was altogether foreign to the Egyptians and others by whom that rite was practiced. Among the reasons for its adoption by the heathen nations of antiquity have been assigned, among the Ethiopians, a prophylactic design to ward off certain painful, and often incurable, disorders; among the Egyptians, a regard to cleanliness; and perhaps among the priesthood of the latter country a semi-religious idea (the deification of the generative powers) was associated with a practice which was commonly regarded as enhancing productivity; but the import of the ceremony as enjoined upon the father of the faithful was as widely as possible removed from every one of these ideas, being connected with spiritual conceptions of which the heathen world was entirely ignorant. That a heathen custom should have been adopted by Jehovah and elevated to the rank and connected with the spiritual significance of a religious sign will not occur as a difficulty to those who remember that the rainbow, a well-known natural phenomenon, was selected as the sign for Noah's covenant, and that Christian baptism is a similar transformation of a previously existing ceremony by which Gentile proselytes were admitted to the Hebrew Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

That these three men were not manifestations of the three persons of the Godhead (Justin Martyr, Ambrose, Cyril), but Jehovah accompanied by two created angels (Keil, <span class="accented">et alii</span>, may be inferred from <a href="../../par/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>.

The expression denotes the complete prostration of the body by first falling on the knees, and then inclining the head forwards till it touches the ground. As this was a mode of salutation practiced by Orientals towards superiors generally, such as kings and princes (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>), but also towards equals (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-6.htm">Genesis 33:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-26.htm">Genesis 43:26</a>), as well as towards the Deity (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), it is impossible to affirm with certainty (Keil, Lunge) that an act of worship was intended by the patriarch, and not simply the presentation of human and civil honor (Calvin). If <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> inclines to countenance the latter interpretation, the language in which Abraham immediately addresses one of the three men almost leads to the conclusion that already the patriarch had recognized Jehovah.

"<span class="accented">Whenever</span> our path led us near an encampment, as was frequently the case, we always found some active sheikh or venerable patriarch sitting 'in his tent door,' and as soon as we were within haft we heard the earnest words of welcome and invitation which the Old Testament Scriptures had rendered long ago familiar to us: Stay, my lord, stay.

It does not, however, follow that the Divine righteousness would have been compromised by consigning pious and wicked to the same temporal destruction. This must have been a spectacle not infrequently observed in Abraham's day as well as ours. Yet the mind of Abraham appears to have been perplexed, as men's minds often are still, by the magnitude of the proposed illustration of a common principle in Providence. Though prepared to admit the principle when its application is confined to solitary cases, or cases of no great amplitude, yet instinctively the human mind feels that there must be a limit to the commingling of the righteous and the wicked in calamity, though it should be only of a temporal description. That limit Abraham conceived, or perhaps feared that others might conceive, would be passed if good and bad in Sodom should be overwhelmed in a common ruin; and in this spirit the closing utterance of his first supplication may be regarded as giving expression to the hope that Jehovah would do nothing that would even seem to tarnish his Divine righteousness. Abraham of course regarded this as impossible, consequently he believed that Sodom might be spared.

Corresponding to the ancient forum of the Romans, or agora of the Greeks, the city gate among the Hebrews was the customary place of resort for the settlement of disputes, the transaction of business, or the enjoyment of ordinary social intercourse (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). It was probably an arch with deep recesses, in which were placed chairs for the judges or city magistrates, and seats or benches for the citizens who had business to transact. So Homer describes the Trojan elders as sitting at the Scaean gate (3. 148). In what capacity Lot was sitting in the gate is not narrated. That he was on the outlook for travelers on whom to practice the hospitality he had learned from his uncle (Peele, Calvin, Willet, Lange) is perhaps to form too high an ideal of his piety (Kalisch); while the explanation that he had been pro-meted to the dignity of one of the city judges, though not perhaps justified as an inference from Ver. 9, is not at all unlikely, considering his relationship to Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">And Lot seeing them</span> (and recognizing them to be strangers by their dress and looks) <span class="cmt_word">rose up to meet them</span>; - having not yet abandoned the practice of hospitality, or forgotten, through mingling with the Sodomites, the respectful courtesy which was due to strangers, since the writer adds - <span class="cmt_word">and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>).

Hence, as a fragment of the original Elohist's composition, the present verse is by the pseudo-criticism connected with <a href="../../par/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a> (Ilgen, Tuch, Block); but "a greater abruptness of style and a more fragmentary mode of composition" than this would indicate "could not easily be imagined" (Kalisch). The change in the Divine name is sufficiently explained by the supposition that the destruction of the cities of the plain was not at the moment viewed by the writer in its connection with the Abrahamic covenant and intercession, but as a sublime vindication of Divine justice (cf.

The obvious allusions to them in the present verse could only have been made by one acquainted with them. Either, therefore, the present verse proceeded from the hand of the so-called Jehovist, or it requires explanation how in the original document this should be the first and only occasion on which they are referred to (cf.

Their proposal was revolting and unnatural in the extreme. By subsequent Mosaic legislation a transgression of such enormity was rendered punishable by death. Even in the present instance the perpetrators were not wholly unconscious of the wickedness of their conduct. The fact that they required a stratagem for the attainment of their purpose shows that at least they could not calculate on their father's approbation. The entire story has been regarded as the invention of later Jewish hatred to the Moabites and Ammonites (De Wette), a conjecture believed by some to be " not improbable (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but if so, how should the same writer exhibit Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) as filled with compassionate tenderness towards the cities of the plain?

The reading, "when <span class="accented">he</span> lay down and when he arose (LXX.) is incorrect, and the explanations that Lot was a mere unconscious instrument in this disgraceful transaction (Kalisch), that he was-entirely ignorant of all that had taken place (Chrysostom, Cajetan), that he was struck on account of his intemperance with a spirit of stupor (Calvin), are not warranted by the text.

Its plural form is to be explained neither as a remnant of polytheism (Gesenius), nor as indicating a plurality of beings through whom the Deity reveals himself (Baumgarten, Lange), nor as a plural of majesty (Aben Ezra, Kalisch, Alford), like the royal "we" of earthly potentates, a usage which the best Hebraists affirm to have no existence in the Scriptures (Macdonald), nor as a cumulative plural, answering the same purpose as a repetition of the Divine name (Hengstenberg, Dreschler, and others); but either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a <span class="accented">pluralis intensitatis</span>, expressive of the fullness of the Divine nature, and the multiplicity of the Divine powers (Delitzsch, Murphy, Macdonald); or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> notwithstanding Calvin s dread of Sabellianism, as a <span class="accented">pluralis trinitatis</span>, intended to foreshadow the threefold personality of the Godhead (Luther, Cocceius, Peter Lombard, Murphy, Candlish, &c.); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> both. The suggestion of Tayler Lewis, that the term may be a contraction for El-Elohim, the God of all superhuman powers, is inconsistent with neither of the above interpretations That the Divine name should adjust itself without difficulty to all subsequent discoveries of the fullness of the Divine personality and nature is only what we should expect in a God-given revelation. Unless where it refers to the angels (<a href="../../par/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>), or to heathen deities (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-32.htm">Genesis 31:32</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-20.htm">Jeremiah 16:20</a>), or to earthly rulers (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8, 9</a>), <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is conjoined with verbs and adjectives in the singular, an anomaly in language which has been explained as suggesting the unity of the Godhead. <span class="cmt_word">Created</span>. <span class="accented">Bara</span>, one of three terms employed in this section, and in Scripture generally, to describe the Divine activity; the other two being <span class="accented">yatzar</span>, "formed," and <span class="accented">asah</span>, "made" - both signifying to construct out of pre-existing materials (cf. for <span class="accented">yatzar</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/8-19.htm">Genesis 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-15.htm">Psalm 33:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; for <span class="accented">asah</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/5-16.htm">Exodus 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>), and predicable equally of God and man. <span class="accented">Barn</span> is used exclusively of God. Though not necessarily involved in its significance, the idea of creation <span class="accented">ex nihilo is</span> acknowledged by the best expositors to be here intended. Its employment in vers. 21, 26, though seem ugly against, is really in favor of a distinctively creative act; in both of these instances something that did not previously exist, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> animal life and the human spirit, having been called into being. In the sense of producing what is new it frequently occurs in Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-18.htm">Isaiah 65:18</a>). Thus, according to the teaching of this venerable document, the visible universe neither existed from eternity, nor was fashioned out of pre-existing materials, nor proceeded forth as an emanation from the Absolute, but was summoned into being by an express creative fiat. The New Testament boldly claims this as a doctrine peculiar to revelation (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>). Modern science explicitly disavows it as a discovery of reason. The continuity of force admits of neither creation nor annihilation, but demands an unseen universe, out of which the visible has been produced "by an intelligent agency residing in the unseen," and into which it must eventually return ('The Unseen Universe,' pp. 167, 170). Whether the language of the writer to the Hebrews homologates the dogma of an "unseen universe" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), out of which <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the last result of science, as expressed by the authors of the above-named work, is practically an admission of the Biblical doctrine of creation. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens and the earth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">mundus universus</span> - Gesenius, Kalisch, &c. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>. The earth and the heavens always mean the terrestrial globe with its aerial firmament. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-13.htm">Psalm 148:13</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/5-9.htm">Zechariah 5:9</a>). The earth here alluded to is manifestly not the dry land (ver. 10), which was not separated from the waters till the third day, but the entire mass of which our planet is composed, including the superincumbent atmosphere, which was not uplifted from the chaotic deep until the second day. The heavens are the rest of the universe. The Hebrews were aware of other heavens than the "firmament" or gaseous expanse which over-arches the earth. "Tres regiones," says Poole, "ubi ayes, ubi nubes, ubi sidera." But, beyond these, the Shemitie mind conceived of the heaven where the angels dwell (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>), and where God specially resides (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>), if, indeed, this latter was not distinguished as a more exalted region than that occupied by any creature - as "the heaven of heavens," the pre-eminently sacred abode of the Supreme (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a>). The fundamental idea associated with the term was that of height (<span class="accented">shamayim</span>, literally, "the heights" - Gesenius, Furst). To the Greek mind heaven meant "the boundary" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - Arist.), or, "the raised up" (from <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;</span> - to be prominent - Liddell and Scott). The Latin spoke of "the con cavity" (<span class="accented">coelum</span>, allied to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, hollow), or "the engraved" (from <span class="accented">coelo</span>, to engrave). The Saxon thought of "<span class="accented">the</span> heaved-up arch." The Hebrew imagined great spaces rising tier upon tier above the earth (which, m contradistinction, was named "the flats"), just as with regard to time he spoke of <span class="accented">olamim</span> (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). Though not anticipating modern astronomical discovery, he had yet enlarged conceptions of the dimensions of the stellar world (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>); and, though unacquainted with our present geographical ideas of the earth's configuration, he was able to represent it as a globe, and as suspended upon nothing (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7-10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>). The connection of the present verse with those which follow has been much debated. The proposal of Aben Ezra, adopted by Calvin, to read, "In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was" is grammatically inadmissible. Equally objectionable on the ground of grammar is the suggestion of Bunsen and Ewald, to connect the first verse with the third, and make the second parenthetical; while it is opposed to that simplicity of construction which pervades the chapter. The device of Drs. Buckland and Chalmers, so favorably regarded by some harmonists of Scripture and geology, to read the first verse as a heading to the whole section, is exploded by the fact that no historical narration can begin with "and." To this <a href="../../par/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a>. It is no exception, the second book of Moses being in reality a continuation of the first. Honest exegesis requires that ver. I shall be viewed as descriptive of the first of the series of Divine acts detailed in the chapter, and that ver. 2, while admitting of an interval, shall be held as coming in immediate succession - an interpretation, it may be said, which is fatal to the theory which discovers the geologic ages between the creative beginning and primeval chaos. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <i>was</i> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the earth</span>. Clearly the earth referred to in the preceding verse, the present terrestrial globe with its atmospheric firmament, and not simply "the land" as opposed to "the skies" (Murphy); certainly not "the heavens" of ver. 1 as well as the earth (Delitzsch); and least of all "a section of the dry land in Central Asia" (Buckland, Pye Smith). It is a sound principle of exegesis that a word shall retain the meaning it at first possesses till either intimation is made by the writer of a change in its significance, or such change is imperatively demanded by the necessities of the context, neither of which is the case here. <span class="cmt_word">Was.</span> Not "had become." <span class="cmt_word">Without form and void</span>. Literally, wasteness and emptiness, <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span>. The words are employed in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a> to depict the desolation and desertion of a ruined and depopulated land, and by many have been pressed into service to support the idea of a preceding cosmos, of which the chaotic condition of our planet was the wreck (Murphy, Wordsworth, Bush, &c). Delitzsch argues, on the ground that <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span> implies the ruin of a previous cosmos, that ver. 2 does not state specifically that God created the earth in this desolate and waste condition; and that death, which is inconceivable out of connection with sin, was in the world prior to the fall; that ver. 2 presupposes the fall of the angels, and adduces in support of his view <a href="../../par/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-7</a> ('Bib. Psychology,' sect. 1, p. 76; Clark's 'For. Theol. Lib.') - a notion which Kalisch contemptuously classes among "the aberrations of profound minds," and "the endless reveries" of "far-sighted thinkers." Bush is confident that <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>, in which Jehovah declares that he created not the earth <span class="accented">roan</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> conclusive against a primeval chaos. The parallel clause, however, shows that not the original state, but the ultimate design of the globe, was contemplated in Jehovah's language: "<span class="accented">He</span> created it not <span class="accented">tohu</span>, he formed it to be inhabited;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Creator did not intend the earth to be a desolate region, but an inhabited planet. There can scarcely be a doubt, then, that the expression portrays the condition in which the new-created earth was, not innumerable ages, but very shortly, after it was summoned into existence. It was formless and lifeless; a huge, shapeless, objectless, tenantless mass of matter, the gaseous and solid elements commingled, in which neither organized structure, nor animated form, nor even distinctly-traced outline of any kind appeared. <span class="cmt_word">And darkness</span> (was) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the deep.</span> The "deep," from a root signifying to disturb, is frequently applied to the sea (<a href="../../par/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>), and here probably intimates that the primordial matter of our globe existed in a fluid, or liquid, or molten form. Dawson distinguishes between "the deep" and the "waters," making the latter refer to the liquid condition of the globe, and the former apply to "the atmospheric waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vaporous or aeriform mass mantling the surface of our nascent planet, and containing the materials out of which the atmosphere was afterwards elaborated ('Origin of the World,' p. 105). As yet the whole was shrouded in the thick folds of Cimmerian gloom, giving not the slightest promise of that fair world of light, order, and life into which it was about to be transformed. Only one spark of hope might have been detected in the circumstance that <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of God moved</span> (literally, brooding) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the waters</span>. That the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span>, or breath of God, was not "a great wind," or "a wind of God," is determined by the non-existence of the air at this particular stage in the earth's development. In accordance with Biblical usage generally, it must be regarded as a designation not simply "of the Divine power, which, like the wind and the breath, cannot be perceived" (Gesenius), but of the Holy Spirit, who is uniformly represented as the source or formative cause of all life and order in the world, whether physical, intellectual, or spiritual (cf. <a href="../../par/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>). As it were, the mention of the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span> is the first out-blossoming of the latent fullness of the Divine personality, the initial movement in that sublime revelation of the nature of the Godhead, which, advancing slowly, and at the best but indistinctly, throughout Old Testament times, culminated in the clear and ample disclosures of the gospel The special form of this Divine agent's activity is described as that of" brooding" (<span class="accented">merachepheth</span>, from <span class="accented">raehaph</span>, <span class="accented">to be</span> tremulous, as with love; hence, in Piel, to cherish young - <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>) or fluttering over the liquid elements of the shapeless and tenantless globe, communicating to them, doubtless, those formative powers of life and order which were to burst forth into operation in answer to the six words of the six ensuing days. As might have been anticipated, traces of this primeval chaos are to be detected in various heathen cosmogonies, as the following brief extracts will show: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">Chaldean</span> legend, deciphered from the creation tablet discovered in the palace of Assurbanipal, King of Assyria, 2. c. 885, depicts the desolate and void condition of the earth thus: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When above were not raised the heavens,<br />And below on the earth a plant had not grown up;<br />The abyss also had not broken up their boundaries;</span> The chaos (or water) tiamat (the sea) was the producing-mother of the whole of them," &c. ('Chaldean Genesis,' p. 62.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">The Babylonian</span> cosmogony, according to Berosus (B.C. 330-260), commences with a time "in which there existed nothing but darkness" and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were produced of a twofold principle... The person who presided over them was a woman named Omoroea, which in the Chaldean language is Thalatth, in Greek Thalassa, the sea, but which might equally be interpreted the moon" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 40, 41). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The <span class="accented">Egyptian</span> account of the origin of the universe, as given by Diodorus Siculus, represents the heaven and earth as blended together, till afterwards the elements began to separate and the air to move. According to another idea, there was a vast abyss enveloped in boundless darkness, with a subtle spirit, intellectual in power, existing in the chaos (Macdonald, 'Creation and the Fall,' p. 49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The <span class="accented">Phoenician</span> cosmogony says, "The first principle of the universe was a dark windy air and an eternal dark chaos. Through the love of the Spirit to its own principles a mixture arose, and a connection called desire, the beginning of all things. From this connection of the Spirit was begotten mot, which, according to some, signifies mud, according to others, a corruption of a watery mixture, but is probably a feminine form of <span class="accented">too</span>, water. From this were developed creatures in the shape of an egg, called zophasemin (Macdonald, p. 50). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> <span class="accented">The Indian</span> mythology is very striking in its resemblance to the Mosaic narrative." The institutes of Menu affirm' that at first all was dark, the world still resting in the purpose of the Eternal, whose first thought created water, and in it the seed of life. This became an egg, from which issued Brahma, the creative power, who divided his own substance and became male and female. The waters were called <span class="accented">nara</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being the production of Nara, or the Spirit of God, who, on account of these being his first <span class="accented">ayana</span>, or place of motion, is named Naray-na, or moving on the <span class="accented">waters</span>. A remarkable hymn from the Rig Veda, translated by Dr. Max Muller, also closely approximates to the Scriptural account: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nor aught nor naught existed; yon bright sky<br />Was not, nor heaven's broad woof out-stretched above.<br />The only one breathed breathless by itself;<br />Other than it there nothing since hath been.<br />Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<br />In gloom profound - an ocean without light."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Vid. Macdonald's 'Creation,' &c., p. 51.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The description of chaos given by Ovid is too appropriate to be overlooked: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Ante mare et tellus, et, quod tegit omnia, caelum,<br />Unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe,<br />Quem dixere chaos; rudis indigestaque moles quia corpere in uno<br />Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,<br />Mollia cum duris, sine Pendere habentia pondus"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Metamor.,' lib, 1:1</span>). Yet not more remarkable are these indirect confirmations of the truthfulness of the Biblical cosmogony than the direct corroborations it derives from the discoveries of modern science. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The <span class="accented">nebular hypothesis</span> of Laplace, which, though only a hypothesis, must vet be admitted to possess a high degree of probability, strikingly attests its authenticity. That eminent astronomer demonstrated that a huge chaotic mass of nebulous matter, revolving in space on its own axis with a sufficient velocity, and gradually condensing from a high degree of heat, would eventually, by throwing off successive rings from the parent body, develop all the celestial orbs that presently compose our planetary system. Though for a long time regarded with suspicion by Biblical scholars, and at the first only tentatively thrown out by its author, Kant, yet so exactly does it account for the phenomena of our solar system as disclosed by the telescope, that it may now be said to have vindicated its claim to be accepted as the best solution science has to give of the formation of the universe; while further and more dispassionate reflection has convinced theologians generally, that so far from conflicting with the utterances of inspiration, it rather surprisingly endorses them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The researches of <span class="accented">physical philosophy in</span> connection with hydrodynamics have successfully established that the present form of our earth, that of (the solid of revolution called) an oblate spheroid, is such as it must necessarily have assumed had its original condition been that of a liquid mass revolving round its own axis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Geological science</span> likewise contributes its quota to the constantly accumulating weight of evidence in support of the Mosaic narrative, by announcing, as the result of its investigations in connection with the earth's crust, that below a certain point, called "the stratum of invariable temperature," the heat of the interior mass becomes greater in proportion to the depth beneath the surface, thus leading not unnaturally to the inference that "the earth has assumed its present state by cooling down from an intensely heated, or gaseous, or fluid state" (Green's 'Geology,' p. 487.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - The evolution of the cosmos was accomplished by a series of Divine formative works which extended over a period of six successive days. In the character of those cosmic labors a progression is distinctly visible, though not continuous throughout Unless, with Aristotle, the celestial luminaries are regarded as <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>, and so classed in the category of organized and living beings, it is impossible to find in their production an advance upon the preceding vegetation. Arbitrary transpositions of the days, as of the third and fourth, in order to make the first half of the creative week an inorganic, and the second half an organic, era, are inadmissible. The arrangement of the days that accords most exactly with the requirements of the case, and most successfully preserves the order and connection of the record, is that which divides them into two triads (Lange, Kalisch, Dana, &c.), as exhibited underneath: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Air, Water. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Dry Land and Plants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Lights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Fowl, Fish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Animals and Man  = - each triad Beginning with the Making of Light, and ending with a double creation, and the works performed On the Second having each a definite Relation to the labors executed On the First On the First creative Day the formative energy of the Divine Word, eliminates the light from the dark chaotic mass of earth, on the second uplifts the atmosphere above the waters, and on the third distinguishes the dry land from the sea - at a later period in this same day clothing the dry land with vegetation, as if to prophesy some correspondingly higher advance in the creation work at the close of the second series. At this stage, instead of pressing forward with its operations, the demiurgic potency of the invisible Artificer appears to pause, and, reverting to the point from which it started, enters on its second course of labors. On the fourth day the light developed on the first is concentrated and permanently fixed in the celestial luminaries; on the fifth the air and waters, which were separated on the second, are filled with fowl and fish, their respective inhabitants; and on the sixth the dry land of the third day is occupied by animals, the mute prediction of the third day's vegetation being fulfilled by the creation of man. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Day one</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And God said</span>. This phrase, which is ten times repeated in the narrative of the six days' work, is commonly regarded as an instance of anthropomorphism, a peculiarity of revelation, and of this chapter in particular, at which rationalism affects to be offended. But any other mode of representing the Deity would have failed to convey to finite minds an intelligent idea of his nature. "<span class="accented">Touching</span> the Almighty, who can find him out?" The most that God himself could do in communicating to his creature man a conception of his ineffable and unapproachable Godhead was to supply him with an anthropomorphic image of himself - "the Word made flesh." Deeper insight, however, into this sublime statement discerns that "anthropomorphism" does not exhaust its significance. God spoke; but to whom? "This was an omnipotent word," says Luther, "spoken in the Divine essence. No one heard this word uttered but God himself... The Father spoke within." It is observable too that every time the word goes forth from Elohim it is followed by instantaneous movement in the chaos, as if the word itself were inherently creative. Remembering, then, that the doctrine of a personal Logos was not unknown to the later theology of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-5.htm">Psalm 148:5</a>), and is clearly revealed in the New (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>), it is difficult to resist the inference that here we have its roots, and that a correct exegesis should find in the creative word of Elohim an adumbration of the <span class="accented">Devar Jehovah</span> of the Hebrew Psalter, the <span class="accented">Logos</span> of John's Gospel, and the Rema <span class="accented">Theou</span> of the writer to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Let there be light: and there was light.</span> The sublimity of these words, which arrested the attention of the heathen Longinus ('De Sublimitate,' 9.), and which Milton ('Paradise Lost,' 7.) and Du Bartas, an elder poet (viz. Kitto <span class="accented">in loco</span>), have tried to reproduce, is in great measure lost in our English version. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.) and <span class="accented">sit lux et fuit lux</span> (Vulg.) are superior translations of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> which might be rendered, "<span class="accented">Light</span> be, and light was."' With reference to their import, the least satisfactory explanation, notwithstanding the eminent names that have lent it their support (Bush, Kitto, Murphy, Wordsworth), is that which understands the sun to have been created a perfectly finished luminous body from the first, though hitherto its light had been intercepted by the earth's vapors, which were now dispersed by Divine command. But the language of Elohim is too exalted to be applied to so familiar a phenomenon as the dissipation of terrestrial mists, and, besides, expressly negatives the hypothesis in question by affirming that the light was summoned into <span class="accented">being</span>, and not simply into <span class="accented">appearance</span>. The historian, too, explicitly asserts that the light was, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> began to be, and not merely to be visible. A modification of this view, viz., that the sun and moon were now created, but did not become visible until the fourth day (Inglis), must likewise be rejected, as according neither with ver. 1, which says that the heavenly bodies were created in the beginning, nor with vers. 16, 17, which declare that not until the fourth day were they constituted sources of light for the earth. The exigencies of the text, as well as the ascertained facts of physical science, require the first day's work to be the original production of light throughout the universe, and in particular throughout our planetary system (Kalisch, Lange, Delitzsch, Dawson). Calvin, though much more deeply concerned about the refutation of Servetus, who maintained that the Word only began to be with the creation of light, was able to perceive that this light was independent of the sun and moon; in this agreeing with Augustine, who, however, conjectured it to be not material, but spiritual in its nature ('De Genesi ad Literam,' lib. 1, 100. 3). Nor does it in the slightest conflict with ver. 1 to suppose that light was now for the first time produced, light being a <span class="accented">mode</span> or <span class="accented">condition</span> of matter, and not a distinct <span class="accented">element</span> or <span class="accented">substance</span>, as was at one time believed. Luminosity is simply the result of incandescence, although what specific change is effected on the constitutions or adjustments of the molecules of a body by the process of heating which renders it luminous science is unable to explain. Any solid body can be rendered incandescent by being heated up to between 700&deg; and 800&deg; Fahrenheit. Any liquid that can absorb as great a quantity of heat likewise emits light. Gases do not appear to be capable of incandescence, though the phenomena attending their sudden condensation discover light-producing properties in their composition. As to how the light of incandescent bodies is transmitted to the eye, the Pythagorean and Newtonian theory of small, impalpable particles of luminous matter being constantly emitted from their surfaces towards the eye may be said to have been successfully displaced by that of Descartes, Huygens, and Euler, which accounts for the phenomena of vision by the existence throughout space, and in the interstitial spaces of bodies, of an infinitely attenuated <span class="accented">ether</span>, which is thrown into undulations by luminous bodies precisely as the atmosphere is made to vibrate by bodies which are sonorous. But whichever theory be adopted to solve the mystery of its transmission, that of <span class="accented">emanation</span> or of <span class="accented">undulation</span>, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the creation of light, which formed the opus <span class="accented">operatum</span> of the first day, was in reality the evolution from the dark-robed, seething mass of our condensing planet (and probably from the other bodies in our solar system) of that luminous matter which supplies the light. It seems unnecessary to add that it could not have been either the subterranean fire which produced the igneous rocks of geology (Tayler) or caloric (Clarke); though, as <span class="accented">aor</span> is used in Scripture for heat (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>), fire (<a href="../../par/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>), the sun (<a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>), lightning (<a href="../../par/job/37-3.htm">Job 37:3</a>), and there is every reason to believe that light, heat, and electricity are only modifications of the same force, we may be warranted in embracing all the three in its significance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And God saw the light, that <i>it was</i> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God saw the light, that it was good</span>. The anthropomorphism of this verse is suggestive, as teaching that from the first the absolute and all-sufficient Elohim was an intelligent Spectator of the operation of his own laws and forces, and was profoundly interested in the results which they achieved - an amount and degree of interference with the vast machine of nature which would satisfy any rational theist of today. God <span class="accented">saw</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> examined and judged the newly-finished product, investigated its nature and its properties, contemplated its uses, admired its excellences, noted its correspondence with his own Divine idea; and in all these respects he pronounced it good. Afterwards it is the particular arrangement effected, or condition induced, by the creative word that evokes the Divine commendation; here it is the creature itself - "perhaps as the one object in nature which forms the fittest representation of the Creator himself, who is Light, and in whom is no darkness at all (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), and of the true Light, which lighteth every man (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>)" (Macdonald). <span class="cmt_word">And God divided between the light and the darkness</span>. The celestial, bodies not having been constituted light-holders for the earth until the fourth day forbids the supposition that the luminous matter, on being eliminated from the chaotic mass, was forthwith transported towards and concentrated in the sun. The sun itself, it is now well known, is "a solid mass of highly igneous matter engirt by a bed of dense clouds, on the top of which there lies, encircling all, a floating phosphorescent or luminous atmosphere, the lower part of it splendid, but the upper of luster altogether dazzling, from which streams the flood of light that enlivens all surrounding spheres" (Nichol's 'Cyclopedia,' art. Sun). "If, therefore, with Laplace, we may assume that the physical history of the sun was the archetype of that of the various planetary bodies that compose our system, we must think of them also, in the process of condensation, developing luminous atmospheres, which would continue encircling them, and in fact making them suns, until, through their further condensation, those phosphorescent bands were broken up, and, becoming disengaged from their parent globes, were attracted towards, and subsequently centralized in, the photosphere of the sun. So far as our earth is concerned, that happened on the fourth day. On the first day the light would either ensphere it in a radiant cloud, or exist apart from it, like a sun, though always in the plane of its orbit" (Delitzsch). If the former, then manifestly, though revolving on its axis, the earth would not experience the vicissitude of day and night, which some conjecture was not at this time established; if the latter, then the same succession of light and darkness would be begun as was afterwards rendered permanent by the fourth day's work. The chief reasons for the latter alternative are the supposed necessity of understanding the term day as a period of twenty-four hours, and the apparent impossibility of explaining how the light could be divided from the darkness otherwise than by the diurnal revolution of the earth. The Hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, however, means to disjoin what was previously mixed, and may simply refer to the separation of the luminous particles from the opaque mass. By that very act the light was divided from the darkness. It was henceforth to be no more commingled. "The light denotes all that is simply illuminating in its efficacy, all the luminous element; the darkness denotes all that is untransparent, dark, shadow-casting; both together denote the polarity of the created world as it exists between the light-formations and the night-formations - the constitution of the day and night" (Lange). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God called</span> (literally, called to) <span class="cmt_word">the light Day, and</span> (literally, to) <span class="cmt_word">the darkness he called Night</span>. "None but superficial thinkers," says Delitzsch, "<span class="accented">can</span> take offence at the idea of created things receiving names from God. The name of a thing is the expression of its nature. If the name be given by man, it fixes in a word the impression which it makes upon the human mind; but, when given by God, it expresses the reality, what the thing is in God's creation, and the place assigned it there by the side of other things." The things named were the light and the darkness; not the durations, but the phenomena. The names called were day, <span class="accented">yore</span>, and night, <span class="accented">layela</span>, which, again, were not time-measures, but character-descriptions. Ainsworth suggests that yore was intended to express "the tumult, stir, and business of the day," in all probability connecting it with <span class="accented">yam</span>, which depicts the foaming or the boiling of the sea; and that <span class="accented">layela</span>, in which he seems to detect the Latin <span class="accented">ululare</span>, is indicative of "<span class="accented">the</span> yelling or the howling of wild beasts at night." Gesenius derives the former from the unused root <span class="accented">yore</span>, which signifies to glow with heat, while the latter he associates with <span class="accented">lul</span>, also unused, to roll up, the idea being that the night wraps all things in obscurity. Macdonald sees in the naming of the creatures an expression of sovereignty and lordship, as when Adam named the beasts of the field. <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the first day.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">And evening was</span> and <span class="accented">morning was</span>, <span class="accented">day one</span>. Considerable diversity of sentiment prevails with regard to the exact interpretation of these words. On the one hand, it is assumed that the first creative period is here described as an ordinary astronomical or sidereal day of twenty-four hours' duration, its constituent parts being characterized in the usual way, as an evening and a morning. In the judgment of Kalisch and others the peculiar phrase, "Evening was, and morning was," is simply equivalent to the later Hebrew compound "evening-morning" (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>), and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), both of which denote a natural or civil day, though this is challenged, in the case of the Hebrew compound, by Macdonald. The language of the fourth commandment (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>) is also appealed to as removing, it beyond the sphere of doubt that the evening and the morning referred to are-the component sections of an earthly day. As to the proper <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> of this initial day, however, the advocates of this interpretation are at variance among themselves; Delitzsch taking the terms <span class="accented">ereb</span> (literally, "the setting," from <span class="accented">arab</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mix; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to set, to depart, like the sun) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="accented">boker</span> (literally, "<span class="accented">the</span> breaking forth," from <span class="accented">bakar</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> cleave, to open) in an active sense, and applying the former to the first fading of the light, and the latter to the breaking of the dawn after the first interval of darkness has passed, thus reckoning the creative days from daybreak to daybreak; while Murphy and Kalisch, who agree with him in regarding the days as ordinary solar days, declare they must be reckoned, <span class="accented">Hebraico</span> more, from sunset to sunset. But if the first day commenced with an evening or obscure period (Has <span class="accented">ereb</span> no connection with <span class="accented">arab</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> mix? May it not describe the condition of things when light and darkness were commingled?), that can be discovered only in the chaotic <span class="accented">darkness</span> out of which the light sprang. Hence, on the other hand, as it seems improbable that this was of no more than twelve hours' duration, and as the presumption is that the light-period would be commensurate in length, it has been argued that day one was not a sun-measured day, but a period of indefinite extent. Of course the length of day one practically determines the length of all the six. If it was a solar day, then they must be considered such. But as the present sidereal arrangements for the measurement of time were not then established, it is clearly gratuitous to proceed on the assumption that it was Hence, neither is it to be accepted without-demonstration that they were not likewise periods of prolonged duration. It is obvious they were if it was; and that it was appears to be suggested by the terms in which it is described. This conclusion, that the creation days were long periods, and not simply solar days, is confirmed by a variety of considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> In the creation record itself (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) the term is employed with an obvious latitude of meaning; standing for <span class="accented">light as</span> opposed to darkness (ver. 5); day as distinguished from night; and for a period of <span class="accented">twenty-four hours</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the phrase "for days and years" (ver. 14); and again for the whole creation period of six days, or, as is more probable, for the second and third days (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> General Scripture usage sanctions this interpretation of the word day as a period of indefinite duration; g. g. <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-6.htm">Zechariah 14:6, 7</a>, which speaks of the time of our Lord s coming, and-indeed of the entire gospel dispensation, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">unus dies</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a day together unique, the only day of its kind (Delitzsch); and characterizes it as one of God's days, "known to the Lord," as if to distinguish it from one of man's ordinary civil days (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The works ascribed to the different days can with difficulty be compressed within the limits of a solar day. Taking the third day, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., if the events assigned to it belong <span class="accented">exclusively to the</span> region of the supernatural, nothing need prevent the belief that twenty-four hours were sufficient for their accomplishment; but if the Divine modus <span class="accented">operandi</span> during the first half of the creative week was through "existing causes" (even vastly accelerated), as geology affirms that it was during the second half, and as we know that it has been ever since its termination, then a considerably larger space of time than twice twelve hours must have been consumed in their execution. And the same conclusion forces itself upon the judgment from a consideration of the works allotted to the sixth day, in which not only were the animals produced and Adam made, but the former, being collected in Eden, were passed in review before the latter to be named, after which he was cast into a sleep by Jehovah Elohim, a rib extracted from his side and fashioned into a woman, and the woman presented to <span class="accented">him as</span> a partner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The duration of the seventh day of necessity determines the length of the other six. Without anticipating the exposition of <a href="../../par/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-4</a> (<span class="accented">q</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.), it may be said that God's sabbatic rest is understood by the best interpreters of Scripture to have continued from creation's close until the present hour; so that consistency demands the previous six days to be considered as not of short, but of indefinite, duration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The language of the fourth commandment, when interpreted in accordance with the present theory, confirms the probability of its truth, If the six days in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> are simply natural days, then the seventh day, in which God is represented as having rested from his creative labors, must likewise be a natural or solar day; and if so, it is proper to observe what follows. It follows <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the events recorded in the first five verses of Genesis must be compressed into a single day of twenty-four hours, so that no gap will remain into which the short-day advocates may thrust the geologic ages, which is for them an imperative necessity; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the world is only 144 hours older than man, which is contrary to both science and revelation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the statement is incorrect that God finished all his work at the close of the sixth day; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that the fossiliferous remains which have been discovered in the earth's crust have either been deposited there since man's creation, or were created there at the first, both of which suppositions are untenable. But now, if, on the contrary, the language signifies that God labored in the fashioning of his cosmos through six successive periods of indefinite duration (olamim, aeons), and entered on the seventh day into a correspondingly long period of sabbatic rest, we can hold the opposite of every one of these conclusions, and find a convincing argument besides for the observance of the sabbath in the beautiful analogy which subsists between God s great week of olamim and man's little week of sun-measured days, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Geology declares that the earth must have been brought to its present condition through a series of labors extending over indefinitely long epochs; and, notwithstanding the confident assertion of Kalisch and others that it is hopeless to harmonize science and revelation, the correspondence between the contents of these geologic ages and those of the Mosaic days is so surprising as to induce the belief that the latter were, like the former, extended periods. First, according to geology, traveling backward, comes the Cainozoic era, with the remains of animals, but not of man next is the Mezozoic era, with the remains of fish and fowl, but not of animals; and underneath that is the Palaeozoic era, with its carboniferous formations, but still with traces of aquatic life at its beginning and its end. Now, whether the vegetation of the third day is to be sought for in the carboniferous formations of the Palaeozoic age (Hugh Miller), or, as is more probable, in the age which saw the formation of the metamorphic rocks (Dawson), the order disclosed is precisely that which the Mosaic narrative affirms was observed first plants, then fish and fowl, and finally animals and man; so that if the testimony of the rocks be admissible at all upon the subject, it is unmistakably in favor of the long-period day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The opinion of neither Jewish nor Christian antiquity was entirely on the side of the natural-day theory. Josephus and Philo lent their sanction to the other view. Origen perceived the difficulty of having a firs. t, second, and third day, each with an evening and a morning, without the sun, moon, and stars, and resolved it by saying that these celestial luminaries were appointed "<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> ('Com. in Genesin,' 1:16). Augustine similarly writes, "Qui dies cujusmodi sint, ant perdifficile nobis, ant etiam impossibile est cogitare, quanto magis dicere Illorum autem priores tres sine sole peracti sunt, qui quarto die factus refertur" ('De Civitate Dei,' lib. 11:6, 7). Bode likewise remarks, "Fortassis hic diet nomen totius temporis nomen est, et omnia volumina seculorum hoc vocabulo includit." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Heathen cosmogonies may also be appealed to as an indirect confirmation of the preceding evidence. Egyptian, Persian, Indian, and Etruscan legends represent the elaboration of the world as having been accomplished in a series of ages of prolonged duration. "God created in the first thousand years heaven and earth; in the second the vault of heaven; in the third the sea and the other waters of the earth; in the fourth the sun, moon, and stars; in the fifth the inhabitants of the air, of the water, and of the land; and in the sixth man," is the creation story of Etruria; and although in itself it has no validity, yet, as a traditional reflection of the Mosaic narrative it is not entirely destitute of weight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

This, of course, does not prevent us from believing that the elimination of those gases (twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen, with a small proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueous vapor) which compose our atmosphere was not effected by natural means; and how far it may have been assisted by the action of the light upon the condensing mass of the globe is a problem in the solution of which science may legitimately take an interest. <span class="cmt_word">And divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament</span>. The <span class="accented">upper</span> waters are not the material of the stars (Delitzsch, Wordsworth), although Jupiter is of the same density as water, and Saturn only half its density; but the waters floating about in the higher spaces of the air. The under waters are not the lower atmospheric vapors, but the oceanic and terrestrial waters. How the waters are collected in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, Scripture, no less than science, explains to be by means of evaporation (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a>). These latter passages suggest that the clouds are balanced, suspended, upheld by the buoyancy of the air in exact accordance with scientific principles. <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>. Six times these words occur in the creation record. Sublimely suggestive of the resistless energy of the Divine word, which speaks, and it is done, commands, and it standeth fast, they likewise remind us of the sweet submissiveness of the creature to the all-wise Creator's will, and, perhaps, are designed as well to intimate the fixed and permanent character of those arrangements to which they are attached.

"This," says Principal Dawson, "may be regarded as an intimation that no definite barrier separates our film of atmosphere from the boundless abyss of heaven without;" and how appropriate the designation "heights" is, as applied to the atmosphere, we are reminded by science, which informs us that, after rising to the height of forty-five miles above the earth, it becomes imperceptible, and loses itself in the universal ether with which it is surrounded. <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the second day.</span> For the literal rendering of this clause see on ver. 5, It is observable that in connection with the second day's work the usual formula, "And God saw that it was good," is omitted.

The conceit of the Rabbis, that an expression of the Divine approbation was omitted because on this day the angels fell, requires no refutation. Aben Ezra accounts for its omission by making the second day's work terminate with ver. 10. Lange asks, "Had the prophetic author some anticipation that the blue vault was merely an appearance, whilst the sarans of the Septuagint had no such anticipation, and therefore proceeded to doctor the passage?" The explanation of Calvin, Delitzsch, Macdonald, and Alford, though declared by Kalisch to be of no weight, is probably the correct one, that the work begun on the second day was not properly terminated till the middle of the third, at which place, accordingly, the expression of Divine approbation is introduced (see ver. 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry <i>land</i> appear: and it was so.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Day three</span>. The distribution of land and water and the production of vegetation on this day engaged the formative energy of the word of Elohim. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let the waters under heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear</span>. To explain the second part of this phenomenon as a consequence of the first, the disclosure of the solid ground by the retirement of the waters from its surface, and not rather <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, is to reverse the ordinary processes of nature. Modern analogy suggests that the breaking up of the hitherto universal ocean into seas, lakes, and rivers was effected by the upheaval of the land through the action of subterranean fires, or the subsidence of the earth's crust in consequence of the cooling and shrinking of the interior mass. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> hints at electric agency in connection with the elevation of the mountains and the sinking of the ocean beds. "<span class="accented">At</span> thy rebuke they (the waters) fled: at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away (were scattered). The mountains rose, the valleys sank (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x28;</span> LXX.; ascendunt montes, et descendunt campi - Jerome) to the place which thou hadst established for them" (Perowne). The gathering of the waters into one place implies no more than that they were, from this day forward, to be collected into one vast body, and restrained within bounds in a place by themselves, so as to admit of the exposure of the earth's soil. The "place founded for them" was, of course, the depths and hollows in the earth's crust, into which they were immediately withdrawn, not through direct supernatural agency, but by their own natural gravitation. The configuration of the dry land is not described; but there is reason to believe that the original distribution of land and water was the same, or nearly the same, as it is at present. Physical geographers have observed that the coast lines of the great continents and the mountain ranges generally run from north-east to south-west, and that these lines are in reality parts of great circles, tangent to the polar circle, and at right angles to a line drawn from the <span class="accented">sun's</span> center to the moon's, when these bodies are either in conjunction or in opposition. These circles, it has further been remarked, are "the lines on which the thin crust of a cooling globe would be most likely to be ruptured by its internal tidal wave." Hence, though considerably modified by the mighty revolutions through which at successive periods the earth has passed, "these, with certain subordinate lines of fracture, have determined the forms of continents from the beginning" (Dawson, 'O.W.,' p. 184; cf. 'Green's Geology,' p. 512). <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>. Though the separation of the dry land from the waters and the distribution of both were effected by Divine agency, nothing in the Mosaic narrative obliges us to think that these works were instantaneously completed. "There is truly no difficulty in supposing that the formation of the hills kept on through the succeeding creative days" (Lange). "Generally the works of the single creative days consist only in laying foundations; the birth process that is introduced in each extends its efficacy be, yond it" (Delitzsch). "Not <span class="accented">how long</span>, but <span class="accented">how many times</span>, God created is the thing intended to be set forth" by the creative days (Hoffman). Scripture habitually represents the world in an aspect at once natural and supernatural, speaking of it as <span class="accented">natura</span> and <span class="accented">creatura</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. Marten, sen's 'Dogmatics,' &sect; 63); and although the latter is the view exhibited with greatest prominence, indeed exclusively, in the Mosaic cosmogony, vet the frowner is not thereby denied, Not immediateness, but certainty of execution, is implied in the "it was so" appended to the creative fiat. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God called the dry land Earth</span>.

Gesenius). Originally applied to the dry ground as distinguished from the seas, as soon as it was understood that the solid earth was continuous beneath the water masses, by an easy extension of meaning it came to signify the whole surface of the globe. <span class="cmt_word">And the gathering together of the waters called he Seas.</span> <span class="accented">Yamim</span>, from <span class="accented">yom</span>, to boil or foam, is applied in Scripture to any large collection of water (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>).

The waters having been permanently withdrawn to the place founded for them by the upheaval of the great mountain ranges, and the elevation of the continental areas, the work thus accomplished is sealed by the Divine approval. The separation of the land and water was <span class="accented">good</span>, as a decided advance towards the completion of the <span class="accented">cosmos</span>, as the proper termination of the work commenced upon the previous day, as the production of two elements in themselves beautiful, and in separation useful as abodes of life, with which they were in due course to be replenished. "To our view," says Dawson, "that primeval dry land would scarcely have seemed good. It was a world of bare, rocky peaks and verdureless valleys - here active volcanoes, with their heaps of scoriae, and scarcely cooled lava currents - there vast mud-fiats, recently upheaved from the bottom of the waters - nowhere even a blade of grass or a clinging lichen. Yet it was good in the view of its Maker, who could see it in relation to the uses for which he had made it, and as a fit preparatory step to the new wonders he was soon to introduce. "Besides," <span class="accented">the</span> first dry land may have presented crags, and peaks, and ravines, and volcanic cones in a more marvelous and perfect manner than any succeeding continents, even as the dry and barren moon now, in this respect, far surpasses the earth" ('O.W.,' p. 181).

The phrase "<span class="accented">after</span> his kind, appended to the second and third, seems to indicate that the different species of plants were already fixed.

In all probability the seed forms were in the soil from the first, only waiting to be vitalized by the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim - The</span> Spirit of God; or they may have been then created. Certainly they were not evolved from the dead matter of the dry land. Scripture, no more than science, is acquainted with Abiogenesis. Believing that "if it were given to her to- look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time, she might "witness the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter," science yet honestly affirms "that she sees no reason for believing that the feat (of vitalizing dead matter) has been performed yet" (Huxley's 'Brit. Association Address, 1871); and Scripture is emphatic that, if it is protoplasm which makes organized beings, the power which manufactures protoplasm is the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span>, acting in obedience to the <span class="accented">Divine Logos</span>. The time when the earth put forth its verdure, viz., towards the close of the third day, after light, air, earth, and water had been prepared and so adjusted as to minister to the life of plants, was a signal proof of the wisdom of the Creator and of the naturalness of his working.

Has modern geological research any trace of this third day s vegetation? The late Hugh Miller identified the long-continued epoch of profuse vegetation, since then unparalleled in rapidity and luxuriance, which deposited the coal-measures of the carboniferous system, with the latter half of this Mosaic day. Dana, Dawson, and others, rejecting this conclusion of the eminent geologist on the ground that the underlying Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian systems yield abundant fossiliferous remains of aquatic life, infer that the third day's vegetation is to be sought for among the "unresolved schists" of the Azoic period. The metamorphic rocks, it is true, have not as yet yielded any absolutely certain traces of vegetable life; and. indeed, it is an open question, among geologists whether any of the earliest formed metamorphic rocks now remain (cf. Green's 'Geology,' p. 308); but still it is susceptible of almost perfect demonstration that plants preceded animals upon the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Among the hypozoic strata of this early period limestone rocks and graphite have been discovered, both of these being of organic origin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In the process of cooling the earth must have been fitted for vegetable life a long time before animals could have existed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> As the luxuriant vegetation of the coal period prepared the way for the subsequent introduction of animal life by ridding the atmosphere of carbonic acid, so by the presence of plants must the ocean have been fitted to be the abode of aquatic life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Vegetation, being directly, or mediately, the food of animals, must have had a previous existence. On these grounds Professor Dana concludes that the latter part of the Azoic age of geology corresponds with the latter half of the third creative day. In the Creation Series of Chaldean tablets are two fragments, which George Smith conjectures have a reference to the first part of the third day's work.

With this day begins the second half of the creative week, whose works have a striking correspondence with the labors of the first. Having perfected the main structural arrangements of the globe by the elimination from primeval chaos of the four fundamental elements of light, air, water, and land, the formative energy of the Divine word reverts to its initial point of departure, and, in a second series of operations, carries each of these forward to completion - the light by permanently settling it in the sun, the air and water by filling therewith fowl and fish, and the land by making animals and man. The first of these engaged the Divine Artificer's attention on the fourth creative day. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let there be lights</span> (literally, places where light is, light-holders, <a href="../../par/psalms/64-16.htm">Psalm 64:16</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">luminaria</span>, Vulgate; spoken of lamps and candlesticks, <a href="../../par/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>: <a href="../../par/numbers/4-9.htm">Numbers 4:9, 16</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in the firmament</span> (literally the expanse) <span class="cmt_word">of the heaven</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> in the singular with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> in the plural is explained by Gesenius on the ground that the predicate precedes the subject (<span class="accented">vid.</span> 'Gram.,' &sect;147). The scientific accuracy of the language here used to describe the celestial luminaries relieves the Mosaic cosmogony of at least one supposed irreconcilable contradiction, that of <span class="accented">representing</span> light as having an existence independent of the sun. Equally does it dispense exegesis from the necessity of accounting for what appears a threefold creation of the heavenly bodies - in the beginning (ver. 1), on the first day (ver. 3), and again on the fourth (ver. 14). The reference in the last of these verses is not to the original creation of the matter of the supra mundane spheres (Gerlach), which was performed in the beginning, nor to the first production of light, which was the specific work of day one; but to the permanent appointment of the former to be the place, or center of radiation, for the latter.

The greater light is obviously the sun, which is sometimes denominated <span class="accented">chammah</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> warm" (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>); sometimes there, "the glistering" (<a href="../../par/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>); but usually <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, "the minister (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>). Here it is described by its bulk or magnitude, which is larger than that of the moon, the second of the two luminaries, which is also spoken of as great relatively to the stars, which, though in reality immensely exceeding it in size, yet appear like little bails of light (<span class="accented">kokhavim</span>) bestudding the blue canopy of night, and are so depicted - the Biblical narrative being geocentric and phenomenal, not heliocentric or scientific. How the work of this day was effected does not fall within the writer's scope to declare, the precise object of revelation being to teach not astronomy, or any other merely human <span class="accented">gnosis</span>, but religion. Accepting, however, the guidance of physical astronomy, we may imagine that the cosmical light of day one, which had up to this point continued either encompassing our globe like a luminous atmosphere, or existing at a distance from it, but in the plane of the earth's orbit, was now, if in the first of these positions, gradually broken up, doubtless through the shrinking of the earth's mass and the consequent lessening of its power Of attraction, and slowly drawn off towards, and finally concentrated, as a photosphere round the sun, which was thereby constituted chief luminary or "light-holder" the system, the moon and planets becoming, as  a necessary consequence, "light-holders" in the secondary sense of "light-reflectors." It is interesting to note that some such explanation as this appears to have suggested itself to Willet, who wrote before the birth of Newton, and at a time when solar physics and spectrum analysis were things of the remote future. It m not unlike, says he, "but that this light (of the first day), after the creation of the celestial bodies, might be drawn upward and have his reflection upon the beame of the sunne and of other starres" And again, "Whereas the light created the first day is called or, but the starres (meaning the heavenly bodies) are called <span class="accented">meoroth</span>, as of the light, hence it may appear that these lightsome (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> luminous) bodies were made the receptacles of that light thou created, which was now increased and united to these lights" ('Hexapla,' vers. 3, 14, London, 1632); an explanation which, though certainly hypothetical, must be regarded as much more in accordance with the requirements of the sacred text than that which discovers in the making of the lights only a further dissipation of terrestrial mists so as to admit not the light-bringing beams of the celestial bodies alone, but the forms of those shining orbs themselves ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">He made the stars also.</span> Though the stars are introduced solely because of their relation to the earth as dispensers of light, and no account is taken of their constitution as suns and planets, it is admissible to entertain the opinion that, in their case, as in that of the chief luminary of our tellurian heavens, the process of "sun" making reached its culmination on the fourth day. Perhaps the chief reason for their parenthetical introduction in this place was to guard against the notion that there were any luminaries which were not the work of Elohim, and in particular to prevent the Hebrews, for whom the work was written, from yielding to the heathen practices of star-gazing and star-worship. "The superstition of reading the destiny of man in the stars never took root among the Israelites; astrology is excluded by the first principle of Mosaism - the belief in one all-ruling God, who is subject to no necessity, no fate, no other will. Jeremiah warns the Hebrews not to be afraid of the 'signs of heaven,' before which the heathen tremble in vain terror (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>); and Isaiah speaks with taunting irony against the astrologers, star-gazers, and monthly prognosticators, in whose counsel it is folly and wickedness to rely (<a href="../../par/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>). But the Israelites had not moral strength enough to resist the example of star-worship in general; they could not keep aloof from an aberration which formed the very focus of the principal Eastern religions; they yielded to that tempting influence, and ignominious incense rose profusely in honor of the sun and the hosts of heaven - <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>; Wisd. 13:2" (Kalisch).

Laplace was inclined to question the Divine verdict with regard at least to the moon, which he thought might have been so placed as to be always full, whereas, at its present distance from the earth, we are sometimes deprived of both its light and the sun's together. But not to dwell upon the fact that to remove the moon four times its present distance from the earth, which it would require to be in order to be always full, would necessitate important changes in the other members of the solar system which might not be for the earth's advantage, the immediate effect of such a disposition of the lunar orb would be to give us a moon of only one sixteenth the size of that which now dispenses its silver beams upon our darkened globe (<a href="../../par/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>).

The Hebrew writers supply no information as to the astronomical theories which were prevalent in their time; yet "from other sources we have facts leading to the belief that even in the time of Moses there was not a little practical astronomy in the East, and some good theory. The Chaldeans at a very early period had ascertained the principal circles of the sphere, the position of the poles, and the nature of the apparent motions of the heavens as the results of revolution on an inclined axis. The Egyptian astronomers, whom we know through Thales, , taught the true nature of the moon's light, the sphericity of the earth, and the position of its five zones. Pythagoras, , knew, in addition, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the identity of the evening and morning star, and the earth's revolution round the sun" (Dawson, 'O.W.,' p. 207). Modern astronomy, though possessed of highly probable theories as to the formation of the universe, is still unable to speak with absolute precision with regard to this fourth day's work. Yet them are not wanting indirect corroborations of the truth of the Mosaic narrative from both it and geology. According to the sacred writer, the presently existing atmosphere, the distribution of land and water, the succession of day and night, and the regular alternation of the seasons, were established prior to the introduction of animal life upon the earth; and Sir Charles Lyell has demonstrated nothing more successfully than the dominion of "<span class="accented">existing</span> causes" from the Eozoic era downwards, and the sufficiency of these causes to account for all the changes which have taken place in the earth's crust. Again, geology attests the prevalence on our globe in prehistoric times of a much more uniform and high temperature than it now possesses, so late as the Miocene era a genial tropical climate having extended up beyond the Arctic circle, and in the earliest eras of the history of the globe, in all probability, the entire sphere bring so favored with excessive heat. Different causes have been suggested for this phenomenon; as, e.g., the greater heat of the cooling globe (the earliest geologists), a different distribution of land and water (Lyell), variations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit (Herschell and. Croll), changes in the earth's axis (Evans, Drayson, Bell), and the greater intensity of the sun's heat; Sir W Thomson, 'Trans. Geolog. Soc.,' Glasgow, 1877). The Biblical narrative, by distinctly teaching that the sun was perfected on the fourth day, renders it intelligible that his influence on the surface of the earth was then at its greatest, causing tropical climates to prevail and tropical vegetation to abound, both of which have gradually disappeared from the polar regions in consequence of the sun's diminished heat. It remains only to note that the Chaldean Genesis preserves a striking reminiscence of this day's work; the obverse of the fifth creation tablet reading - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It was delightful, all that was fixed by the great gods, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Stars, their appearance (in figures) of animals he arranged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To fix the year through the observation of their constellations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Twelve months (or signs) of stars in three rows he arranged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> From the day when the year commences unto the close. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He marked the positions of the wandering stars (planets) to shine in their courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> The god Uru (the moon) he caused to rise out, the night he overshadowed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">13.</span> To fix it also for the light of the night, until the shining of the day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">19.</span> When the god Shamas (the sun) in the horizon of heaven in the east. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">20.</span> formed beautifully and . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">21.</span> to the orbit Shamas was perfected.

We may, therefore, understand the creative fiat of the fifth day as summoning first into existence the insect creation (in <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20-23</a> defined as <span class="accented">flying sheretzim</span>), the fishes of the sea (<span class="accented">sheretzim</span> of the waters, <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-9.htm">Leviticus 11:9, 10</a>), and the reptiles and saurians of sea and land (<span class="accented">sheretzim</span> of the land, <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-41.htm">Leviticus 11:41, 42</a>).

This does not, of course, contradict the well-known truth that plants are living organisms. Only the life principle of the animal creation is different from that of the vegetable kingdom. It may be impossible by the most acute microscopic analysis to differentiate the protoplasmic cell of vegetable matter from that of animal organisms, and plants may appear to be possessed of functions that resemble those of animals, yet the two are generically different - vegetable protoplasm never weaving animal texture, and plant fiber never issuing from the loom of animal protoplasm.

Principal Dawson inclines to claim for the gigantic foraminifer, <span class="accented">eozoon canadense</span>, of the Laurentian rocks, the honor of being one of the first aquatic creatures that swarmed in terrestrial waters, though Professor Huxley believes that the earliest life is not represented by the oldest known fossils ('Critiques and Addresses,' 9:1873); but, whether then or at some point of time anterior introduced, geology can trace it upwards through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras with the result that is here so exactly defined. Throughout the long ages that fill the interval between the Azoic period of our earth's history and that which witnessed the appearance of the higher animals she is able to detect an unbroken succession of aquatic life, rising gradually from lower to higher forms - from the trilobites and mollusks of the Cambrian and Silurian systems, up through the ganoid fishes of the Devonian and the amphibians of the Carboniferous to the saurian reptiles of the Permian periods. At this point certain ornithic tracks in the superincumbent Triassic strata reveal the introduction upon the scene of winged creatures, and with this accession to its strength and Volume the stream of life flows on till the higher animals appear. Thus geology confirms the Scripture record y attesting <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the priority of marine animals and birds to land animals; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the existence of a period when the great sea monsters, with the smaller aquatic tribes and winged fowls of the air, were the sole living creatures on the globe; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that, precisely as Elohim designed life has continued in unbroken succession since the time of its first introduction. It may also be noted that the Palaeontological history of the earth s crust suggests a number of considerations that enable us to form a conception of the fifth day's work, which, though not contravened by the Mosaic narrative, is yet by it not explicitly disclosed. For example, whereas it might seem to be the teaching of the inspired writer that the <span class="accented">tanninim</span>, the <span class="accented">tomes</span>, and the <span class="accented">birds</span> were created simultaneously, and so were synchronous in their appearance, the testimony of the rocks rather points to a series of creative acts in which successive species of living creatures were summoned into being, as the necessary conditions of existence were prepared for their reception, and indeed with emphasis asserts that the order of creation was not, as in ver. 21, first the great sea monsters, and then the creepers, and then the birds; but first the smaller aquatic tribes, and then the monsters of the deep, and finally the winged creatures of the air. This, however, is not to contradict, but to elucidate, the word of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

As in the third day's work each branch is sealed by the Divine approbation, so in this. The creation of the higher animals completed the earth's preparation for the advent of man; to which, doubtless, the Creator's commendation of his finished work had a special reference. Everything was in readiness for the <span class="accented">magnum opus</span> which was to close his creative labor and crown his completed cosmos. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a></div><div class="verse">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The importance assigned in the Biblical record to the creation of man is indicated by the manner in which it is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let us make man.</span> Having already explained the significance of the term <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, as suggesting the fullness of the Divine personality, and foreshadowing the doctrine of the Trinity (ver. 1), other interpretations, such as that God takes counsel with the angels (Philo, Aben Ezra, Delitzsch), or with the earth (Maimonides, M. Gerumlius), or with himself (Kalisch), must be set aside in favor of that which detects in the peculiar phraseology an allusion to a sublime <span class="accented">concilium</span> among the persons of the Godhead (Calvin, Macdonald, Murphy). The object which this <span class="accented">concilium</span> contemplated was the construction of a new creature to be named <span class="accented">Adam</span>; descriptive of either his <span class="accented">color</span>, from <span class="accented">adam</span>, to be red, (Josephus, Gesenius, Tuch, Hupfeld); or his <span class="accented">appearance</span>, from a root in Arabic which signifies "to shine," thus making Adam "the brilliant one;" or his <span class="accented">compactness</span>, both as an individual and as a race, from another Arabic root which means "to bring or hold together" (Meier, Furst); or his <span class="accented">nature as</span> God's image, from <span class="accented">dam</span>, likeness (Eichorn, Richers); or, and most probably, his <span class="accented">origin</span>, from <span class="accented">adamah</span>, the ground (Kimchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">In our image, after our likeness</span>. The precise relationship in which the nature of the <span class="accented">Adam</span> about to be produced should stand to <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was to be that of a <span class="accented">tselem</span> (shadow - vid. <a href="../../par/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) and a <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness, from <span class="accented">damah</span>, to bring together, to compare - <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). As nearly as possible the terms are synonymous. If any distinction does exist between them, perhaps <span class="accented">tselem</span> (image) denotes the shadow outline of a figure, and <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness) the correspondence or resemblance of that shadow to the figure. The early Fathers were of opinion that the words were expressive of separate ideas: <span class="accented">image</span>, of the body, which by reason of its beauty, intelligent aspect, and erect stature was an adumbration of God; <span class="accented">likeness</span>, of the soul, or the intellectual and moral nature. According to Augustine <span class="accented">image</span> had reference to the <span class="accented">cognitio veritatis</span>; <span class="accented">likeness</span> to <span class="accented">amor virtutis</span>. Irenaeus, Clement, and Origen saw in the first man nature as originally created, and in the second what that nature might become through personal ethical conflict, or through the influence of grace. Bellarmine thought "imaginem in natura, similitudinem in probitate et justitia sitam esse," and conceived that "Adamum peccando non imaginem Dei, sed similitudinero perdidisse." Havernick suggests that image is the concrete, and <span class="accented">likeness</span> the abstract designation of the idea. Modern expositors generally discover no distinction whatever between the words; in this respect following Luther, who renders <span class="accented">an image that is like</span>, and Calvin, who denies that any difference exists between the two. As to what in man constituted the <span class="accented">imago Dei</span>, the reformed theologians commonly held it to have consisted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the spirituality of his being, as an intelligent and free agent; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the moral integrity and holiness of his nature; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his dominion over the creatures (cf. West. Conf., <a href="../../par/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this connection the profound thought of Maimonides, elaborated by Tayler <span class="accented">Lewis</span> (<span class="accented">vial</span>. <span class="accented">Lunge</span>, <span class="accented">in loco</span>), should not be overlooked, that <span class="accented">tselem is</span> the specific, as opposed to the architectural, form of a thing; that which inwardly makes a thing what it is, as opposed to that external configuration which it actually possesses. It corresponds to the <span class="accented">rain</span>, or kind, which determines species among animals. It is that which constitutes 'the genus <span class="accented">homo</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And let them have dominion</span>. The relationship of man to the rest of creation is now defined to be one of rule and supremacy. The employment of the plural is the first indication that not simply an individual was about to be called into existence, but a race, comprising many individuals The range of man's authority is farther specified, and the sphere of his lordship traced by an enumeration in ascending order, from the lowest to the highest, of the subjects placed beneath his sway. His dominion should extend <span class="cmt_word">over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air</span> (literally, the heavens), <span class="cmt_word">and over the cattle</span> (the <span class="accented">behemah</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing</span> (romeo) <span class="cmt_word">that creepeth upon the earth.</span>

The threefold parallelism of the members of this verse is likewise suggestive, as Umbreit, Ewald, and Delitzsch remark, of the jubilation with which the writer contemplates the crowning work of Elohim's creative word. Murphy notices two stages in man's creation, the general fact being stated in the first clause of this triumphal song, and the two particulars - first his relation to his Maker, and second his sexual distinction - in its other members. In the third clause Luther sees an intimation "that the woman also was created by God, and made a partaker of the Divine image, and of dominion over all."

"Carte fraenum viris et mulieribus non laxavit, at in vagus libidines ruerent, absque delectu et pudore; seda sancto castoque conjugio incipiens, descendit ad generationem" (Calvin). <span class="cmt_word">And replenish the earth</span>. The new-created race was intended to occupy the earth. How far during the first age of the world this Divine purpose was realized continues matter of debate (<a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>.). After the Flood the confusion of tongues effected a dispersion of the nations over the three great continents of the old world. At the present day man has wandered to the ends of the earth.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a></div><div class="verse">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which <i>is</i> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which <i>is</i> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Provision for the sustenance of the newly-appointed monarch and his subjects is next made. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</span> Of the three classes into which the vegetable creation was divided, grass, herbs, and trees (ver. 12), the two last were assigned to man for food. Macdonald thinks that without this express conveyance man would have been warranted to partake of them for nourishment, warranted by the necessities of his nature. The same reasoning, however, would have entitled him to kill the lower animals if he judged them useful for his support. Murphy with more truth remarks, "Of two things proceeding from the same creative hand, neither has any original or inherent right to interfere in any way with the other. The absolute right to each lies in the Creator alone. The one, it is true, may need the other to support its life, as fruit is needful to man; and, therefore, the just Creator cannot make one creature dependent for subsistence on another without granting to it the use of that other. But this is a matter between Creator and creature, and not by any means between creature and creature." The primitive charter of man's common property in the earth, and all that it contains, is the present section of this ancient document. Among other reasons for the formal conveyance to man of the herbs and trees may be noted a desire to keep him mindful of his dependent condition. Though lord of the creation, he was yet to draw the means of his subsistence from the creature which he ruled. Whether man was a vegetarian prior to the fall is debated. On the one hand it is contended that the original grant does not formally exclude the animals, and, in fact, says nothing about man's relation to the animals (Macdonald); that we cannot positively affirm that man's dominion over the animals did not involve the use of them for food (Murphy); and that as men offered sacrifices from their flocks, it is probable they ate the flesh of the victims (Calvin), On the other hand it is argued that the Divine language cannot be held as importing morn than it really says, arid that <a href="../../par/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a> distinctly teaches that man's right to the animal creation dates from the time of Noah (Kalisch, Knobel, Alford, &c.). Almost all nations have traditions of a golden age of innocence, when men abstained from killing animals (cf. Ovid, 'Met.,' 1:103-106). Scripture alone anticipates a. time when such shall again be a characteristic of earth's inhabitants (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-7.htm">Isaiah 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>).

From this Delitzsch infers that prior to the introduction of sin the animals were not predaceous. The geological evidence of the existence of death in prehistoric times is, however, too powerful to be resisted; and the Biblical record itself enumerates among the pre-adamic animals the chayyah of the field, which clearly belonged to the carnivora. Perhaps the most that can be safely concluded from the language is "that it indicates merely the general fact that the support of the whole animal kingdom is based on vegetation" (Dawson).

The alleged evidence of prehistoric man is too fragmentary and hypothetical to be accepted as conclusive; and yet, so far as the cosmogony of the present chapter is concerned, there is nothing to prevent the belief that man is of a much more remote antiquity than 6000 years.

Yet the lapse of upwards of twenty years since that former mistake may have deadened the impression of sinfulness which Pharaoh's rebuke must have left upon his conscience; while altogether the result of that experiment may, through a common misinterpretation of Divine providence, have encouraged him to think that God would watch over the purity of his house as he had done before.

Abraham's desire for a grave m which to deposit Sarah's lifeless remains was dictated by that Divinely planted and, among civilized nations, universally prevailing reverence for the body which prompts men to decently dispose of their dead by rites of honorable sepulture. The burning of corpses was a practice common to the nations of antiquity; but Tacitus notes it as characteristic of the Jews that they preferred interment to cremation ('Hist.,' 5:5). The wish to make Sarah's burying-place his own possession has been traced to the instinctive desire that most nations have evinced to lie in ground belonging to themselves (Rosenm&uuml;ller), to an intention on the part of the patriarch to give a sign of his right and title to the land of Canaan by purchasing a grave in its soil - cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a> (Bush), or simply to anxiety that his dead might not lie unburied (Calvin); but it was more probably due to his strong faith that the land would yet belong to his descendants, which naturally led him to crave a resting-place in the soil with which the hopes of both himself and people were identified (Ainsworth, Bush, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">That I may bury my dead out of my sight</span> - decay not suffering the lifeless corpse to remain a fit spectacle for grief or love to gaze on.

At least it seems questionable to conclude that Ephron's generous phrases, which have now become formal and hollow courtesies indeed, meant no more in that simpler age when the ceremonies of intercourse were newer, and more truly reflected its spirit (Dykes, 'Abraham, the Friend of God,' p. 287). <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of the ions of my people give I it thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have I given</span>, the transaction being viewed as finished): <span class="cmt_word">bury thy dead.</span>

Of course the Gordian knot of difficulty may be very readily cut by boldly asserting that a mistake has been committed somewhere; either by Stephen, the original speaker, under the impulse of emotion confounding the two entirely different stories of Abraham's purchase of Machpelah and Jacob's buying of the field near Shechem (Beds, Clarke, Lange, Kalisch, Alford, and others); or by Luke, the first recorder of the Martyr's Apology, who wrote not the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the speech, but simply his own recollection of them (Jerome); or by some subsequent transcriber who had tampered with the original text, as, e.g., inserting <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, which Luke and Stephen both had omitted, as the nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (Beza, Calvin, Bishop Pearce). The Just of these hypotheses would not indeed be fatal to the Inspiration of the record; but the claims of either Luke or Stephen to be authoritative teachers on the subject of religion would be somewhat hard to maintain if it once were admitted that they had blundered on a plain point in their own national history. And yet it is doubtful if any of the proposed solutions of the problem is perfectly satisfactory; such as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the two purchases of Abraham and Jacob are here intentionally, for the sake of brevity, compressed into one account (Bengel, Pererius, Willet, Hughes); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Abraham bought two graves, one at Hebron of Ephron the Hittite, as recorded by Moses, and another at Shechem of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem (Words. worth); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the words "which Abraham bought for a sum of money" should be regarded as a parenthesis, and the sentence read as intimating that Jacob and the fathers were carried over into Shechem, and (afterwards) by the sons of Hamor the lather of Shechem interred in Abraham's sepulcher at Hebron (Cajetan). Obvious difficulties attach to each of them; but the facts shine out clear enough in spite of the encompassing obscurity, viz., that Abraham bought a tomb at Hebron, in which first the dust of Sarah was deposited, and to which afterwards the bodies of himself, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were consigned, while Joseph and the twelve patriarchs, who all died in Egypt, were brought over to the promised land and buried in Jacob's field at Shechem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said auto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to his servant, the old man</span>, ancient or elder, <span class="accented">of his house, the ruler over all which</span> (sc. belonged) <span class="accented">to him</span>. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (an old man) is in most languages employed as a title of honor, - cf. <span class="accented">sheikh, senatus</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">presbyter</span>, signor, seigneur, senor, sir (Gesenius, p. 252), - and is probably to be so understood here. Eliezer of Damascus, upwards of half a century previous regarded as heir presumptive to Abraham's house (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), is commonly considered the official meant, though the point is of no importance - <span class="cmt_word">Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear.</span> This ancient form of adjuration, which is mentioned again only in chap. 47:29, and to which nothing analogous can elsewhere be discovered, - the practice alleged to exist among the modern Egyptian Bedouins of placing the hand upon the <span class="accented">membrum virile</span> in solemn forms of asseveration not forming an exact parallel, was probably originated by the patriarch. The thigh, as the source of posterity (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>), has been regarded as pointing to Abraham's future descendants (Keil, Kalisch, Lange), and in particular to Christ, the promised seed (Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth), and the oath to be equivalent to a swearing by him that was to come. By others the thigh has been viewed as euphemistically put for the generative organ, upon which the sign of circumcision was placed, and the oath as an adjuration by the sign of the covenant (Jonathan, Jarchi, Tuch). A third interpretation considers the thigh as symbolizing lordship or authority, and the placing of the hand under it as tantamount to an oath of fealty and allegiance to a superior (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Calvin, Murphy). Other explanations are modifications of the above. <span class="cmt_word">By the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; since the marriage to which this solemn adjuration was preliminary was not an ordinary alliance, such as might have taken place under the providence of Elohim, but the wedding of the heir of the promise), <span class="cmt_word">the God of heaven, and the God of the earth</span> (a clause defining Jehovah as the supreme Lord of the universe, and therefore as the sole Arbiter of human destiny), <span class="cmt_word">that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son</span> - not investing him with authority to provide a wife for Isaac in the event of death carrying him (Abraham) off before his son's marriage, but simply explaining the negative side of the commission with which he was about to be entrusted. If it evinced Isaac's gentle disposition and submissive piety, that though forty years of age he neither thought of marriage, but mourned in devout contemplation for his mother (,Lange), nor offered resistance to his father s proposal, but suffered himself to be governed by a servant (Calvin), it was also quite in accordance with ancient practice that parents should dispose of their children in marriage (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> Being prompted to this partly by that jealousy with which all pastoral tribes of Shemitie origin have been accustomed to guard the purity of their race by intermarriage (Dykes; cf. Thomson, 'Land and Book,' p. 591), and partly no doubt by his perception of the growing licentiousness of the Canaanites, as well as his knowledge of their predicted doom, though chiefly, it is probable, by a desire to preserve the purity of the promised seed. Intermarriage with the Canaanites was afterwards forbidden by the Mosaic legislation (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, for, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former thing must not be done because this must be done) <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt go unto my country</span> (not Ur of the Chaldees, but the region beyond the Euphrates generally), <span class="cmt_word">and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</span> Though enforced by religious considerations, this injunction to bring none but a relative for Isaac's bride "was in no sense a departure from established usages and social laws in regard to marriage" ('Land and Book,' p. 591).

The less frequent occurrence of the Divine name in the Thol-doth of Isaac than in those of Terah has been explained by the fact that the historical matter of the later portion furnishes less occasion for its introduction than that of the earlier; and the predominance of the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> over that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in the second stage of the patriarchal history has been partly ascribed to the employment after Abraham's time of such like equivalent expressions as "God of Abraham" and "God of my father" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">for his wife,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">opposite to</span> his wife, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. beside his wife, placing himself opposite her, and conjoining his supplications with hers (Ainsworth, Bush); or, better, in behalf of his wife (<span class="accented">LXX</span>., Vulgate, Calvin, Keil, Kalisch), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting her over against him as the sole object to which he had regard in his intercessions (Luther) - <span class="cmt_word">because she was barren</span>: - as Sarah had been before her (<span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 11:80); the long-continued sterility of both having been designed to show partly that "children are the heritage of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>), but chiefly that the children of the promise were to be not simply the fruit of nature, but the gift of grace <span class="cmt_word">and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10</a>).

Not by Urim (Bohlen), since this method of inquiring at the Deity did not then exist (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>); but either through a prophet, - Shem (Luther), Melchisedeck (Jewish interpreters), Heber (Lyra); more likely Abraham (Grotius, Ainsworth, Wordsworth, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or Isaac, the prophet nearest her (Lange), - or through herself by prayer, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a> (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, Murphy, Inglis).

That Isaac should have resorted to the miserable expedient of his father may have been due simply to a lack of originality on the part of Isaac; or perhaps the recollection of the success which had attended his father's adoption of this wretched subterfuge may have blinded him to its true character.

Abimelech and his ministers first explain the motive which has impelled them to solicit a renewal of the old alliance - <span class="cmt_word">that the Lord was with thee</span>: - the use of Jehovah instead of Elohim, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>, does not prove that this is a Jehovistic elaboration of the earlier legend. Neither is it necessary to suppose that the term Jehovah is a Mosaic translation of the epithet employed by Abimelech (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The long-continued residence of Abraham in Gemr and Beersheba afforded ample opportunity for Abimelech becoming acquainted with the patriarch's God. The introduction of Jehovah into the narrative may be noted as a third point of dissimilarity between this and the previous account - <span class="cmt_word">and we said, Let there he now an oath</span> - i.e. a treaty secured by an oath or self-imprecation on the transgressor (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/24-41.htm">Genesis 24:41</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee</span>, - a farther particularization of the parties to the covenant for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and let us make a covenant with thee</span>. The phrase "to cut a covenant," here used in a so-called Jehovistic portion of the history, occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-27.htm">Genesis 21:27, 32</a>, which confessedly belongs to the fundamental document.

Regarded by some as an instance of adroit and pious flattery, these words are perhaps better understood as explaining either why Isaac should overlook the injuries which they had done to him (Calvin, Bush), or why he should grant them the oath which they desired (Ainsworth), - he requiring no guarantee of safety from them, since Jehovah was on his side (Murphy), - or why they had been stirred up to seek his favor and alliance (Rosenm&uuml;ller).

But Jacob was born in Isaac's sixtieth year (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>); hence Isaac was now one hundred and thirty-seven. There are, however, difficulties connected with this reckoning which lay it open to suspicion. For one thing, it postpones Jacob s marriage to an extremely late period. Then it takes for granted that the term of Jacob's service in Padan-aram was only twenty years (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>), whereas it is not certain whether it was not forty, made up, according to the computation of Kennicott, of fourteen years' service, twenty years' assistance as a neighbor, and six years of work for wages. And, lastly, it necessitates the birth of Jacob's eleven children in the short space of six years, a thing which appears to some, it not impossible, at least highly improbable. Adopting the larger number as the term of Jacob s sojourn in Mesopotamia, Isaac would at this time be only one hundred and seventeen (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Chronologer of Jacob's Life,' 31:41) - <span class="cmt_word">and his eyes were dim,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">were failing in strength</span>, hence becoming dim (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>).

The phrase, though not included in Isaac's address to Esau, need not be regarded as due to Rebekah's invention. She may have understood it to be implied in her husband's language, though it was not expressed (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>). That it was designedly omitted by Isaac in consequence of the worldly character of Esau appears as little likely as that it was deliberately inserted by Rebekah to whet her favorite's ambition (Kalisch). As to meaning, the sense may be that this patriarchal benediction was to be bestowed sincerely (Menochius), in presence and by the authority of God (Ainsworth, Bush, Clericus); but the use of the term <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> rather points to the idea that Rebekah regarded Isaac simply "as the instrument of the living and personal God, who directed the concerns of the chosen race (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Before my death.</span> Since Rebekah makes no remark as to the groundlessness of Isaac s fear, it is not improbable that she too shared in her bed-ridden husband's expectations that already he was "in the presence of" his end.

They were probably festive garments of the princely hunter (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">which were with her in the house,</span> - not because Esau saw that his wives were displeasing to his parents (Mercerus, Willet), or because they were sacred garments (Ainsworth, Poole), but probably because Esau, though married, had not yet quitted the patriarchal household (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and put them upon Jacob her younger son.</span> The verb, being in the hiphil, conveys the sense of causing Jacob to clothe himself, which entirely removes the impression that Jacob was a purely involuntary agent in this deceitful and deeply dishonorable affair.

Esau was at this time a man of mature age, being either fifty-seven or seventy-seven years old, and must have been acquainted with the heavenly oracle (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) that assigned the precedence in the theocratic line to Jacob. Zither, therefore, he must have supposed that his claim to the blessing was not thereby affected, or he was guilty of conniving at Isaac's scheme for resisting the Divine will. Indignation at Jacob's duplicity and baseness, combined with sympathy for Esau in his supposed wrongs, sometimes prevents a just appreciation of the exact position occupied by the latter in this extraordinary transaction. Instead of branding Jacob as a shameless deceiver, and hurling against his fair fame the most opprobrious epithets, may it not be that, remembering the previously-expressed will of Heaven, the real supplanter was Esau, who as an accomplice of his father was seeking secretly, unlawfully, and feloniously to appropriate to himself a blessing which had already been, not obscurely, designated as Jacob's? On this hypothesis the miserable craft of Jacob and Rebekah was a lighter crime than that of Isaac and Esau.

On the other hand, it is felt to be somewhat arbitrary to assign to the preposition a partitive sense in ver. 28 and a privative in ver. 39. Though called in later times (<a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>) a waste and desolate region, it may not have been originally so, or only in comparison with Canaan; while according to modern travelers the glens and mountain terraces of Edom, covered with rich soil, only want an industrious population to convert the entire region into "one of the wealthiest, as it is one of the most picturesque, countries in the world."

The exact rendering of the clause is obscure, but perhaps means that when Edom should roam about as a freebooter (Lange), or should revolt (Alford), or should toss, shake, or struggle against the yoke (Vulgate, Keil, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary), he should succeed. Other renderings are, when thou shalt bear rule (Kimchi), when thou shalt repent (Jarchi), when thou shalt be strong (Samaritan), when thou prevailest (Murphy), when thou shalt truly desire it (Kalisch), when thou shalt pull down (LXX.); because thou art restless (Havernick). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 27:41-46

That which reconciled Isaac and Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>), the death of a father, is here mentioned as the event which would decisively and finally part Esau and Jacob.

It was probably a heathen imitation of the rite here recorded, though by some authorities (Keil, Knobel, Lange) the Baetylian worship is said to have been connected chiefly with meteoric stones which were supposed to have descended from some divinity; as, e. g., the stone in Delphi sacred to Apollo; that in Emesa, on the Orontes, consecrated to the sun; the angular rock at Pessinus in Phrygia worshipped as hallowed by Cybele; the black stone in the Kaaba at Mecca believed to have been brought from heaven by the angel Gabriel (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kalisch in /Gee). That the present narrative was a late invention, "called into existence by a desire" on the part of the priests and prophets of Yahweh (Jehovah) "<span class="accented">to</span> proclaim the high antiquity of the sanctuary at Bethel, and to make a sacred stone harmless" ('The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231), is pure assumption. The circumstance that the usage here mentioned is nowhere else in Scripture countenanced (except in <a href="../../par/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, with reference to this same pillar) forms a sufficient pledge of the high antiquity of the narrative (<span class="accented">vied</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' &sect; 20).

Rosenm&uuml;ller and Kalisch find a connection between Bethel and Baetylia, the former regarding Beetylia as a corruption of Bethel, and the latter viewing Bethel as the Hebraised form of Beetylion.

She must herself have been attached to Jacob; and it is probable that Laban had explained to her his plan for bringing about a double wedding.

Perhaps he saw the hand of God in what had happened, and probably considered that though he had chosen Rachel, God had selected Leah as his wife. If so, it must be set to Jacob's credit that at the call of God, thus providentially addressed to him, he was prepared to sacrifice his best affections to the claims of religion and duty.

The expression is a pure anthropomorphism. "He who fainteth not, neither is weary" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>), can be conceived of neither as resting nor as needing rest through either exhaustion or fatigue. Cessation from previous occupation is all that is implied in the figure, and is quite compatible with continuous activity in other directions. <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a> represents the Father as working from that period onward in the preservation and redemption of that world which by his preceding labors he had created and made.

Literally, declared it holy, or set it apart for holy purposes. As afterwards Mount Sinai was sanctified (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a>), or, for the time being, invested with a sacred character as the residence of God; and Aaron and his sons were sanctified, or consecrated to the priestly office (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>); and the year of Jubilee was sanctified, or devoted to the purposes of religion (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), so here was the seventh day sanctified, or instituted in the interests of holiness, and as such proclaimed to be a holy day. <span class="cmt_word">Because that in it he had</span> <span class="cmt_word">rested from all his work which God had created and made</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">created to make</span>, the exact import of which has been variously explained.

Calvin, Ainsworth, Bush, <span class="accented">et alii</span> take the second verb <span class="accented">emphatice</span>, as intensifying the action of the first, and conveying the idea of a perfect creation. Kalisch, Alford, and others explain the second as <span class="accented">epexegetic</span> of the first, as in the similar phrases, "spoke, saying, literally, spoke to speak" (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and "<span class="accented">labor</span>ed to do" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>). Onkelos, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">quod Dens creavit ut faceret</span>), Calvin, Tayler Lewis, &c. understand the infinitive in a <span class="accented">relic</span> sense, as expressive of the purpose for which the heavens and the earth were at first created, viz., that by the six days' work they might be fashioned into a cosmos. It has been observed that the usual concluding formula is not appended to the record of the seventh day, and the reason has perhaps been declared by Augustine: "Dies autem septimus sine vespera eat, nee habet occasum, quia sanctificasti eum ad permansionem sempiternam" ('Confess.,' 13:36). But now what was this seventh day which received Elohim's benediction? On the principle of interpretation applied to the creative days, this must be regarded as a period of indefinite duration, compounding to the human era of both Scripture and geology. But other Scriptures (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-12.htm">Deuteronomy 5:12</a>, &c.) show that the Hebrews were enjoined by God to observe a seventh day rest in imitation of himself. There are also indications that sabbatic observance was not unknown to the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27, 28</a>), to the antediluvians (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6-12</a>), and to Cain and Abel (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>). Profane history likewise vouches for the veracity of the statement of Josephus, that "there is not any city of the Grecians, nor any of the barbarians, nor any nation whatsoever, whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not come" ('Contra Apionem,' 2:40). The ancient Persians, Indians, and Germans esteemed the number seven as sacred. By the Greeks and Phoenicians a sacred character was ascribed to the seventh day. The Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity were acquainted with the hebdomadal division of time. Travelers have detected traces of it among the African and American aborigines. To account for its existence among nations so widely apart, both chronologically and geographically, recourse has been had to some violent hypotheses; as, e.g., to the number of the primary planets known to the ancients (Humboldt), the division of a lunar month into four nearly equal periods of seven days (Ideler, Baden Powell, &c.), Jewish example (Josephus). Its true genesis, however, must be sought for in the primitive observance of a seventh day rest in accordance with Divine appointment. Precisely as we reason that the early and widespread prevalence of sacrifice can only be explained by an authoritative revelation to the first parents of the human family of such a mode of worship, so do we conclude that a seventh day sabbath must have been prescribed to man in Eden. The question then arises, Is this sabbath also referred to in the Mosaic record of the seventh day? The popular Belief is that the institution of the weekly sabbath alone is the subject spoken of in the opening verses of the present chapter; and the language of <a href="../../par/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> may at first sight appear to warrant this conclusion. A more careful consideration of the phraseology employed by Moses, how ever, shows that in the mind of the Hebrew lawgiver there existed a distinction between God's seventh day and man's sabbath, and that, instead of identifying the two, he meant to teach that the first was the reason of the second; as thus - "In six days God made.... and rested on the seventh day; where fore God blessed the (weekly) sabbath day, and hallowed it." Here it is commonly assumed that the words are exactly parallel to those in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, and that the sabbath in Exodus corresponds to the seventh day of Genesis. But this is open to debate. The seventh day which God blessed in Eden was the first day of human life, and not the seventh day; and it is certain that God did not rest from his labors on man's seventh day, but on man's first. We feel inclined then to hold with Luther that in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> Moses says nothing about man's day, and that the seventh day which received the Divine benediction was God's own great aeonian period of sabbatic rest. At the same time, for the reasons above specified, believing that a weekly sabbath was pre scribed to man from the beginning, we have no difficulty in assenting to the words of Tayler Lewis: "'And God blessed the seventh day.' Which seventh day, the greater or the less, the Divine or the human, the aeonian or the astronomical? Both, is the easy answer; both, as commencing at the same time, so far as the one connects with astronomical time; both, as the greater including the less; both, as being (the one as represented, the other as typically representing) the same essence and idea." It does not appear necessary to refute the idea that the weekly sabbath had no existence till the giving of the law, and that it is only here proleptically referred to by Moses. In addition to the above-mentioned historical testimonies to the antiquity of the Sabbath, the Fifth Tablet in the Chaldean Creation Series, after referring to the fourth day's work, proceeds: -   <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"On the seventh day he appointed a holy day,<br />And to cease from all business he commanded.<br />Then arose the sun in the horizon of heaven in (glory)."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>thus apparently affirming that, in the opinion of the early Babylonians, the institution of the sabbath was coeval with the creation.

Misled by the LXX., who render <span class="accented">toldoth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Ranks, Title, Havernick, Tuch, Ewald, and Stahelin disconnect the entire verse from the second section, which says nothing about the origination of the heavens and the earth, and append it to the preceding, in which their creation is described. Ilgen improves on their suggestion by transferring it to the commencement of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as an appropriate superscription. Dreschler, Vaihingel Bohlen, Oehler, Macdonald, <span class="accented">et alii</span> divide the verse into two clauses, and annex the former to what precedes, commencing the ensuing narrative with the latter. All of these proposals are, however, rendered unnecessary by simply observing that <span class="accented">toldoth</span> (from <span class="accented">yaladh</span>, to bear, to beget; hence begettings, procreations, evolutions, developments) does not describe the antecedents, but the consequents, of either thing or Person (Rosen., Keil, Kalisch). <span class="accented">The toldoth</span> of Noah are not the genealogical list of the patriarch's ancestry, but the tabulated register of his posterity; and so the generations <span class="cmt_word">of the heavens and the earth</span> refer not to their original production (Gesenius), but to their onward movements from creation downwards (Keil). Hence with no incongruity, but with singular propriety, the first half of the present verse, ending with the words <span class="cmt_word">when they were created</span>, literally, <span class="accented">in tier creation</span>, stands at the commencement of the section in which the forward progression of the universe is traced. The point of departure in this subsequent evolution of the material heavens and earth is further specified as being <span class="cmt_word">in the day that the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">made the earth and the heavens</span>; not the heavens and the earth, which would have signified the universe (cf. on Genesis 1:1), and carried hack the writer s thought to the initial act of creation; but the earth and the atmospheric firmament, which indicates the period embracing the second and (possibly) the third creative days as the <span class="accented">terminus aguo</span> of the generations to be forthwith recorded. Then it was that the heavens and the earth in their development took a clear and decided step forward in the direction of man and the human family (was it in the appearance of vegetation?); and in this thought perhaps will be found the key to the significance of the new name for the Divine Being which is used exclusively throughout the present section - <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah Elohim</span>. From the frequency of its use, and the circumstance that it never has the article, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah</span> may be regarded as the proper Personal name of God. Either falsely interpreting <a href="../../par/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, or following some ancient superstition (mysterious names of deities were used generally in the East; the Egyptian Hermes had a name which (Cic. 'de Natura Deorum,' 8, 16) durst not be uttered: Furst), the later Hebrews invested this <span class="accented">nomen</span> <span class="accented">tetra</span>. <span class="accented">grammaton</span> with such sanctity that it might not bepronounced (Philo, Vit. <span class="accented">Mosis</span>, 3:519, 529). Accordingly, it was their custom to write it in the sacred text with the vowel points of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, or, if that preceded, Elohim. Hence considerable doubt now exists as to its correct pronunciation. Etymologically viewed it is a future form of <span class="accented">havah</span>, an old form of <span class="accented">hayah</span>; uncertainty as to what future has occasioned many different suggestions as to what constituted its primitive vocalization. According to the evidence which scholars have collected, the choice lies between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jahveh (Gesenius, Ewald, Reland, Oehler, Macdonald, the Samaritan), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yehveh or Yeheveh (Furst, W. L. Alexander, in Kitto's 'Cyclopedia'), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jehovah (Michaelis, Meyer, Stier, Hoelmann, Tregelles, Murphy). Perhaps the preponderance of authority inclines to the first; but the common punctuation is not so indefensible as some writers allege. Gesenius admits that it more satisfactorily accounts for the abbreviated syllables <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> than the pronunciation which he himself favors. Murphy thinks that the substitution of Adonai for Jehovah was facilitated by the agreement of their vowel points. <span class="accented">The locus classicus</span> for its signification is <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, in which God defines himself as "I am that I am," and commands Moses to tell the children of Israel that <span class="accented">Ehyeh</span> had sent him. Hengstenberg and Keil conclude that absolute self-existence is the essential idea represented by the name (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4, 8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vd</span>. Furst, 'Lex. sub nora.'). Baumgarten and Delitzsch, laying stress on its future form, regard it as   =   the Becoming One, with reference to the revelation, rather than the essence, of the Divine nature. Macdonald, from the circumstance that it was not used till after the fall, discovers a pointing forward to Jehovah <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in connection with redemption. Others, deriving from a hiphil future, take it as denoting "<span class="accented">he</span> who causes to be, the Fulfiller," and find in this an explanation of <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a> (Exell). May not all these ideas be more or less involved in the fullness of the Divine name? As distinguished from Elohim, <span class="accented">Deus omnipotens</span>, the mighty One, Jehovah is the absolute, self-existent One, who manifests himself to man, and, in particular, enters into distinct covenant engagements for his redemption, which he in due time fulfils. In the present section the names are conjoined partly to identify Jehovah with Elohim, and partly because the subject of which it treats is the history of man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i>there was</i> not a man to till the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every plant of the field before it was</span> (literally, not yet) <span class="cmt_word">in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew</span> (literally, had not yet sprouted). Following the LXX., the English Version suggests an intention on the writer's part to emphasize the fact that the vegetation of the globe - here comprehended under the general terms, <span class="accented">shiah</span>, shrub, and <span class="accented">eseb</span>, herb - was not a natural production, but, equally with the great earth and heavens, was the creation of Jehovah Elohim - a rendering which has the sanction of Taylor Lewis; whereas the writer's object clearly is to depict the appearance of the earth at the time when the man-ward development of the heavens and the earth began. Then not a single plant was in the ground, not a green blade was visible. The land, newly sprung from the waters, was one desolate region of bleak, bare lava-hills and extensive mud-fiats. Up to that point the absence of vegetation is accounted for by the circumstance that the presently existing atmospheric conditions of the globe had not then been established, <span class="cmt_word">for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth</span>, and the ordinary agricultural operations on which its production was afterwards to depend had not then been begun, <span class="cmt_word">and there was not a man to till the ground</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</span> The dry land having been separated from the waters, and the atmospheric ocean uplifted above them both, vaporous exhalations began to ascend to the aerial regions, and to return again in the shape of rain upon the ground. Jehovah thus <span class="accented">caused it to rain</span> upon the ground, and so prepared it for the vegetation which, in obedience to the Almighty fiat, sprung up at the close of the third day, although the writer does not mention its appearance, but leaves it to be inferred from the preceding section. That soon after its emergence from the waters the land should be "dry, sterile, and sandy" will not be thought remarkable if we remember the highly igneous condition of our planet at the time when the dry land was upheaved and the waters gathered into the subsiding valleys. Nothing would more naturally follow that event than the steaming up of vapors to float in the aerial sea. In fact, the rapidity with which evaporation would be carried on would very speedily leave the newly-formed land hard and dry, baked and caked into a crust, till the atmosphere, becoming overcharged with aqueous vapor, returned it in the shape of rain. To talk of insuperable difficulty and manifest dissonance where everything is clear, natural, and harmonious is to speak at random, and betrays an anxiety to create contradictions rather than to solve them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God formed man <i>of</i> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">formed man of the dust of the ground.</span> Literally, dust from the ground. Here, again, Bleek, Kalisch, and the theologians of their school discover contrariety between this account of man's creation and that which has been given in the preceding chapter. <span class="accented">In that</span> man is represented as having been created by the Divine word, in the Divine image, and male and female simultaneously; whereas <span class="accented">in this</span> his creation is exhibited as a painful process of elaboration from the clay by the hand of God, who works it like a potter (<span class="accented">asah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), and, after having first constructed man, by a subsequent operation forms woman. But the first account does not assert that Adam and Eve were created together, and gives no details of the formation of either. These are supplied by the present narrative, which, beginning with the construction of his body from the fine dust of the ground, designedly represents it as an evolution or development of the material universe, and ends by setting it before us as animated by the breath of God, reserving for later treatment the mode of Eve's production, when the circumstances that led to it have been described. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (the Lord God) <span class="cmt_word">breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span> Literally, the breath of lives. "The formation of man from the dust and the breathing of the breath of life must not be understood in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from the dust" (still less does it admit of the idea that man's physical nature was evolved from the lower animals), "and then, by breathing his breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. By an act of Divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the Divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">And man became a</span> <span class="cmt_word">living soul</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>, in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, 80, is employed to designate the lower animals. Describing a being animated by a <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> or life principle, it does not necessarily imply that the basis of the life principle in man and the inferior animals is the same. The distinction between the two appears from the difference in the mode of their creations. The beasts arose at the almighty fiat completed beings, every one a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>. "The origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life with which all matter was filled at the beginning by the Spirit of God" (Delitzsch). Man received his life from a distinct act of Divine inbreathing; certainly not an in-breathing of atmospheric air, but an inflatus from the Ruach Elohim, or Spirit of God, a communication from the whole personality of the Godhead. In effect man was thereby constituted a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, like the lower animals; but in him the life principle conferred a personality which was wanting in them. Thus there is no real contradiction, scarcely even an "<span class="accented">apparent</span> dissonance," between the two accounts of man's creation. The second exhibits the foundation of that likeness to God and world-dominion ascribed to him in the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground made the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</span> - literally, lovely to see; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> beautiful in form and color - <span class="cmt_word">and good for food</span>. In the preparation of man's pristine abode respect was had to ornamentation as well as utility. Every species of vegetation that could minister to his corporeal necessities was provided. Flowers, trees, and shrubs regaled his senses with their fragrance, pleased his eye with their exquisite forms and enchanting colors, and gratified his palate with their luscious fruits. Hence the garden of the Lord became the highest ideal of earthly excellence (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). In particular it was distinguished by the presence of two trees, which occupied a central position among its multifarious productions. <span class="cmt_word">The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span> That these were not two separate trees, but only one tree distinguished by different names, has been maintained, though with no weightier reason than the statement of Eve in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>. The opinion of Witsius, Luther, Kennicott, and Hengstenberg, that classes of trees, and not individual trees, are meant by the phrases "tree of life" and "tree of knowledge," is precluded by the language of Jehovah Elohim in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>. As regards their significance, consistency requires that they should both be explained on the same principle. This, accordingly, disposes of the idea that the tree of life (literally, the tree of the lives: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; 20:19) is simply a Hebraism for <span class="accented">a living tree</span>, as by no sort of ingenuity can the tree of knowledge be transformed into <span class="accented">a knowing tree</span>. It likewise militates against the notion that the two trees were styled from the peculiar effects of their fruits, the one conferring physical immortality on Adam's body (Scotus, Aquinas, Fairbairn, Kalisch, Luther), and the other imparting moral and intellectual intuitions to his soul (Josephus, Kalisch). But even if the life-giving properties of the one tree could be demonstrated from <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, proof would still be required with regard to the other, that the mere physical processes of manducation and digestion could be followed by results so immaterial as those of "rousing the slumbering intellect, teaching reason to reflect, and enabling the judgment to distinguish between moral good and moral evil" (Kalisch). Besides, if this was the immediate effect of eating the forbidden fruit, it is difficult to perceive either why it should have been prohibited to our first parents at all, it being "for their good to have their wits sharpened" (Willet); or in what respect they suffered loss through listening to the tempter, and did not rather gain (Rabbi Moses); or wherein, being destitute of both intellectual and moral discernment, they could be regarded as either guilty of transgression or responsible for obedience. Incapacity to know good and evil may be a characteristic of unconscious childhood and unreflecting youth (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), or of debilitated age (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>), but is not conceivable in the case of one who was created in God's image, invested with world-dominion, and himself constituted the subject of moral government. Unless, therefore, with ancient Gnostics and modern Hegelians, we view the entire story of the probation as an allegorical representation of the necessary intellectual and ethical development of human nature, we must believe that Adam was acquainted with the idea of moral distinctions from the first. Hence the conclusion seems to force itself upon our minds that the first man was possessed of both immortality and knowledge irrespective altogether of the trees, and that the tree character which belonged to these trees was symbolical or sacramental, suggestive of the conditions under which he was placed in Eden. "Arbori autem vitae nomen indidit, non quod vitam homini conferrer, qua jam ante praeditus erat; sod ut symbolum ac memoriale esset vitae divinitus acceptae" (Calvin). For a further exposition of the exact significance of these trees see below on vers. 16,17.

Nothing more is implied in the language than that a great watercourse proceeded through the district of Eden, and served to irrigate the soil. Probably it intersected the garden, thus occasioning its remarkable fecundity and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> either on emerging from which, or, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;</span> in its secondary sense, outside of, or at a distance from which) <span class="cmt_word">it was parted</span> (literally, divided itself), <span class="cmt_word">and became into four heads.</span> <span class="accented">Roshim</span>, from <span class="accented">rosh</span>, that which is highest; either principal waters, arms or branches (Taylor Lewis, Alford), or beginnings of rivers, indicating the sources of the streams (Gesenius, Keil, Macdonald, Murphy). If the second of these interpretations be adopted, Eden must be looked for in a spot where some great flowing water is subdivided into four separate streams; if the former be regarded as the proper exegesis, then any great river which is first formed by the junction of two streams, and afterwards disperses its waters in two different directions, will meet the requirements of the case. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison: that <i>is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there is</i> gold;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The name of the first</span> (river is) <span class="cmt_word">Pishon</span>, or "the full-flowing."

Now among the sons of Joktan or primitive Arabs (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>) - "whose dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest, unto Sephar, a mount of the east" - are Ophir and Havilah, whence Gesenius concludes that India, including Arabia, is meant. Other countries have their advocates, such as Arabia Felix, Susiana, Colchis, &c.; and other rivers, such as the Ganges (Josephus, Eusebius), the Phasis (Reland, Jahn, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Winer), the Indus (Schulthess, Kalisch).

Under the impression that the African Cush was meant, the Alexandrine Jews discovered the Gihon in the Nile - an opinion in which they have been followed by Schulthess, Gesenius, Furst, Bertheau, Kalisch, and others. But Cush, it is now known, describes the entire region between Arabia and the Nile, and in particular the southern district of the former lying between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Hence Tayler Lewis finds the Gihon in the ocean water sweeping round the south coast of Arabia. Murphy detects the name Kush in the words Caucasus and Caspian, and, looking for the site of Eden about the sources of the Euphrates and the Tigris in Armenia, thinks the Gihon may have been the leading stream flowing into the Caspian. Delitzsch advocates the claim of the Araxis to be this river.

Further description of this great water was unnecessary, being universally known to the Hebrews as "the great river" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>), and "the river" <span class="accented">par excellence</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>). The river still bears its early name. In the cuneiform inscriptions deciphered by Rawlinson it is called "Ufrata." Recurring now to the site of Eden, it must be admitted that, notwithstanding this description, the whole question is involved in uncertainty. The two solutions of the problem that have the greatest claim on our attention are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which places Eden near the head of the Persian Gulf, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that which looks for it in Armenia. The latter is favored by the close proximity to that region of the sources of both the Euphrates and the Tigris; but, on the other hand, it is hampered by the difficulty of discovering other two rivers that will correspond with the Gihon and the Pison, and the almost certainty that Cush and Havilah are to be sought for in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf. The former (Calvin, Kalisch, T. Lewis) is supported by this last consideration, that Cush and Havilah are not remote from the locality, though it too has its encumbrances. It seems to reverse the idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, which according to Le Clerc indicates the direction of the stream. Then its advocates, no more than the supporters of the alternate theory, are agreed upon the Gihon and the Pison: Calvin finding them in the two principal mouths of the Euphrates and the Tigris, which Sir Charles Lyell declares to be of comparatively recent formation; Kalisch identifying them with the Indus and the Nile; and Taylor Lewis regarding them as the two sides of the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Rawlinson, from a study of the Assyrian texts, has pointed out the coincidence of the Babylonian region of Karduniyas or Garduniyas with the Eden of the Bible; and the late George Smith finds in its four rivers, Euphrates, Tigris, Surappi, and Ukui, its known fertility, and its name, Gandunu, so similar to Ganeden (the garden of Eden), "considerations all tending towards the view that it is the paradise of Genesis" ('Chald.

This would almost seem to hint that the <span class="accented">aurea aetas</span> of classical poetry was but a dream - a reminiscence of Eden, perhaps, but idealized.

Doubtless there is here too an ominous hint of the existence of that greater adversary against whom he was appointed to watch. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehovah Elohim commanded the man</span> (Adam), <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. Whether or not these were the first words listened to by man (Murphy), they clearly presuppose the person to whom they were addressed to have had the power of understanding language, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of interpreting vocal sounds, and representing to his own mind the conceptions or ideas of which they were the signs, a degree of intellectual development altogether incompatible with modern evolution theories. They likewise assume the pre-existence of a moral nature which could recognize the distinction between "<span class="accented">thou</span> shalt" and "<span class="accented">thou</span> shalt not." <span class="cmt_word">Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat</span>; literally, eating, thou shalt eat. Adam, it thus appears, was permitted to partake of the tree of life; not, however, as a means of either conferring or preserving immortality, which was already his by Divine gift, and the only method of conserving which recognized by the narrative was abstaining from the tree of knowledge; but as a symbol and guarantee of that immortality with which he had been endowed, and which would continue to be his so long as he maintained his personal integrity. This, of course, by the very terms of his existence, he was under obligation to do, apart altogether from any specific enactment which God might enjoin. As a moral being, he had the law written on his conscience. But, as if to give a visible embodiment to that law, and at the same time to test his allegiance to his Maker's will, which is the kernel of all true obedience, an injunction was laid upon him of a positive description - <span class="cmt_word">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</span>. Speculations as to what kind of tree it was, whether a vine, a fig, or an apple tree, are more curious than profitable. There is no reason to suppose that any noxious or lethiferous properties resided in its fruit. The death that was to follow on transgression was to spring from the <span class="accented">eating</span>, and not from the fruit; from the sinful act, and not from the creature, which in itself was good. The prohibition laid on Adam was for the time being a summary of the Divine law. Hence the tree was a sign and symbol of what that law required. And in this, doubtless, lies the explanation of its name. It was a concrete representation of that fundamental distinction between right and wrong, duty and sin, which lies at the basis of all responsibility. It interpreted for the first pair those great moral intuitions which had been implanted in their natures, and by which it was intended they should regulate their lives. Thus it was for them a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It brought out that knowledge which they already possessed into the clear light of definite conviction and precept, connecting it at the same time with the Divine will as its source and with themselves as its end. Further, it was an intelligible declaration of the duty which that knowledge of good and evil imposed upon them. Through its penalty it likewise indicated both the good which would be reaped by obedience and the evil which would follow on transgression. <span class="cmt_word">For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</span>; literally, dying, thou shalt die. That this involved death physical, or the dissolution of the body, is indicated by the sentence pronounced on Adam after he had fallen (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). That the sentence was hot immediately executed does not disprove its reality. It only suggests that its suspension may have been due to some Divine interposition. Yet universal experience attests that permanent escape from its execution is impossible. In the case of Adam it was thus far put in force on the instant, that henceforth he ceased to be immortal. As prior to his fall his immortality was sure, being authenticated for him by the tree of life, so now, subsequent to that catastrophe, his mortality was certain. This, more than immediateness, is what the language implies. For the complete theological significance of this penalty see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God said, <i>It is</i> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - In anticipation of the ensuing narrative of the temptation and the fall, the historian, having depicted man's settlement in Eden, advances to complete his <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span> by the introduction upon the scene of the animals and woman. In the preliminary creation record (7-27) it is simply stated that God created man, male and female; there is a complete absence of details as to the Divine <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> in the execution of these, his last and greatest works. It is one object, among others, of the second portion of the history to supply those details. With regard to man (Adam), an account of his formation, at once minute and exhaustive, has been given in the preceding verses (7-17); now, with like attention to antecedent and concomitant circumstances and events, the sacred penman adds a description of the time, reason, manner, and result of the formation of woman. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone.</span> While the animals were produced either in swarms (as the fishes) or in pairs (as the birds and beasts), man was created as an individual; his partner, by a subsequent operation of creative power, being produced from himself. With the wild phantasies and gross speculations of some theosophists, as to whether, prior to the creation of Eve, Adam was androgynic (Bohme), or simply <span class="accented">vir</span> in <span class="accented">potentia</span>, out of which state he passed the moment the woman stood by his side (Ziegler), a devout exegesis is not required to intermeddle. Neither is it needful to wonder how God should pronounce that to be not good which he had previously (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) affirmed was good. The Divine judgment of which the preceding chapter speaks was expressed at the completion of man's creation; this, while that creation was in progress. For the new-made man to have been left without a partner would, in the estimation of Jehovah Elohim, have been for him a condition of being which, if not necessarily bad in itself, yet, considering his intellectual and social nature, "would eventually have passed over from the negative not good, or a manifest want, into the positive not good, or a hurtful impropriety"' (Lange). "It was not good for man to be alone; not, as certain foolish Rabbis conceited, lest he should imagine himself to be the lord of the world, or as though no man could live without a woman, which is contrary to Scripture; but in respect of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual society and comfort, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the propagation of the race, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the increase and generation of the Church of God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the promised seed of the woman (Willet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly, Jehovah Elohim, for whom (seeing that his nature is to dispense happiness to his creatures) no more than for Adam would it have been good that man, being what he <span class="accented">was</span>, should remain alone, said, <span class="cmt_word">I will provide a help meet for him</span>; literally, an helper, as over against him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corresponding to him, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; ver. 20, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, LXX. The expression indicates that the forthcoming helper was to be of similar nature to the man himself, corresponding by way of supplement to the incompleteness of his lonely being, and in every way adapted to be his co-partner and companion. All that Adam's nature demanded for its completion, physically, intellectually, socially, was to be included in this <span class="accented">altera ego</span> who was soon to stand by his side. Thus in man s need, and woman's power to satisfy that need, is laid the foundation for the Divine institution of marriage, which was afterwards prescribed not for the first pair alone, but for all their posterity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <i>them</i> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <i>was</i> the name thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air.</span> To allege that the Creator's purpose to provide a helpmeet for Adam seeks realization through the production of the animals (Kalisch, Alford) proceeds upon a misapprehension of the proper nexus which binds the thoughts of the historian, and a want of attention to the peculiar structure of Hebrew composition, besides exhibiting Jehovah Elohim in the character of an empiric who only tentatively discovers the sort of partner that is suitable for man. It is not the time, but simply the fact, of the creation of the animals that the historian records. The <span class="accented">Vav</span>. consec. does not necessarily involve time-succession, but is frequently employed to indicate thought-sequence (cf. 2:8; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13</a>, &c.). The verb (pret.) may also quite legitimately be rendered "had formed (Bush). "Our modern style of expressing the Semitic writer's thought would be this - 'And God brought to Adam the beasts which he had formed (Delitzsch). It is thus unnecessary to defend the record from a charge of inconsistency with the previous section, by supposing this to be the account of a second creation of animals in the district of Eden. Another so-called contradiction, that the present narrative takes no account of the creation of aquatic animals, is disposed of by observing that the writer only notices that those animals which were brought to Adam had been previously formed by God from the ground, and were thus in the line of the onward evolutions of the heavens and the earth which led up to mare As to why the fishes were not brought into the garden, if other reason is required besides that of physical impossibility, the ingenuity of Keil suggests that these were not so nearly related to Adam as the fowls and the beasts, which, besides, were the animals specially ordained for his service. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them</span> (literally, brought; not necessarily all the animals in Eden, but specimens of them) unto <span class="cmt_word">Adam</span>. We agree with Willet in believing that "neither did Adam gather together the cattle as a shepherd doth his sheep, nor did the angels muster them, nor the animals come themselves, and, passing by, while he sat on some elevation, bow their heads at his resplendent appearance; nor were Adam's eyes so illuminate that he beheld them all in their places - all which," says he, "are but men's conceits; but that through the secret influence of God upon their natures they were assembled round the inmate of paradise, as afterwards they were collected in the ark. The reasons for this particular action on the part of God were manifold; one of them being stated in the words which follow - <span class="cmt_word">to see what he would call them</span>; literally, to them. Already man had received from God his first lesson in the exercise of speech, in the naming of the trees and the imposition of the prohibition. This was his second - the opportunity afforded him of using for himself that gift of language and reason with which he had been endowed. In this it is implied that man was created with the faculty of speech, the distinct gift of articulate and rational utterance, and the capacity of attaching words to ideas, though it also seems to infer that the evolution of a language was for him, as it is for the individual yet, a matter of gradual development. Another reason was to manifest his sovereignty or lordship over the inferior creation. <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever Adam</span> (literally, the man) <span class="cmt_word">called every living creature</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> that was brought to him), <span class="cmt_word">that was the name thereof.</span> That is to say, it not only met the Divine approbation as exactly suitable to the nature of the creature, and thus was a striking attestation of the intelligence and wisdom of the first man, but it likewise adhered to the creature as a name which had been assigned by its master.

Speech and language both spring full-formed, though not completely matured, from the <span class="accented">primus</span> homo of the Bible. As to the names that Adam gave the animals, with Calvin we need not doubt that they were founded on the best of reasons, though what they were it is impossible to discover, as it is not absolutely certain that Adam spoke in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</span> This was the chief reason for assembling the creatures. It was meant to reveal his loneliness. The longing for a partner was already deeply seated in his nature, and the survey of the animals, coming to him probably in pairs, could not fail to intensify that secret hunger of his soul, and perhaps evoke it into conscious operation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept.</span> This was clearly not a sleep of weariness or fatigue, in consequence of arduous labors undergone, but a supernatural slumber, which, however, may have been superinduced upon the natural condition of repose. Lightfoot, following the LXX. who translate <span class="accented">tardemah</span> (deep sleep) by <span class="accented">ecstasy</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, imagines that the whole scene of Eve's creation was presented to Adam's imagination in a Divinely-inspired dream, which has at least the countenance of <a href="../../par/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a> Such a supposition, however, is not required to account for Adam's recognition of his bride. There is more of aptness in the observation of Lange, that in the deep sleep of Adam we have an echo of the area-tire evenings that preceded the Divine activity. "Everything out of which some new thing is to come sinks down before the event into such a deep sleep, is the farseeing and comprehensive remark of Ziegler. <span class="cmt_word">And he took one of his ribs</span> (<span class="accented">tsela</span>   =   something bent, from <span class="accented">tesala</span>, to incline; hence a rib), <span class="cmt_word">and closed up the flesh</span> (literally, flesh) <span class="cmt_word">instead thereof</span>. Whether Adam was created with a superfluous rib, or his body was mutilated by the abstraction of a rib, is a question for the curious. In the first, Calvin finds nothing "which is not in accordance with Divine providence," while he favors the latter conjecture, and thinks that Adam got a rich compensation - "quum se integrum vidit in uxore, qui prius tantum dimidius erat." Luther inclines to think that Adam's language in ver. 23 implies that not the bare rib, but the rib with the accompanying flesh, was extracted.

The peculiar phraseology employed to describe the formation of Adam s partner has been understood as referring to the physical configuration of woman s body, which is broadest towards the middle (Lyra); to the incompleteness of Adam's being, which was like an unfinished building until Eve was formed (Calvin); to the part of the female in building up the family (Delitzsch, Macdonald), to the building up of the Church, of which she was designed to be a type (Bonar); - yet it may be doubted if there is not as much truth in the remark that "by the many words used in the generation of mankind, as <span class="accented">creating</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), <span class="accented">making</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>), forming and <span class="accented">inspiring</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), and now <span class="accented">building</span>, Moses would set forth this wondrous workmanship for which the Psalmist so laudeth God," <a href="../../par/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a> (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And brought her unto the man.</span> I.e. led, conducted, and presented her to Adam.

"The thrice repeated <span class="accented">this is</span> characteristic.

"They were naked, but yet they were not so. Their bodies were the clothing of their internal glory; and their internal glory was the clothing of their nakedness" (Delitzsch). It is not surprising that the primeval history of mankind should have left its impress upon the current of tradition. The Assyrian tablets that relate to man are so fragmentary and mutilated that they can scarcely be rendered intelligible. So far as they have been deciphered, the first appears on its obverse side "to give the speech of the Deity to the newly-created pair (man and woman), instructing them in their duties," in which can be detected a reference' to something which is eaten by the stomach, to the duty of daily invocation of the Deity, to the danger of leaving God's fear, in which alone they can be holy, and to the propriety of trusting only a friend; and on its reverse what resembles a discourse to the first woman on her duties, in which occur the words, "With the lord of thy beauty thou shalt be faithful: to do evil thou shalt not approach him" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 78-80). The Persian legend describes Meschia and Meschiane, the first parents of our race, as living in purity and innocence, and in the enjoyment of happiness which Ormuzd promised to render perpetual if they persevered in virtue. But Ahriman, an evil demon (Dev), suddenly appeared in the form of a serpent, and gave them of the fruit of a wonderful tree. The literature of the Hin-does distinguishes four ages of the world, in the first of which Justice, in the form of a bull, kept herself firm on her four feet; when Virtue reigned, no good which the mortals possessed was mixed with baseness, and man, free from disease, saw all his wishes accomplished, and attained an age of 400 years. The Chinese also have their age of happy men, living in abundance of food, and surrounded by the peaceful beasts ('Kalisch on Genesis,' p. 87). In the Zendavesta, Yima, the first Iranic king, lives in a secluded spot, where he and his people enjoy uninterrupted happiness, in a region free from sin, folly, violence, poverty, deformity. The Teutonic Eddas have a glimpse of the same truth in their magnificent drinking halls, glittering with burnished gold, where the primeval race enjoyed a life of perpetual festivity. Traces of a similar belief are found among the Thibetans, Mongolians, Cingalese, and others (Rawlinson's 'Hist. Illustrations of Scripture,' p. 10). The Western traditions are familiar to scholars in the pages of Hesiod, who speaks of the golden age when men were like the gods, free from labors, troubles, cares, and all evils in general; when the earth yielded her fruits spontaneously, and when men were beloved by the gods, with whom they held uninterrupted communion (Hesiod, 'Opera et Dies,' 90). And of Ovid, who adds to this picture the element of moral goodness as a characteristic of the <span class="accented">aurea aetas</span> ('Metam.,' 1:89). Macrobius ('Somn. Scipionis,' 2:10) also depicts this period as one in which reigned <span class="accented">simplicitas mali nescia et adhuc astutiae inexperta</span> (Maedonald, 'Creation and the Fall,' p. 147). "<span class="accented">These</span> coincidences affect the originality of the Hebrew writings as little as the frequent resemblance of Mosaic and heathen laws.

If not warranted to infer that Rachel s barrenness was due to lack of prayer on her part and Jacob s (Keil), we are at least justified in asserting that her conduct in breaking forth into angry reproaches against her husband was unlike that of Jacob's mother, Rebekah, who, in similar circumstances, sought relief in prayer and oracles (Kalisch). The brief period that had elapsed since Rachel's marriage, in comparison with the twenty years of Rebekah's barrenness, signally discovered Rachel's sinful impatience.

The six sons of Leah might be born in the seven years, allowing one year's complete cessation from pregnancy, viz., the fifth; Bilhah's in the third and fourth years; Zilpah's in the beginning of the sixth and seventh; and Rachel's toward the end of the seventh, leaving Dinah to be born later (cf.

If, therefore, the assertion now made to his wives was not an unblushing falsehood, Jacob could not have been the monster of craft and deception depicted by some (Kalisch); while, if it was, it must have required considerable effrontery to appeal to his wives' knowledge for a confirmation of what they knew to be a deliberate untruth. The hypothesis that Jacob first acquired his great wealth by "consummate cunning," and then piously "abused the authority of God in covering or justifying them" (Kalisch), presupposes on the part of Jacob a degree of wickedness inconceivable in one who had enjoyed the sublime theophany of Bethel.

Since all the parti-colored animals had already been removed (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>), this vision must have been intended to assure him that the flocks would produce speckled and spotted progeny all the same as if the ringstraked and grisled rams and he-goats had not been removed from their midst (cf. Kurtz, &sect; 78). To insist upon a contradiction between this account of the increase of Jacob's flocks and that mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a> is to forget that both may be true. Equally arbitrary does it seem to be to accuse Jacob of fraud in adopting the artifice of the pilled rods (Kalisch). Without resorting to the supposition that he acted under God s guidance (Wordsworth), we may believe that the dream suggested the expedient referred to, in which some see Jacob's unbelief and impatience (Kurtz, Gosman in Lange), and others a praiseworthy instance of self-help (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee</span>. If the preceding clause appears to imply that the vision was sent to Jacob at the beginning of the six years' service, the present clause scents to point to the end of that period as the date of its occurrence; in which case it would require to be understood as a Divine intimation to Jacob that his immense wealth was not to be ascribed to the success of his own stratagem, but to the blessing of God (Delitzsch). The difficulty of harmonizing the two views has led to the suggestion that Jacob here mixes the accounts of two different visions accorded to him, at the commencement and at the close of the period of servitude (Nachmanides, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kurtz,- ' Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish).

Whether Jacob's absence from the festivities is to be explained by the dissension existing between him and Laban, which either caused him to be uninvited or led him to decline the invitation (Kurtz), or by the supposition that he had first gone and subsequently left the banquet (Lange), the fact that Laban was so engaged afforded Jacob the opportunity he desired for making his escape. <span class="cmt_word">And Rachel had stolen</span> (or, "<span class="accented">and</span> Rachel <span class="accented">stole</span>," availing herself likewise of the opportunity presented by her father's absence) <span class="cmt_word">the images that were her father's.</span> The teraphim, from an unused root, <span class="accented">taraph</span>, signifying to live comfortably, like the Sanscrit <span class="accented">trip</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Arabic tarafa (Gesenius, Furst, <span class="accented">sub voces</span>), appear to have been small human figures (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>), though the image in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a> must have been nearly life-size, or at least a full-sized bust, sometimes made of silver (<a href="../../par/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>), though commonly constructed of wood (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13-16</a>); they were worshipped as gods (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">vide</span>, Vulgate, cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>), consulted for oracles (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), and believed to be the custodians and promoters of human happiness (<a href="../../par/judges/18-24.htm">Judges 18:24</a>). Probably derived from the Aramaeans (Furst, Kurtz), or the Chaldeans (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, Kalisch, Wordsworth), the worship of teraphim was subsequently denounced as idolatrous (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-24.htm">2 Kings 13:24</a>).

Rachel's motive for abstracting her father's teraphim has been variously ascribed to a desire to prevent her father from discovering, by inquiring at his gods, the direction of their flight (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller), to protect herself, in case, of being overtaken, by an appeal to her father s gods (Josephus), to draw her father from the practice of idolatry (Bazil, Gregory, Nazisnzen, Theodoret), to obtain children for herself through their assistance (Lengerke, Gerlach), to preserve a memorial of her ancestors, whose pictures these teraphim were (Lightfoot); but was probably due to avarice, if the images were made of precious metals (Pererius), or to a taint of superstition which still adhered to her otherwise religious nature (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary ), causing her to look to these idols for protection (Kalisch, Murphy) or consultation (Wordsworth) on her journey.

Another instance of this play upon the sound and sense is to be found in vers. 19, 20 - "Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's; and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Syrian" (cf. Quarry on Genesis, p. 498) - <span class="cmt_word">spake unto me yester night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob</span> - literally, <span class="accented">guard or keep thee for thyself</span> (the pleon, pron. being added <span class="accented">ut supra</span>, ver. 24) <span class="accented">from speaking with Jacob - <span class="cmt_word"></span>either good or bad</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone</span> (literally, <span class="accented">going thou didst go -</span> thou hast indeed gone), <span class="cmt_word">because thou sore longedst after thy father's house</span> (literally, <span class="accented">because desiring thou didst desire</span>.

Augustine calls attention to this as the first Scripture reference to heathen gods, and Calvin probably supplies the right explanation of the sense in which they were so styled by Laban, <span class="accented">non quia deitatem illie putaret esse inclusam</span>, <span class="accented">sed quia in honorem deorum imagines illas colebat</span>; <span class="accented">vel potius quod Deo sacra facturus</span>, <span class="accented">vertebat se ad illas imagines</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>).

The woman's riding-saddle was commonly made of wicker-work and had the appearance of a basket or cradle. It was usually covered with carpet, and protected against wind, rain, and sun by means of a canopy and curtains, while light was admitted by openings in the side (cf. Gesenius, sub <span class="accented">voce</span>; Kalisch <span class="accented">in loco</span>).

That, prior to the law, this particular statute concerning women was in force among the Aramaeans appears from the present instance; and that it was not exclusively Jewish, but shared in by other nations of antiquity, is the opinion of the best authorities (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kurtz, 'History of the Old Covenant,' &sect; 79; 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 213; Keil <span class="accented">in loco</span>; both of whom quote Bahr's 'Symbolik of the Mosaic Cultus,' 2. 466).

"The night air at Joaiza was keen and cold; indeed there was a sharp frost, and ice appeared on all the little pools about the camp" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 364).

But, on the other hand, in favor of the accepted chronology it may be urged - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the interposition of a second twenty years in the middle of the first is unnatural; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, though legitimate, the proposed rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> does not at first sight suggest itself as that which Jacob intended; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it is not impossible for Jacob's family to have been born in the short space of seven years (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that in reality the difficulties connected with Judah and his sons are not removed by the hypothesis of a forty years' sojourn in Padan-aram any more than by a sojourn of only twenty years, since Judah must have married either after the sale of Joseph, in which case only twenty-two years remain for the birth and marriage of Er and Onan, for Pharez and Zarah, Judah's children by Tamar, to grow to manhood, and for Pharez to have two sons, Hezron and Hamul, before descending to Egypt, unless indeed, as Kurtz supposes, Judah's grandchildren were born in Egypt; or before the sale of Joseph - indeed, if Hezron and Hamul were born in Canaan, before the birth of Joseph, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. while Judah was yet in Padan-aram, which is contrary to the narrative (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1, 2</a>). For these reasons, though adopted by some excellent authorities (Bishop Horsley, Adam Clarke, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), the computation of Dr. Kennicott does not appear of sufficient weight to set aside the ordinary reckoning, which is followed by interpreters of equal credit (Keil, Kalisch, Kurtz, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast changed my wages ten times</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, if not, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unless, introducing the protasis of the sentence) t<span class="cmt_word">he God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the object of Isaac's fear, not "terror" (Oort and Kuenen, <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 243), viz.

The appearance of this invisible host may have been designed to celebrate Jacob's triumph over Laban, as after Christ's victory over Satan in the wilderness angels came and ministered unto him (Rupertus, Wordsworth), or to remind him that he owed his deliverance to Divine interposition (Calvin, Bush, Lange), but was more probably intended to assure him of protection in his approaching interview with Esau (Josephus, Chrysostom, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), and perhaps also to give him welcome in returning home again to Canaan (Kurtz), if not in addition to suggest that his descendants would require to fight for their inheritance (Kalisch).

Mahanaim, afterwards a distinguished city in the territory of Gad (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), and frequently referred to in subsequent Scripture (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>; 27; 19:32; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-14.htm">1 Kings 4:14</a>), as well as mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 7.9, 8), as a strong and beautiful city, has been identified with Mahneh, a deserted ruin six or seven miles north-west by north of Ajlun (Mount Gilead), and about twenty miles from the Jabbok (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Robinson,' vol. 3. App. 166; and cf. Tristram, 'The Land of Israel, p. 483); but the narrative appears to say that Mahanaim lay not north of Ga-leed, but between that place and Jabbok.

That he came with such a formidable force to meet his brother has been set down to personal vanity, or a desire to show how powerful a prince he had become (Lyra, Menochius); to fraternal kindness, which prompted him to do honor to his brother (Peele, Calvin, Clarke), to a distinctly hostile intention (Willet, Ainsworth, Candlish), at least if circumstances should seem to call for vengeance (Keil), though it is probable that Esau's mind, on first hearing of his brother's nearness, was simply excited, and "in that wavering state which the slightest incident might soothe into good will, or rouse into vengeance" (Murphy).

In Eastern countries the acceptance of a gift is equivalent to the striking of a covenant of friendship.

On the first hypothesis it is difficult to explain how Esau came to be traveling in the same direction as his brother, while the adoption of the second will serve in some measure to elucidate Jacob's language in ver. 2.

but it does not follow that she was only six or seven years of age when the incident about to be described occurred (Tuch, Bohlen). If Jacob stayed two years at Succoth and eight in Shechem (Petavius), and if, as is probable, his residence in Shechem terminated with his daughter's dishonor (Lange), and if, moreover, Joseph s sale into Egypt happened soon after (Hengstenberg), Dinah may at this time have been in her sixteenth or seventeenth year (Kurtz). Yet there is no reason why she should not have been younger, say between thirteen and fifteen (Keil, Lange, Kalisch, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), since in the East females attain to puberty at the age of twelve, and sometimes earlier (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> - it is not implied that this was the first occasion on which Dinah left her mother's tent to mingle with the city maidens in Shechem: the expression is equivalent to "once upon a time she went <span class="accented">out"</span> (Hengstenberg) - <span class="cmt_word">to see the daughters of the land</span> - who were gathered at a festive entertainment (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:21, 1), a not improbable supposition (Kurtz), though the language rather indicates the paying of a friendly visit (Lange), or the habitual practice of associating with the Shechemite women (Bush), in their social entertainments, if not in their religious festivals.

Michaelis mentions an opinion still entertained in the East which explains the excessive indignation kindled in the breasts of Dinah's brothers, vie., that "in those countries it is thought that a brother is more dishonored by the seduction of his sister than a man by the infidelity of his wife; for, say the Arabs, a man may divorce his wife, and then she is no longer his; while a sister and daughter remain always sister and daughter" (vide Kurtz, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' (82) - <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shechem) - <span class="cmt_word">had wrought folly</span>. - the term <span class="accented">folly</span> easily passes into the idea of wickedness of a shameful character (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-12.htm">2 Samuel 13:12</a>), since from the standpoint of Scripture sin is the height of unreason (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-22.htm">Psalm 74:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>), and holiness the sublimest act of wisdom (<a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) - in (or against) <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> - the word, here applied for the first time to Jacob's household, afterwards became the usual national designation of Jacob's descendants; and the phrase here employed for the first time afterwards passed into a standing expression for acts done against the sacred character which belonged to Israel as a separated and covenanted community, especially for sins of the flesh (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>), but also for other crimes (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">in lying with Jacob's daughter</span>.

Assigned to the historian ('Speaker's Commentary'), or to the hand of a late redactor (Davidson, Colenso, Alford), there is no reason why these words should not have been spoken by Jacob's sons (Keil, Murphy, and others)' to indicate their sense of the new and higher morality that had come in with the name of Israel (Lange).

The difference between this account and that previously given (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-9.htm">Genesis 28:9</a>) will appear at a glance by setting the two lists of wives in parallel columns: - 1. Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite. 1. Aholibamah, daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite. 2. Bashemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite. 2. Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite. 3. Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth. 3. Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. The two lists agree in saying <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Esau had three wives, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that one of them was the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that another of them was Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebajoth, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that the name of one of them was Bashemath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The discrepancy between the two is greatest in respect of the first wife, who appears with a different name and a different parentage in the two lists; while with reference to the second and the third wives, it is only the difference of name that requires to be accounted for. Now since the two lists belong to the so-called Elohistic document (Tuch, Bleak, Stahelin, Davidson, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), the hypothesis must be discarded "that the Hebrew text, though containing several important coincidences, evidently embodies two accounts irreconcilably different" (Kalisch) - a conclusion which can only be maintained by ascribing to the author the most absolute literary incompetence. Equally the conjecture must be set aside that the two lists refer to different persons, the second three being names of wives which Esau took on the decease of the first. The solutions that appear most entitled to acceptance, though all are more or less conjectural, proceed upon the supposition that Esau had only three wives, or at most four. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> On the hypothesis that Esau had not more than three wives, it is only needful to presume that each of them had two names, a not unusual circumstance in Oriental countries (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick) - one of them, probably that contained in the present list, bestowed on the occasion of marriage; and that Anah, the father of Aholibamah, was the same person with Beeri, or the Well-Man, who received that cognomen from the incident related in ver. 24, viz., that he discovered certain hot springs while feeding his father's asses (Hengstenberg, Keil, Kurtz) - the peculiarity that in one place (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>) he is styled a Hittite, in another (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>) a Hivite, and in a third (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>) a Horite, being explained by the conjecture that the first was the generic term for the race, the second the specific designation of the tribe, and the third the particular name for the inhabitants of the district to which he belonged (Keil, Lange, 'Speaker s Commentary). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Another solution gives to Esau four wives, by supposing Judith to have died without issue (Murphy, Jacobus), or, in consequence of being childless, though still living, to have been passed over in silence in the former genealogical register (Quarry), and Aholibamah to have been the fourth partner whom Esau espoused. The Samaritan version reads Mahalath for Bashemath in the second list, which it regards as an error of transcription (W. L. Alexander in Kitto's ' Cyclopedia'); while others think that Adah has been written by inadvertence for Bashemath (Inglis)'; but such conjectures are as unnecessary as they are manifestly arbitrary.

'The whole of the captives are clad in parti-colored garments, and the tunic of this individual in particular may be called "a coat of many colors" (Thornlcy Smith, 'Joseph and his Times,' p. 12). It has been supposed that Jacob's object in conferring this distinction on Joseph was to mark him out as the heir to whom the forfeited birthright of Reuben (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) was to be transferred (Kurtz, Lange, Gerlach, Bush, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary,' &c.); but the historian only mentions it as a token of affection, such as was customary in those times for princes to bestow upon their subjects, and parents on their children (vide Thornley Smith, 'Joseph and his Times,' p. 11).

It is apparent that Joseph understood this second dream, even more plainly than the first, to foreshadow, in some way unexplained, his future supremacy over his brethren, who were unmistakably pointed out by the eleven stars of the vision; and this remarkable coincidence between the number of the stars and the number of his brethren would facilitate the inference that his parents were referred to under the other symbols of the sun and moon. In the most ancient symbology, Oriental and Grecian as well as Biblical (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), it was customary to speak of noble personages, princes, &c., under such figures; and the employment of such terminology by a nomadic people like the Hebrew patriarchs, who constantly lived beneath the open sky, may almost be regarded as a water-mark attesting the historic credibility of this page at least of the sacred record (vide Havernick, 'Introd.,' &sect; 21), in opposition to Bohlen, who finds in the symbolical character of Joseph s dreams an evidence of their unreality, and De Wette, who explains them as the offspring of his aspiring mind.

The present chapter appears to interrupt the continuity of the narrative of Joseph's history. Partly on this account, and partly because the name Jehovah occurs in it (vers. 7, 10), it has been pronounced a later Jehovistic interpolation (Tuch, Bleek, Davidson, Coleuso). Its design has been explained as an attempt to glorify the line of David by representing it as sprung from Judah (Bohlen), or to disclose the origin of the Levitate law of marriage among the Jews (Knobel); but the incidents here recorded of Judah and his family are fitted to reflect dishonor instead of glory on the ancestry of David (Havernick); and the custom here mentioned of raising up seed to a dead brother by marrying his widow, though the idea may have originated with Judah (Lange), is more likely to have descended from earlier times (Delitzsch, Keil). Rightly understood, the object of the present portion of the record appears to have been not simply to prepare the way for the subsequent (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-27</a>) genealogical register (Gerlach), or to contrast the wickedness of Judah and his sons with the piety and chastity of Joseph in Egypt (Wordsworth), or to recite the private history of one of Christ's ancestors (Bush, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or to show that the pre-eminence of Judah in the patriarchal family was due exclusively to grace (Candlish), but also and chiefly to justify the Divine procedure in the subsequent deportation of Jacob and his sons to Egypt (Keil). The special danger to which the theocratic family was exposed was that of intermarrying with the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-6.htm">Genesis 28:6</a>). Accordingly, having carried forward his narrative to the point where, in consequence of Joseph's sale, a way begins to open up for the transference of the patriarchal house to the lend of the Pharaohs, the historian makes a pause to introduce a passage from the life of Judah, with the view of proving the necessity of such removal, by showing, as in the case of Judah, the almost certainty that, if left in Canaan, the descendants of Jacob would fall before the temptation of marrying with the daughters of the land, with the result, in the first instance, of a great and rapid moral deterioration in the holy seed, and with the ultimate effect of completely obliterating the line of demarcation between them and the surrounding heathen world. How the purity of the patriarchal family was guarded till it developed into a powerful nation, first by its providential withdrawment in infancy from the sphere of temptation (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-5.htm">Genesis 46:5</a>), then by its separate establishment in Goshen beside a people who regarded them with aversion (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>), and latterly by its cruel enslavement under Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>), is a subject which in due course engages the attention of the writer. <span class="cmt_word">At that time.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the date of Judah's marriage, as is most probable, was shortly after the sale of Joseph (Keil, Kurtz, Lange, Alford, Wordsworth, Quarry), since at the time of that atrocity Judah was still living with his brethren, the only difficulty calling for solution is to account for the birth of Judah's grandchildren, Hezron and Hamul (the sons of Pharez, the twin child of Judah by Tamar), in the short interval of twenty-two years which preceded Jacob's descent into Egypt without making Er and Onan marry in comparative boyhood. The case becomes a little less perplexing if Hezron and Hamul, though said to have come into Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>), may be regarded as having been born there (Hengstenberg), since twenty-two years afford sufficient space for the birth of Judah's three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah, which may have taken place during the first three years after their father's marriage, and for the birth of Pharez and Zarah, even if Er married as late as eighteen. Of course if the narrative requires the birth of Hezron and Hamul to have taken place in Canaan (Kalisch), it is simply impossible to hold that all this occurred within little more than a score of years. Hence <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the date of Judah's marriage has been placed before the sale of Joseph (Augustine, Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Drechsler, Baumgarten, Gerlach, Ainsworth, Candlish, Murphy, Inglis); but even on this assumption the task is arduous to make the birth of Hezron and Hamul occur before the emigration of their great-grandfather to Egypt. For as Judah was not more than four years older than Joseph (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a> with Genesis 30:25), his age at the time of Joseph's sale could not have been more than twenty-one. But placing Judah's marriage at the earliest possible date, viz., in his fifteenth year, only substitutes an interval of twenty-eight years instead of one of twenty-two, in which Judah's son Er must be born, grow up to manhood, (say at fifteen) marry, die, and leave his widow Tamar, who, after marrying with Onan and waiting for Shelah (which would consume at least another year), must become the mother of twin sons by her father-in-law (for which another year would be required), and must see the elder of the two married at ten years of age, if his sons are to be born upon the soft of Canaan. On either hypothesis, therefore, it seems indispensable to hold that Judah's grandsons were born in Egypt; and in this case there is little gained by putting Judah's marriage earlier than Joseph s sale, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Judah's twenty-first year. <span class="cmt_word">That Judah went down</span> - from Hebron (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>), or the mountains (Keil), towards the south (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller) <span class="cmt_word">from his brethren</span>, - setting up a separate and independent establishment apart from them; "not only immediately after Joseph was sold, but also on account of it," "in a fit of impenitent anger" (Kurtz), in a spirit of remorse (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">and turned in to a certain Adullamite</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">and pitched</span> (sc. his tent, <a href="../../par/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>) <span class="accented">up to, as</span> far as, or close by, a man, <span class="accented">an Adullamite, i.e.</span> belonging to Adullam, a town in the Hebron valley (Joshua 15:85); in the time of the conquest the seat of a Canaanitish king (<a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), afterwards celebrated for its connection with the history of David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>), subsequently mentioned in Scripture (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>), but never successfully identified (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607; Robinson, 2:175) - <span class="cmt_word">whose name was Hirah</span> - "Nobility" (Gesenius).

While the two are ploughing in the field, the elder sends the younger brother, who appears to have acted in the capacity of general superintendent, to fetch seed from the house. "And the younger brother found the wife of the elder sitting at her toilet.".... "And she spoke to him, saying, What strength there is in thee! Indeed I observe thy vigor every day. Her heart knew him She seized upon him, and said to him, Come, let us lie down for an instant. Better for thee...  beautiful clothes." "The youth became like a panther with fury on account of the shameful discourse which she had addressed to him. And she was alarmed exceedingly."...  "Her husband returned home at evening, according to his daily wont. He came to the house, and he found his wife lying as if murdered by a ruffian." Inquiring the reason of her distress, he is answered as Potiphar was answered by his deceitful spouse.

The present chapter relates the tragic incident which brought it to a termination. Into the question of the origin of moral evil in the universe it does not enter. The metaphysical problem of how the first thought of sin could arise in innocent beings it does not attempt to resolve. It seeks to explain the genesis of evil with reference to man. Nor even with regard to this does it aim at an exhaustive dissertation, but only at such a statement of its beginnings as shall demonstrate that God is not the author of sin, but that man, by his own free volition, brought his pristine state of purity and happiness to an end. A due regard to this, the specific object of the Mosaic narrative, will go far to answer not a few of the objections which have been taken to its historic credibility. Like the Mosaic record of creation, the Biblical story of the fall has been impugned on a variety of grounds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">doctrine</span> of a fall, which this chapter clearly teaches, has been assailed as inconsistent with the dictates of a speculative philosophy, if not also with the tenets of a Scriptural theology. While in the present narrative the origin of sin is distinctly traced back to the free volition of man acting without constraint, though not without temptation, in opposition to the Divine will, a more exact psychological analysis, it is alleged, declares it to have been from the first a necessity, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">metaphysically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being involved in the very conception of a finite will (Spinoza, Leibnitz, Baur); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">historically</span>, "<span class="accented">as</span> the expression of the necessary transition of the human race from the state of nature to that of culture" (Fichte, Kant, Schiller), or as developing itself in obedience to the law of antagonism and conflict (John Seotus Erigena, Hegel, Sehleiermacher, Schelling); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">theologically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> predetermined by a Divine decree (supralapsarianism). Without offering any separate refutation of these anti-Scriptural theories, it may suffice to say that in all questions affecting man's responsibility, the testimony of the individual consciousness, the ultimate ground of appeal, apart from revelation, affirms moral evil to be no all-controlling necessity, but the free product of the will of the creature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The <span class="accented">narrative</span> of the fall has been impugned - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> On the ground of its <span class="accented">miraculous character</span>.

But here the same remark will apply as was made in connection with the similarity alleged to exist between the Mosaic and heathen cosmogonies: it is immeasurably easier and more natural to account for the resemblance of Oriental legend to Biblical history, by supposing the former to be a traditional reflection of the latter, than it is to explain the unchallengable superiority of the latter to the former, even in a literary point of view, not to mention ethical aspects at all, by tracing both to a common source - the philosophic or theologic consciousness of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There are also those who, while neither repudiating it on the ground of miracle, nor discrediting it as a heathen myth, yet decline to accept it as other than a <span class="accented">parabolic</span> or allegorical narration of what transpired in the spiritual experience of the first pair.

It seems more correct to regard the epithet as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), and to hold that Moses, in referring to the subtlety of this creature, "does not so much point out a fault as attribute praise to nature" (Calvin), and describes qualities which in themselves were good, such as quickness of sight, swiftness of motion, activity of the self-preserving instinct, seemingly intelligent adaptation -of means to end, with perhaps a glance, in the use of '<span class="accented">arum</span>, at the sleekness of its glossy skin; but which were capable of being perverted to an unnatural use by the power and craft of a superior intelligence (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Than any</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was subtil more than any</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>beast of the field which the Lord God had made</span>. The comparison here instituted is commonly regarded as a proof that the tempter was a literal serpent, though Macdonald finds in the contrast between it and all other creatures, as well as in the ascription to it of pre-eminent subtlety, which is not now a characteristic of serpents, an intimation that the reptile was no creature of earth, or one that received its form from God," an opinion scarcely different from that of Cyril (100. Julian., lib. 3), that it was only the <span class="accented">simulacrum</span> of a serpent. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the curse pronounced upon the serpent (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>) would seem to be deprived of all force if the subject of it had been only an apparition or an unreal creature; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the language of the New Testament in referring to man's temptation implies its literality (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). "We are perfectly justified in concluding, from this mention of the fall, that Paul spoke of it as an actual occurrence" (Olshausen). Adam Clarke contends with much enthusiasm that the tempter was not a serpent, but an ape or orangutan. <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>. Not as originally endowed with speech (Josephus, Clarke), or gifted at this particular time with the power of articulation ('Ephrem., lib. de paradiso,' c. 27, quoted by Willet), but simply as used by the devil (Augustine, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), who from this circumstance is commonly styled in Scripture '<span class="accented">The</span> serpent," "the old serpent," "that old serpent" (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>). Nor is it more difficult to understand the speaking of the serpent when possessed by Satan, than the talking of Balaam s ass when the Lord opened its mouth (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28-30</a>). Equally with the idea that the devil was the only agent in man s temptation, and that the serpent is purely the allegorical dress in which the historian clothes him (Eusebius, Cajetan, Quarry, Alford), must the notion be rejected that there was nothing but a serpent (Aben Ezra, Kalisch, Knobel). Why, if there was an evil spirit manipulating the reptile, the historian did not say so has been explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on the ground that the belief in the devil was then foreign to the Hebrews (Knobel); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that up to this point in the narrative there is no mention of the devil (White of Dorchester); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Moses simply wished to <span class="accented">be rei gestae scriptor non interpres</span> (Pererins); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was unnecessary, those for whom he wrote being sufficiently capable of discerning that the serpent was not the prime mover in the transaction (Candlish); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> that "by a homely and uncultivated style he accommodates what he delivers to the capacity of the people" (Calvin); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> that his object being merely to show that God had no hand in man's temptation, but that Adam sinned of himself, it was not needful to do more than recite the incident as it appeared to the senses (White); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> that he wished "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid encouraging the disposition to transfer the blame to the evil spirit which tempted man, and thus reduce sin to a mere act of weakness" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the woman</span>. As the weaker of the two, and more likely to be easily persuaded (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-14.htm">1 Timothy 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). Cf. Satan's assault on Job through his wife (<a href="../../par/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>). Milton's idea that Eve desired to be independent, and had withdrawn herself out of Adam's sight, it has been well remarked, "<span class="accented">sets</span> up a beginning of the fall before the fall itself" (Lunge). <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span>.

The conversation may have been commenced by the tempter, and the question "thrown out as a feeler for some weak point where the fidelity of the woman might be shaken" (Murphy); but it is more likely that the devil spoke in continuation of a colloquy which is not reported (Kalisch, Macdonald), which has led some, on the supposition that already many arguments had been adduced to substantiate the Divine severity, to render "yea" by "<span class="accented">quanto magis</span>," as if the meaning were, "How much more is this a proof of God's unkindness!" (Aben Ezra, Kimchi). <span class="cmt_word">Hath God said</span>. "The tempter felt it necessary to change the living personal God into a merely general <span class="accented">numen divinum"</span> (Keil); but the Elohim of <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. He was not a mere <span class="accented">numen divinum</span> As much astray is the observation that Satan wished to avoid profaning the name of Jehovah (Knobel). Better is the remark that the serpent could not utter the name Jehovah as his assault was directed against the paradisiacal covenant of God with man (Lange). By using the name Elohim instead of Jehovah the covenant relationship of God towards man was obscured, and man's position in the garden represented as that of a subject rather than a son. As it were, Eve was first placed at the furthest distance possible from the supreme, and then assailed. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.</span> I.e. either accepting the present rendering as correct, which the Hebrew will bear, - "Are there any trees in the garden of which you may not eat?" "<span class="accented">Is</span> it really so that God hath prohibited you from some?" (Calvin), - or, translating <span class="accented">lo-kol</span> as <span class="accented">not</span> any - Latin, <span class="accented">nullus</span> (Gesenius, &sect; 152, 1) - "Hath God said ye shall not eat of any?" (Macdonald, Keil). According to the first the devil simply seeks to impeach the Divine goodness; according to the second he also aims at intensifying the Divine prohibition. The second rendering appears to be supported by the fitness of Eve's reply.

"There is nothing in the Chaldean fragments indicating a belief in the garden of Eden or the tree of knowledge; there is only an obscure allusion to a thirst for knowledge having been a cause of man's fall"... The details of the temptation are lost in the cuneiform text, which "opens where the gods are cursing the dragon and the Adam or man for his transgression."... "The dragon, which, in the Chaldean account, leads man to sin, is the creature of Tiamat, the living principle of the sea and of chaos, and he is an embodiment of the spirit of chaos or disorder which was opposed to the deities at the creation of the world." The dragon is in-eluded in the curse for the fall; and the gods invoke on the human race all the evils which afflict humanity - family quarrels, tyranny, the anger of the gods, disappointment, famine, useless prayers, trouble of mind and body, a tendency to sin ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 87-91). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">Persian</span>. For a time the first pair, Meschia and Mesehiane, were holy and happy, pure in word and deed, dwelling in a garden wherein was a tree whose fruit conferred life and immortality; but eventually Ahriman deceived them, and drew them away from Ormuzd. Emboldened by his success, the enemy again appeared, and gave them a fruit, of which they ate, with the result that, of the hundred blessings which they enjoyed, all disappeared save one. Falling beneath the power of the evil one, they practiced the mechanical arts, and subsequently built themselves houses and clothed themselves with skins. Another form of the legend represents Ahriman as a serpent. So close is the resemblance of this legend to the Scriptural account, that Rawlinson regards it not as a primitive tradition, but rather as "<span class="accented">an</span> infiltration into the Persian system of religious ideas belonging properly to the Hebrews" ('Hist.

The fourth opinion seems most accordant with the language of the malediction. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art cursed</span>. The cursing of the irrational creature should occasion no more difficulty than the cursing of the earth (ver. 17), or of the fig tree (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). Creatures can be cursed or blessed only in accordance with their natures. The reptile, therefore, being neither a moral nor responsible creature, could not be cursed in the sense of being made susceptible of misery. But it might be cursed in the sense of being deteriorated in its nature, and, as it were, consigned to a lower position in the scale of being. And as the Creator has a perfect right to assign to his creature the specific place it shall occupy, and function it shall subserve, in creation, the remanding of the reptile to an inferior position could not justly be construed into a violation of the principles of right, while it might serve to God's intelligent creatures as a visible symbol of his displeasure against sin (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28-36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Above</span>.

"As the worm steals over the earth with its length of body," "as a mean and despised crawler in the dust," having previously gone erect (Luther), and been possessed of bone (Josephus), and capable of standing upright and twining itself round the trees (Lange), or at least having undergone some transformation as to external form (Delitzsch, Keil); though the language may import nothing more than that whereas the reptile had exalted itself against man, it was henceforth to be thrust back-into its proper rank," "recalled from its insolent motions to its accustomed mode of going," and "<span class="accented">at</span> the same time condemned to perpetual infamy" (Calvin). As applied to Satan this part of the curse proclaimed his further degradation in the scale of being in consequence of having tempted man. "Than the serpent trailing along the ground, no emblem can more aptly illustrate the character and condition of the apostate spirit who once occupied a place among the angels of God, but has been cast down to the earth, preparatory to his deeper plunge into the fiery lake (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; Macdonald). <span class="cmt_word">And dust shalt thou eat</span>, <span class="accented">I.e.</span> mingling dust with all it should eat.

More probably it originated in a too literal interpretation of the Mosaic narrative. Applied to the devil, this part of the curse was an additional intimation of his degradation. To "lick the dust" or "eat the dust" "<span class="accented">is</span> equivalent to being reduced to a condition of meanness, shame, and contempt" (Bush); "is indicative of disappointment in all the aims of being" (Murphy); "denotes the highest intensity of a moral condition, of which the feelings of the prodigal (<a href="../../par/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>) may be considered a type' (Macdonald; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of thy life</span>.

The hostility commenced between the woman and her destroyer was to be continued by their descendants - the seed of the serpent being those of Eve's posterity who should imbibe the devil's spirit and obey the devil's rule (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>); and the seed of the woman signifying those whose character and life should be of an opposite description, and in particular the Lord Jesus Christ, who is styled by preeminence "the Seed" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16, 19</a>), and who came "to destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).

The second idea is more fully explained in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">sons</span>, daughters being included. The pains of childbirth are in Scripture emblematic of the severest anguish both of body and mind (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-2.htm">Revelation 12:2</a>).

Following the LXX.

According to the analogy of the two previous clauses, the precise import of this is expressed in the next, though by many it is regarded as a distinct item in the curse (Kalisch, Alford, Clarke, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall rule over thee</span>. Not merely a prophecy of woman's subjection, but an investiture of man with supremacy over the woman; or rather a confirmation and perpetuation of that authority which had been assigned to the man at the creation. Woman had been given him as an helpmeet (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>), and her relation to the man from the first was constituted one of dependence. It was the reversal of this Divinely-established order that had led to the fall (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>). Henceforth, therefore, woman was to be relegated to, and fixed in, her proper sphere of subordination. On account of her subjection to man's authority a wife is described as the possessed or subjected one of a lord (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; Deuteronomy 20:22), and a husband as the lord of a woman (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-3.htm">Exodus 21:3</a>). Among the Hebrews the condition of the female sex was one of distinct subordination, though not of oppression, and certainly not of slavery, as it too often has been in heathen and Mohammedan countries. Christianity, while placing woman on the same platform with man as regards the blessings of the gospel (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), explicitly inculcates her subordination to the man in the relationship of marriage (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>)

In Adam's giving a second name to his wife has been discerned the first assertion of his sovereignty or lordship over woman to which he was promoted subsequent to the fall (Luther), though this seems to be negatived by the fact that Adam exercised the same prerogative immediately on her creation; an act of thoughtlessness on the part of Adam, in that, "being himself immersed in death, he should have called his wife by so proud a name" (Calvin); a proof of his incredulity (Rupertus).

This clearly pointed to the corn of the Nile valley, the <span class="accented">triticum compositum</span>, which Bears seven ears upon one stalk. The assertion of Herodotus, that the Egyptians counted it a disgrace to live on wheat and barley (2:36), Wilkinson regards as incorrect, since "both wheat and barley are noticed in Lower Egypt long before Herodotus' time (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>), and the paintings of the Thebaid prove that they were grown extensively in that part of the country; they were among the offerings in the temples; and the king, at his coronation, cutting some ears of wheat, afterwards offered to the gods as the staple production of Egypt, shows how great a value was set on a grain which Herodotus would lead us to suppose was held in abhorrence" (Rawlinson's 'Hexodotus,' vol. 2. p. 49).

Hengstenberg quotes Ukert as saying, "As long as the south-east wind continues, doors and windows are closed; but the fine dust penetrates everywhere; everything dries up; wooden vessels warp and crack. The thermometer rises suddenly from 16&deg; 20&deg;, up to 30&deg; 36&deg;, and even 38&deg;, Reaumur. This wind works destruction upon everything.

The character of Chnumhotep (a near relative and favorite of Osirtasen I., and his immediate successor), and the recorded events of his government, as described in the Beni-hassan monuments, also remind one of Joseph: - "he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Chnumhotep) injured no little child; he oppressed no widow; he detained for his own purpose no fisherman; took from his work no shepherd; no overseer's men were taken.

But in point of fact the inference was natural and reasonable that Joseph was no more, since twenty years had elapsed without any tidings of his welfare, and there was no absolute necessity requiring them to explain to the Egyptian governor all the particulars of their early life. Yet the circumstance that their assertion regarding himself was incorrect may have tended to awaken his suspicions concerning Benjamin.

Ostensibly in consequence of their unwillingness to agree to his proposal, but in reality to give them an experience of the suffering which they had inflicted on him, their brother, and so to awaken in their hearts a feeling of repentance. Yet the clemency of Joseph appears in this, that whereas he had lain three long years in prison as the result of their inhumanity towards him, he only inflicts on them a confinement of three days.

At the same time its use would arrest them more than the preceding adjuration, By the life of Pharaoh! and, whether or not it implied that the true God was not yet unknown in Egypt (Murphy), was clearly designed to show that he was a religious and conscientious person, who would on no account condemn them on mere suspicion (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison.</span> Joseph's first proposal, that one should go for Benjamin while nine remained as hostages for their good faith, is now reversed, and only one is required to be detained while the other nine return. If the severity of the first proposal filled them with consternation, the singular clemency of the second could not fail to impress them. Not only were the nine to be released, but their original demand for grain to carry home to Palestine was to be complied with, the grand vizier adding, to their undoubted amazement, <span class="accented">As for the rest of you, <span class="cmt_word"></span>go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses.</span> "How differently had they acted towards their brother, whom they had intended to leave in the pit to starve" (Keil).

That Joseph should have insisted on this stipulation, which he must have known would cause his aged father much anxiety and deep distress, is not to be explained as "almost designed" by Joseph as a chastisement on Jacob for his undue predilection in favor of Benjamin (Kalisch), but must be ascribed either to the intensity of his longing to see his brother (Murphy), or to a desire on his part to ascertain how his brethren were affected towards Benjamin (Lawson), or to a secret belief that the best mode of persuading his father to go down to him in Egypt was to bring Benjamin thither ('Speaker's Commentary'), or to an inward conviction that the temporary concern which Benjamin's absence might inflict on Jacob would be more than compensated for by the ultimate good which would thereby be secured to the whole family (Kurtz), or to the fact that God, under whose guidance throughout he acted, was unconsciously leading him in such a way as to secure the fulfillment of his dreams, which required the presence of both Benjamin and Jacob in Egypt (Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary). The reason which Joseph himself gave to his brethren was that Benjamin's presence was indispensable as a corroboration of their veracity. <span class="cmt_word">So</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die</span> (the death due to spies): <span class="cmt_word">And they did</span> <span class="cmt_word">so</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they consented to Joseph's proposal.

They had been guilty of many sins, but the special iniquity of which their reception by the Egyptian governor had reminded them was that which some twenty years before they had perpetrated against their own brother.

"Small pieces of gold or silver, together with precious stones, marked with strange figures and signs, were thrown into the vessel; after which certain incantations were pronounced, and the evil demon was invoked; the latter was then supposed to give the answer either by intelligible words, or by pointing to some of the characters on the precious stones, or in some other more mysterious manner. Sometimes the goblet was filled with pure water, upon which the sun was allowed to play; and the figures which were thus formed, or which a lively imagination fancied it saw, were interpreted as the desired omen" (Kalisch). Traces of this ancient practice of soothsaying have been detected by some writers in the magnificent vase of turquoise belonging to Jam-shoed, the Solomon of Persia. Like Merlin's cup, described by Spenser ('Faery Queens,' 3:2, 19) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"It vertue had to show in perfect sight<br />Whatever thing was in the world contained<br />Betwixt the lowest earth and heven's hight,<br />So that it to the looker appertaynd."</span> A similar account is given by Homer of the cup of Nestor; and Alexander the Great is reported to have possessed a mystic goblet of a like kind. It is said that in the storming of Seringapatam the unfortunate Tippeo Saib retired to gaze on his divining cup, and that after standing awhile absorbed in it he returned to the fight and fell (vide Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' art. Divination). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have done evil in so doing.</span>

For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever</span> (vide <a href="../../par/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, and now), <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman</span> (or servant) <span class="cmt_word">to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> "There was no duty that imperiously prohibited Judah from taking the place of his unfortunate brother. His children, and even his wife, if he had been in the married state, might have been sent to Egypt. He was so far master of his own liberty that he could warrantably put himself in Benjamin's room, if the governor gave his consent" (Lawson). <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall find</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my father</span>. The sublime heroism of this noble act of self-sacrifice on the part of Judah it is impossible to over-estimate. In behalf of one whom he knew was preferred to a higher place in his father's affection than himself, he was willing to renounce his liberty rather than see his aged parent die of a broken heart. The self-forgetful magnanimity of such an action has never been eclipsed, and seldom rivaled. After words so exquisitely beautiful and profoundly pathetic it was impossible for Joseph to doubt that a complete change had passed upon his brethren, and in particular upon Judah, since the day when he had eloquently urged, and they had wickedly consented, to sell their brother Joseph into Egypt. Everything was now ready for the denouement in this domestic drama. The story of Joseph's discovery of himself to his astonished brethren is related in the ensuing chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

It has been thought that the disrepute in which the shepherd guild was held by the Egyptians was attributable partly to the nature of their occupation, and partly to the feeling excited against them by the domination of the shepherd kings (Wilkinson, Wordsworth, Murphy, and others); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> while this might account for their dislike to foreign shepherds, it would not explain their antipathy to native shepherds; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if, as some think, Joseph's Pharaoh was one of the shepherd kings, it is not likely that this rooted prejudice against shepherds would then be publicly expressed, however violently it might afterwards explode; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> there is good reason for believing that the descent into Egypt occurred at a period much earlier than the shepherd kings. Hence the explanation of this singular antipathy to shepherds or wandering nomads has been sought in the fact that the Egyptians were essentially an agricultural people, who associated ideas of rudeness and barbarism with the very name of a shepherd (Hengstenberg, Keil, Kurtz), perhaps because from a very early period they had been exposed on their Eastern boundary to incursions from such nomadic shepherds (Rosenm&uuml;ller), and perhaps also because from their occupation shepherds were accustomed to kill the animals held sacred by the other classes of the community (Kalisch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Slave-owners are not usually content with a tax of only twenty percent on the gross revenues of their estates. Nor does it seem reasonable to allege that this was an exorbitant demand on the part either of Joseph or of Pharaoh. If in the seven years of plenty the people could afford to part with a fifth part of their produce, might not an improved system of agriculture enable them, under the new regulations, to pay as much as that in the shape of rent, and with quite as much ease? At all events the people themselves did not consider that they were being subjected to any harsh or unjust exaction.

Dr. Robinson quotes a modern parallel to this act of Joseph's, which both illustrates its nature and by way of contrast exhibits its clemency. Up to the middle of the present century the people of Egypt had been the owners as well as tillers of the soil. "By a single decree the Pasha (Mohammed Ali) declared himself to be the sole owner of all lands in Egypt; and the people of course became at once-only his tenants at will, or rather his slaves." "The modern Pharaoh made no exceptions, and stripped the mosques and other religious and charitable institutions of their landed endowments as mercilessly as the rest. Joseph gave the people seed to sow, and required for the king only a fifth of the produce, leaving four-fifths to them as their own; but now, though seed is in like manner given out, yet every village is compelled to cultivate two-thirds of its lands with corn and other articles for the Pasha, and also to render back to him, in the form of taxes and exactions in kind, a large proportion of the produce remaining after" ('Biblical Researches,' 1:42).

In this sense it was employed by Jacob (cf.  <a href="../../par/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a> with Genesis 49:18) and by Job (Job 19:21) to describe the Divine Rescuer who had delivered them from ill both temporal and spiritual, and who was to complete his emancipating work by ultimately ransoming them from the power of the grave.

It seems, however, better to regard the words as a prophetic utterance pointing forward to the conquest of Canaan, which Jacob here represents himself, in the persons of his descendants, as taking from the Amorites by means of sword and bow, and as intimating that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would receive a double portion of the inheritance, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> being probably designed to convey a hint that the tract to be in future assigned to Joseph's descendants would be the region round about the ancient city Shechem (Ainsworth, Keil, Kalisch, Lunge, &c.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/47.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 47"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 47" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/49.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 49"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 49" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

They had been confederate in their wickedness, they should in future, when returning to occupy their God. assigned inheritance, be disjoined. That this prediction was exactly fulfilled Scripture testifies. At the second census in the wilderness, shortly before the conquest, the tribe of Simeon had become so reduced in its numbers (reckoning only 22,000 as against 76,500 in Judah) as to be the smallest of the twelve (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>); to be passed over entirely in the last blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>.); to be accorded no independent allotment of territory in Canaan on the completion of the conquest, having only a few cities granted to it within the borders of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>); and to be ultimately absorbed in the more powerful and distinguished tribe under whose protection and tutelage, so to speak, it had been placed (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The tribe of Levi also was deprived of a separate inheritance, receiving only a number of cities scattered here and there among the possessions of their brethren (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1, 40</a>); and, though by its election to the priesthood the curse may be said to have been turned into a blessing, yet of this signal honor which was waiting Levi Jacob was completely silent, showing both that no prophecy was of any private interpretation (the seer seeing no further than the Holy Spirit helped him), and that Jacob spoke before the days of Moses. It is almost incredible that a late writer would have omitted to forecast the latter-day glory of the tribe of Levi; and this opinion is confirmed by observing the very different strain in which, after Levi s calling had been revealed, the benediction of Moses himself proceeds (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>).

Not only would Judah s soil be so fertile that its vines should be employed for trying asses and colts to their branches, but the grapes of those vines should be so plentiful and luscious as to make wine run like the water in which he washed his clothes, while the wine and milk should be so exhilarating and invigorating as to imp-art a sparkling brilliance to the eyes and a charming whiteness to the teeth.

It is doubtful if even the usual interpretation, that Jacob here expresses his hope and expectation that God would help and succor his descendants (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, and others), exhausts its rich significance. That, speaking in their name, he does anticipate the deliverance of Jehovah" In thy help do I hope, O Jehovah! - is apparent; but nothing surely can be more natural than to suppose that the dying patriarch, at the moment when he was formally transmitting to his children the theocratic blessing, had his thoughts lifted up towards that great salvation, of which all these material and temporal benedictions pronounced upon his sons were but the shadows and the types, and of which perhaps he had been incidentally reminded by the mention of the biting serpent, to which he had just likened Dan ('Speaker's Commentary'). It is noticeable that this is the first occurrence of the term salvation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>, from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, unused in Kal, to be roomy or spacious, hence in the Hiphil to set free or deliver).

In the appended clause he is represented as possessing in addition the capacity of "giving words of beauty," in which may be detected an allusion to the development in eloquence and song which afterwards took place in that northern tribe (<a href="../../par/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-1.htm">Judges 5:1-31</a>).

The structure of the clauses, the order of the words, the repetition of the thoughts, supply a glimpse into the fond emotion with which the aged prophet approached the blessing of his beloved son Joseph. Under the image of a fruit tree, probably a vine, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, planted by a well, whence it draws forth necessary moisture, and, sending forth its young twigs or offshoots over the supporting walls, he pictures the fruitfulness and prosperity which should afterwards attend the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, as the twofold representative of Joseph, with perhaps a backward glance at the service which Joseph had performed in Egypt by gathering up and dispensing the produce of the land for the salvation of his family and people. <span class="cmt_word">The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him</span> - literally, they <span class="accented">provoked him, and shot at, and laid snares for him, masters of arrows</span>, though Kalisch translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and they assembled in multitudes, which yields a sense sufficiently clear. It is sometimes alleged (Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary') that the words contain no allusion to the personal history of Joseph, but solely to the later fortunes of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh; but even if they do point to the subsequent hostilities which Joseph's descendants should incur (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4-6</a>), it is almost morally certain that the image of the shooting archers which he selects to depict their adversaries was suggested to his mind by the early lot of his beloved son (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Gerlach, Murphy, and others). <span class="cmt_word">But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</span> Notwithstanding the multitudinous and fierce assaults which had been made on Joseph, he had risen superior to his adversaries; his bow had continued firm and unbroken (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>), and his arms had been rendered active and flexible - neither <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX.), <span class="accented">dissoluta sunt vincula brachiorum et manuum</span> (Vulgate), as if Joseph s enemies were the subjects referred to; nor, "Therefore gold was placed upon his arms (Onkelos, Raehi, and others), referring to the gift of Pharaoh's ring - by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, i.e. God, who had proved himself to be Jacob's Mighty One by the powerful protection vouchsafed to his servant The title here ascribed to God occurs afterwards in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.</span> If the clause is parenthetical, it may signify either that from the time of Joseph's exaltation he became the shepherd (who sustained) and the stone of (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rock which supported) Israel (Oleaster); or that from God, the Mighty One of Jacob, Joseph received strength to become the shepherd and stone of Israel (Pererius, Ainsworth, Lawson, Patrick, and others), in which capacity he served as a prefiguration of the Good Shepherd who was also to become the Rock or Foundation of his Church (Calvin, Pererius, Candiish, &c.); but if the clause is rather co-ordinate with that which precedes and that which follows, as the introductory particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> appears to suggest, then the words "shepherd and stone of Israel" will apply to <span class="accented">God</span>, and the sentiment will be that the hands of Joseph were made strong from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, from there (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from there where is, or from him who is) the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Gerlach, Lange, <span class="accented">et alii</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from the</span> (<span class="accented">led of thy father, and he shall help thee</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who shall help thee); <span class="cmt_word">and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">with</span> (sc. the aid <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">the Almighty, and he shall bless</span> thee.

"From the God of Jacob, and by the help of the Almighty, should the rain and dew of heaven (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>), and fountains and brooks which spring from the great deep or the abyss of the earth, pour their fertilizing waters over Joseph's land, so that everything that had womb and breast should become pregnant, bring forth and suckle" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.</span> The meaning is, according to this rendering, which some adopt (the Targums, Vulgate, Syriac, Saadias, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), that the blessings which Jacob pronounced upon Joseph surpassed those which he himself had received from Abraham and Isaac, either as far as the primary mountains towered above the earth (Keil, Murphy), or, while exceeding the benedictions of his ancestors, those now delivered by himself would last while the hills endured (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'). But the words may be otherwise rendered: "The blessings of thy father prevail over, are mightier than the blessings of the mountains of eternity, the delight, or glory, or loveliness of the hills of eternity (LXX., Dathe, Michaelis, Gesenius, Bohlen, Kalisch, Gerlach, and others); and in favor of this may be adduced the beautiful parallelism between the last two clauses, which the received translation overlooks. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren</span> - literally, of <span class="accented">him, the separated</span> (from <span class="accented">nazar, to separate</span>) <span class="accented">from his brethren</span> (Onkelos, Rashi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, and others), though by some different renderings are preferred, as, e.g., the crowned among his brethren (LXX.

But whichever view be adopted of the construction of the language, it is obvious that Eve's utterance was the dictate of faith. In Cain's birth she recognized the earnest and guarantee of the promised seed, and in token of her faith gave her child a name (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-20.htm">Genesis 3:20</a>), which may also explain her use of the Divine name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> instead of <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, which she employed when conversing with the serpent. That Eve denominates her infant a man has been thought to indicate that she had previously borne daughters who had grown to womanhood, and that she expected her young and tender babe to reach maturity. Murphy thinks this opinion probable; but the impression conveyed, by the narrative is that Cain was the first-born of the human family.

Abel's sacrifice was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, fuller than Cain's; it had more in it; it had faith, which was wanting in the other. It was also offered in obedience to Divine prescription. The universal prevalence of sacrifice rather points to Divine prescription than to man's invention as its proper source. Had Divine worship been of purely human origin, it is almost certain that greater diversity would have prevailed in its forms. Besides, the fact that the mode of worship was not left to human ingenuity under the law, and that will-worship is specifically condemned under the Christian dispensation (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), favors the presumption that it was Divinely appointed from the first.

Because of the absence of those qualities which distinguished Abel and his offering; not because the heart of Cain was "no more pure," but "imbued with a criminal propensity" (Kalisch), which it was not until his offering was rejected. The visible sign, whatever it was, being awanting in the case of Cain's oblation, its absence left the offerer in no dubiety as to the Divine displeasure with both himself and his offering. In the rejection of Cain's offering Bohlen sees the animus of a Levitical narrator, who looks down slightingly on offerings of the fruits and flowers of earth; but, as Havernick well remarks, the theocracy was essentially based on agriculture, while the Mosaic institute distinctly recognized the legality and value of bloodless offerings. <span class="cmt_word">And Cain was very wroth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">it</span> <span class="accented">burned with Cain exceedingly</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and his countenance fell</span>.

There was apparently no sorrow for sin, "no spirit of inquiry, self-examination, prayer to God for light or pardon, clearly showing that Cain was far from a right state of mind" (Murphy). Yet the Lord does not forthwith abandon the contumacious and insensate transgressor, but patiently expostulates with and instructs him as to how he too might obtain the same blessing of acceptance which his younger brother enjoyed.

It is not against this that it argues too much moral goodness in Cain to suppose that he would tell his younger brother of Jehovah's admonition (Knobel); and it certainly relieves us from the necessity of adding to the moral turpitude of the unhappy fratricide by depicting him as deliberately planning his favored brother's murder, carrying the fell purpose within his guilty bosom, watching his opportunity (Bottcher and Knobel, who substitute <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> he <span class="accented">watched</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">he said</span>), and at last accomplishing his unhallowed purpose by means of treachery.

"Hence the prayer that the earth may net drink in the blood shed upon it, in order that it may not thereby become invisible and inaudible" (Knobel).

Thus the earth was made the minister of God's curse, not a partaker of it, as some have strangely imagined, as if by drinking up the blood of Abel it had become a participant of Cain's crime (Delitzsch).

Or, than can be borne away. Interpreted in either way, this is scarcely the language of confession, "sufficiens confessio, sod intempestiva" (Chrysostom); but, as the majority of interpreters are agreed, of desperation (Calvin). According to the first rendering Cain is understood as deploring not the enormity of his sin, but the severity of his punishment, under which he reels and staggers as one amazed (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Calvin, Keil, Delitzsch, Murphy, Alford, Speakers, Kalisch). According to the second, from the terrific nature of the blow which had descended on him Cain awakens to the conviction that his sin was too heinous to be forgiven (margin, Septuagint, Vulgate, Theodotion, Arabic, Syrlac, Onkelos, Samaritan, Gesenins, Wordsworth). The first of these is favored by the remaining portion of his address, which shows that that which had paralyzed his guilty spirit was not the wickedness of his deed, but the overwhelming retribution which had leapt so unexpectedly from its bosom. The real cause of his despair was the sentence which had gone forth against him, and the articles of which he now recapitulates. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou hast driven me this day</span> - "Out of the sentence of his own conscience Cain makes a clear, positive, Divine decree of banishment" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">from the face of the earth</span>.

Amongst the Gauls the excommunicated were deprived of any benefit of law (Caesar. 'de Bello Gallico,' 50:6; cf. also Sophocles, '(Edip. Tyrannus')" (Ainsworth). The apprehension which Cain cherished has been explained as an oversight on the part of the narrator (Schumann and Tuch); as a mistake on the part of Cain, who had no reason to know that the world was not populated (T. Lewis); as referring to the blood avengers of the future who might arise from his father's family (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch); and also, and perhaps with as much probability, as indicating that already, in the 130 years that had gone, Adam's descendants were not limited to the two brothers and their wives (Havernick).

In the case of Cain's murderer there was to be no such mitigation of the penalty as in the case of Cain himself; on the contrary, he would be visited more severely than Cain, as being guilty not alone of homicide, but of transgressing the Divine commandment which said that Cain was to live (Willet). As to why this special privilege was granted to Cain, it was not because "<span class="accented">the</span> early death of the pious Abel was in reality no punishment, but the highest boon (Kalisch), nor because banishment from God s presence was the greatest possible punishment, "having in itself the significance of a social human death" (Lange), nor because it was needful to spare life for the increase of posterity (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but perhaps  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To show that "<span class="accented">Vengeance</span> is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To prove the riches of the Divine clemency to sinful men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To serve as a warning against the crime of murder.

In support of the former it is urged that an external badge would be more likely to repel assailants; while in favor of the latter it is pleaded that of seventy-six times in which <span class="accented">oth</span> occurs in the Old Testament, in seventy-five it is translated <span class="accented">sign</span>. If there was a visible mark upon the fugitive, it is impossible to say what it was; that it was a shaking (LXX.), or a continual fleeing from place to place (Lyra), or a horn in the head (Rabbis), a peculiar kind of dress (Clericus), are mere conceits. But, whatever it was, it was not a sign of Cain's forgiveness (Josephus), only a pledge of God's protection; Cf. the Divine prophetic sentence against the Jewish Cain (<a href="../../par/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>).

Though afterwards forbidden, the tendency of Divine legislation on the subject of marriage being always in the direction of enlarging rather than restricting the circle of prohibited relationships, the union of brothers and sisters at the first was clearly indispensable, if the race was to multiply outwards from a common stock. "Even in much later times, and among very civilized nations, such alliances were not considered incestuous. The Athenian law made it compulsory to marry the sister if she had not found a husband at a certain age. Abraham married his half-sister, Sarah; and the legislator Moses himself was the offspring of-a matrimony which he later interdicted as unholy" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. For even from the unbelieving and unthankful, the disobedient and the repro. bate, God's providential mercies are not entirely withheld (<a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Enoch.</span> <span class="accented">Chanoch</span>, "dedicated," "initiated," from <span class="accented">chanach</span>, to instruct (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>) and to consecrate (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>). Candlish detects in the name the impious pride of the first murderer; with more charity, Keil and Kalisch see a promise of the renovation of his life. The latter thinks that Cain called his son "Initiated" or "Instructed" to intimate that he intended to instruct him from his early years in the duties of virtue, and his city "<span class="accented">Dedicated"</span> to signify that he now recognized that "the firstling of his social prosperity belongs to God." If Luther's conjecture be correct, that the child received its name from its mother, it will touchingly express that young mother's hope that the child whom God had sent might be an augury of blessing for their saddened home, and her resolution both to consecrate him from his youth to God and to instruct him in God's fear and worship. <span class="cmt_word">And he builded</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was</span> <span class="accented">building</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> began to build, "but never finished, leading still a runagate life, and so often constrained to leave the work, as the giants did who built the tower of Babel" (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">A city</span>. Vater, Hartmann, and Bohlen discover in the city-building of Cain "a main proof of the mythical contents of the narrative," an advanced state of civilization "utterly unsuitable to so early a period;" but ancient tradition (Phoenician, Egyptian, and Hellenic) is unanimous in ascribing to the first men the invention of agriculture and the arts, with the discovery of metals, the origin of music, &c. (vide Havernick's 'Intro.,' &sect; 16). Of course the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> which Cain erected was not a city according to modern ideas, but a keep or fort, enclosed with a wall for the defense of those who dwelt within (Murphy). It was the first step in the direction of civilization, and Kalisch notes it as a deep trait in the Biblical account that the origin of cities is ascribed not to the nomad, but to the agriculturist. Impelled by the necessities of his occupation to have a fixed residence, he would likewise in course of time be constrained by the multiplication of his household to insure their protection and comfort. It is possible also that his attempt to found a city may have been dictated by a desire to bid defiance to the curse which doomed him to a wandering life; to create for his family and himself a new point of interest outside the holy circle of Eden, and to find an outlet for those energies and powers of which, as an early progenitor of the race, he must have been conscious, and in the restless activity of which oblivion for his misery could alone be found. If so, it explains the action which is next recorded of him, that <span class="cmt_word">he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he consecrated it to the realization of these his sinful hopes and schemes.

Considering. the general significance of names, we shall scarcely go astray if with Kalisch we find in the name of the sister of Tubal-cain, "the beautiful," as compared with that of Adam's wife, "the living," a growing symptom of the degeneracy of the times. Beauty, rather than helpfulness, was now become the chief attraction in woman. Men selected wives for their lovely forms and faces rather than for their loving and pious hearts. The reason for the introduction of Naamah s name into the narrative commentators generally are at a loss to discover. Ingiis with much ingenuity connects it with the tragedy which some see in the lines that follow.

The words have an archaic simplicity which bespeak a high antiquity (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' p. 105), naturally fall into that peculiar form of parallelism which is a well-known characteristic of Hebrew poetry, and on this account, as well as from the subject, have been aptly denominated <span class="accented">The Song of the Sword</span> (Ewald, p. 267). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Adah and gillah, Hear my voice;<br />Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:<br />For I have slain a mum to my wounding (for my wound),<br />And a young man to my hurt (because of my strife).<br />If (for) Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br />Truly (and) Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> Origen wrote two whole books of his commentary on Genesis on this song, and at last pronounced it inexplicable. The chief difficulty in its exegesis concerns the sense in which the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> are to be taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> If the verb be rendered as a preterit (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Jamieson, Luther), then Lamech is represented as informing his wives that in self-defense he has slain a young man who wounded him (not two men, as some read), but that there is no reason to apprehend danger on that account; for if God had promised to avenge Cain sevenfold, should any one kill him, he, being not a willful murderer, but at worst a culpable homicide, would be avenged seventy and sevenfold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> If the verb be regarded as a future (Aben Ezra, Calvin, Kiel, Speaker's.

Considering the character of the speaker and the spirit of the times, it is probable that this is the correct interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A third interpretation proposes to understand the words of Lamech hypothetically, as thus: - "If I should slay a man, then," &c. (Lunge, Bush); but this does not materially differ from the first, only putting the case conditionally, which the first asserts categorically. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> A fourth gives to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> the force of a question (<span class="accented">vide</span> Stanley Leathes, ' Hebrews Gram.,' p. 202), and imagines Lamech to be assuring his wives, who are supposed to have been apprehensive of some evil befalling their husband through the use of Tubal-cain's dangerous weapons, that there was no cause for their anxieties and alarms, as he had not slain a man, that he should be wounded, or a young man, that he should be hurt; but this interpretation, it may be fairly urged, is too strained to be even probably correct.

The medical men of Egypt were held in high repute abroad, and their assistance was at various times required by persons from other countries, as, e.g., Cyrus and Darius (Herod., 3:1, 132). Their knowledge of medicines was extensive, and is referred to both in sacred (Jeremiah 66:11) and profane (Homer, 'Odyssey" 4 . 229) writings. The Egyptian doctors belonged to the sacerdotal order, and were expected to know all things relating to the body, and diseases and remedies contained in the six last of the sacred books of Hermes. According to Pliny (7:56), the study of medicine originated in Egypt (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson in Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol 2. pp. 116, 117). The physicians employed by Joseph were those attached to his own household, or the court practitioners - <span class="cmt_word">to embalm his father:</span>  - literally, <span class="accented">to spice or season</span> (the body of) his father, i.e. to prepare it for burial by means of aromatics; <span class="accented">ut aromatibus condirent</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.), which is putting part of a proceeding for the whole (Tayler Lewis). According to Herodotus (2:86), the embalmers belonged to a distinct hereditary class or guild from the ordinary physicians; but either their formation into such a separate order of practitioners was of later origin (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Kalisch), or Jacob was embalmed by the physicians instead of the embalmers proper because, not being an Egyptian, he could not be subjected to the ordinary treatment of the embalming art ('Speaker's Commentary') - <span class="cmt_word">and the physicians embalmed Israel.</span> The method of preparing mummies in Ancient Egypt has been elaborately described, both by Herodotus (2:86) and Diodorus Sieulus (1:91), and, in the main, the accuracy of their descriptions has been confirmed by the evidence derived from the mummies themselves. According to the most expensive process, which cost one talent of silver, or about &pound;250 sterling, the brain was first extracted through the nostrils by means of a crooked piece of iron, the skull being thoroughly cleansed of any remaining portions by rinsing with drugs; then, through an opening in the left side made with a sharp Ethiopian knife of agate or of flint, the viscera were removed, the abdomen being afterwards purified with palm wine and an infusion of aromatics; next, the disemboweled corpse was filled with every sort of spicery except frankincense, and the opening sewed up; after that the stuffed form was steeped for seventy days in natrum or subcarbonate of soda obtained from the Libyan desert, and sometimes in wax and tanning, bitumen also being employed in later times; and finally, on the expiration of that <span class="accented">period</span>, which was scrupulously observed, the body was washed, wrapped about with linen bandages, smeared over with gum, decorated with amulets, sometimes with a network of porcelain bugles, covered with a linen shroud, and, in due course, transferred to a mummy case (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson's 'Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 471, ed. 1878; Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 118-123).

It has been suggested (Kalisch) that Joseph's power may have been restricted after the expiration of the famine, or that another Pharaoh may have succeeded to the throne who was not so friendly as his predecessor with the grand vizier of the realm; but such conjectures are not required to render Joseph's conduct in this matter perfectly intelligible - <span class="cmt_word">saying, My father made me swear</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">saying</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my father saying), <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me</span> - not bought (Onkelos, Drusius, Ainsworth, Bohlen, and others), but digged, <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">fodi</span> (Vulgate).

A detailed and highly interesting account of the funeral procession of an Egyptian grandee, enabling us to picture to the mind's eye the scene of Jacob s burial, will be found in Wilkinson's 'Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 444, ed. 1878. First servants led the way, carrying tables laden with fruit, cakes, flowers, vases of ointment, wine and other liquids, with three young geese and a calf for sacrifice, chairs and wooden tablets, napkins, and other things. Then others followed bearing daggers, bows, fans, and the mummy cases in which the deceased and his ancestors had been kept previous to burial. Next came a table of offerings, fauteuils, couches, boxes, and a chariot. After these men appeared with gold vases and more offerings. To these succeeded the bearers of a sacred boat and the mysterious eye of Osiris, as the god of stability. Placed in the consecrated boat, the hearse containing the mummy of the deceased was drawn by four oxen and by seven men, under the direction of a superintendent who regulated the march of the funeral. Behind the hearse followed the male relations and friends of the deceased, who either beat their breasts, or gave token of their sorrow by their silence and solemn step as they walked, leaning on their long sticks; and with these the procession closed.

The goren at which the funeral party halted was named Atad (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Buckthorn), either from the name of the owner, or from the quantity of buck-thorn which grew in the neighborhood. <span class="cmt_word">Which is beyond Jordan</span> - literally, <span class="accented">on</span> the <span class="accented">other side of the Jordan, i.e.</span> west side, if the narrator wrote from his own standpoint (Jerome, Drusius, Ainsworth, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Wordsworth, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), in which case the funeral train would in all probability follow the direct route through the country of the Philistines, and Goren Atad would be situated somewhere south of Hebron, in the territory (afterwards) of Judah; but east side of the river if the phrase must be interpreted from the standpoint of Palestine (Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil, Lange, Gerlach, Havernick, Murphy, and others), in which case the burial procession must have journeyed by the wilderness, as the Israelites on a latter occasion did, and probably for not dissimilar reasons. In favor of the former interpretation may be claimed ver. 11, which says the Canaanites beheld the mourning, implying seemingly that it occurred within the borders of Canaan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the west of the Jordan; while support for the latter is derived from ver. 13, which appears to state that after the lamentation at Goren Atad the sons of Jacob carried him into Canaan, almost necessarily involving the inference that Goren Atad was on the east of the Jordan; but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>. If the former is correct, Goren Atad was probably the place which Jerome calls Betagla <span class="accented">tertio ab Hiericho lapide, duobus millibus ab Jordane</span>; if the latter is correct, it does not prove a post-Mosaic authorship (Tuch, Bohlen, &c.), since the phrase appears to have had an ideal usage with reference to Canaan in addition to the objective geographical one (Hengstenberg 'On the Genuineness of the Pentateuch,' vol. 2. p. 260; Keil's 'Introduction,' vol. 1. p. 189; Kalisch 'On Genesis,' p. 776). <span class="cmt_word">And there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.</span> The Egyptians were exceedingly demonstrative and vehement in their public lamentations for the dead, rending their garments, smiting on their breasts, throwing dust and mud on their heads, calling on the deceased by name, and chanting funeral dirges to the music of a tambourine with the tinkling plates removed (Wilkinson's 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 440, ed. 1878). <span class="cmt_word">And he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> This was a special mourning before interment (cf.

"A supernatural remedy does not prevent generation from participating in the corruption of sin.

The doctrine of inherited depravity or transmitted sin has been commonly held to favor the theory which accounts for the origin of the human soul <span class="accented">per traducem</span> (Tertullian, Luther, Delitzsch), in opposition to that which holds it to be due to the creative power of God (Jerome, Augustine, Calvin, Beza, Turretin).

It implies a situation of nearness to God, if not in place at least in spirit; a character of likeness to God (<a href="../../par/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>), and a life of converse with God.

Procopius Gazeus goes beyond this, and thinks that before his son's birth Enoch was "a wicked liver," but then repented. The historian's language, however, does not necessarily imply that his piety was so late in commencing and it is more pleasing to think that from his youth upwards he was "as a shining star for virtue and holiness (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">Three hundred years.</span> As his piety began early, <span class="accented">so</span> likewise did it continue long; it was not intermittent and fluctuating, but steadfast and persevering (cf. <a href="../../par/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And begat sons and daughters.</span> "Hence it is undeniably evident that the stats and use of matrimony doth very well agree with the severest course of holiness, and with the office of a prophet or preacher" (Peele). <span class="cmt_word">And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.</span> "A year of years" (Henry); "the same period as that of the revolution of the earth round the sun.

Modern critics have discovered in the age of Enoch traces of a mythical origin.  They conclude the entire list of names to be not older than the time of the Babylonian Nabonassar, and believe it to be not improbable that "the Babylonians regulated the calendar with the assistance of an Indian astrologer or <span class="accented">ganaka</span> (arithmetician) of the town of <span class="accented">Chanoge"</span> (Von Bohlen). But "it would be strange indeed if just in the life of Enoch, which represents the purest and sublimest unity with God, a heathen and astrological element were intentionally introduced;" and, besides, "it is almost generally admitted that our list contains no astronomical numbers that the years which it specifies refer to the lives of individuals, not to periods of the world; and that none of all these figures is in any way reducible "to a chronological, system" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And Enoch walked with God</span>.

The one denotes absence from the world of sense, and the other indicates the ordinary way in which the soul departs from this world" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">took him.</span> Cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5, 9, 10</a>, where the same word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> is used of Elijah's translation; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). Though the writer to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>) adopts the paraphrase of the LXX., yet his language must be accepted as conveying the exact sense of the words of Moses. Analyzed, it teaches <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the patriarch Enoch did not see death, as did all the other worthies in the catalogue; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that in some mysterious way "he was taken up from this temporal life and transfigured into life eternal, as those of the faithful will be who shall be alive at the coming of Christ to judgment" (Keil). The case of Elijah, who was also taken up, and who afterwards appeared in glory on the mount of transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>.), appears to determine the locality into which Enoch was translated (which Kaliseh willingly leaves to antiquaries to decide) to be neither the terrestrial Eden (certain Popish writers) nor the heavenly paradise where the pious dead are now assembled - sheol (Delitzsch and Lange), but the realm of celestial glory (Keil). That the departure of the good man was witnessed by his contemporaries we may infer from what occurred in the case of Elijah; and, indeed, unless it had been so it is difficult to see how it could have served the end for which apparently it was designed, which was not solely to reward Enoch's piety, but to demonstrate the certainty and to stimulate the hope of immortality. That the memory of an event so remarkable should have survived not merely in Jewish (Ecclus. 44:16) and Christian tradition (<a href="../../par/jude/1-15.htm">Jude 1:15</a>), but also in heathen fable, is nothing marvelous. The Book of Enoch, compiled probably by a Jew in the days of Herod the Great, describes the patriarch as exhorting, his son Methuselah and all his contemporaries to reform their evil ways; as penetrating with his prophetic eye into the remote future, and exploring all mysteries in earth and heaven; as passing a retired life after the birth of his eldest son in intercourse with the angels and in meditation on Divine matters; and as at length being translated to heaven in order to reappear in the time of the Messiah, leaving behind him a number, of writings on religion and morality. The Book of Jubilees relates that he was carried into paradise, where he writes down the judgment of all men, their wickedness and eternal punishment" (Kalisch). Arabic legend declares him to have been the inventor of writing and arithmetic. The Phrygian sagsannacus (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: "nomen detortum ab Chanoch") is said by Stephanus Byzantinus, and Suidas, who corrupts the name into Nannacus, to have lived before the flood of Deucalion, to have attained an age of more than 300 years, to have foreseen the flood, gathered all the people into a temple and made supplication to God, and finally to have been translated into heaven. "Classical writers also mention such translations into heaven; they assign this distinction among others to Hercules, to Ganymede, and to Romutus (54:1:16: "nec deinde in terris fuit"). But it was awarded to them either for their valor or their physical beauty, and not, as the translation of Enoch, for "a pious and religious life." Nor is "<span class="accented">the</span> idea of a translation to heaven limited to the old world; it was familiar to the tribes of Central America; the chronicles of Guatemala record four progenitors of mankind who were suddenly raised to heaven; and the documents add that those first men came to Guatemala from the other side of the sea, from the East" (cf. Rosenm&uuml;ller and Kalisch, in <span class="accented">loco</span>).

Possibly he had nothing but a dim, vague expectation of some good thing - the destruction of sinners in the Flood (Chrysostom), the use of the plough (R. Solomon), the grant of animal food (Kalisch), the invention of the arts and implements of husbandry (Sherlock, Bush) - that God was about to bestow upon his weary heritage; or at most a hope that the promise would be fulfilled in his son s day (Bonar), if not in his son himself (Calovius).

That the sons are mentioned in the order of their ages (Knobel, Kalisch, Keil, Colenso) may seem to be deducible <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the fact that they usually stand in this order (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-10.htm">Genesis 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the circumstance that it is commonly the eldest son's birth which is stated in the preceding list, though this is open to doubt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, which, according to Calvin, Knobel, Keil, and others, describes Shem as Japheth's elder brother; and <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>, which, according to Keil, affirms Ham to be the younger son of Noah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-31</a>, in which the order is reversed, but not otherwise altered. But there is reason to believe that Japheth was the eldest and Ham the youngest of the patriarch's children (Michaelis, Clarke, Murphy, Wordsworth, Quarry). According to <a href="../../par/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a> Shem was born 97 years before the Flood, while (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>) Noah was 600 years old at the time of the Flood. Hence, if Noah began to beget children in his 500th year, and Shem was born in Noah's 503rd year, the probability is that the firstborn son was Japheth. In accordance with this <a href="../../par/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a> is understood by LXX., Vulgate, Michaelis, Lange, Quarry, and others to assert the priority in respect of age of Japheth. In the narrative ahem is placed first as being spiritually, though not physically, the firstborn. Ranke perceives in the mention of the three sons an indication that each was subsequently "to lay the foundation of a new beginning." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN. The chronology of the present chapter represents man as having been in existence at the time of the Deluge exactly 1656 years. According to the Septuagint, which Josephus follows except in one particular (the age of Lamech), and which proceeds, again with two exceptions (the age of Jared, which it leaves untouched, and that of Lamech, which it increases by six), upon the principle of adding 100 to the Hebrew numbers, the age of man at the date of that catastrophe was 2262 (<span class="accented">vide</span> Chronological Table). The dates of the Samaritan Pentateuch, being manifestly incorrect, need not be considered. Adding to the above dates the subsequent chronological periods from the Deluge to the call of Abram (Hebrew, 367; LXX, 1017), from the call of Abram to the exodus from Egypt (430 years according to one calculation, LXX.; 730 according to another, Kalisch), from the exodus to the birth of Christ (1645, Hales; 1593, Jackson; 1491, Ussher; 1531, Petavius; 1320, Bunsen), the antiquity of man, according to the Biblical account, is not less than 5652 and not more than 7536 years. The conclusion thus reached, however, is somewhat scornfully repudiated by modern science, as affording, on either alter. native, an altogether inadequate term of existence for the human race. 1. The evidence of geology is supposed irrefragably to attest that man must have been upon the earth at least 1000 centuries, and probably ten times as long (Wallace on 'Natural Selection,' p. 303). The data for this deduction, as stated by Sir Charles Lyell, are chiefly the discovery, in recent and post Pliocene formations of alleged great antiquity, of fossil human remains and flint implements along with bones of the mammoth and other animals long since extinct ('Antiquity of Man,' <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. - 19.). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "So far as research has been prosecuted in the different quarters of the globe, no remains of man or of his works have been discovered till we come to the lake-silts, the peat-mosses, the river-gravels, and the cave-earths of the post-tertiary period," which seems at least an indirect confirmation of the Biblical record. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The tree canoes, stone hatchets, flint implements, and occasional fragments of the human skeleton," upon which so much is based, "<span class="accented">have</span> been chiefly discovered within the limited area of Southern and Western Europe," while "we have scarcely any information from the corresponding deposits of other regions;" consequently, "till these other regions shall have been examined - and especially Asia, where man flourished long prior to his civilization in Europe - it were premature to hazard any opinion as to man's first appearance on the globe." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "It is true that the antiquity of some of the containing deposits, especially the river drifts, is open to question, and it is also quite possible that the remains of the extinct quadrupeds may in some instances have been reasserted from older accumulations." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Historically we have no means of arriving at the age of these deposits; geologically we can only <span class="accented">approximate</span> the time by comparison with existing operations; while palaeontologically - the differences between these extinct pachyderms and those still existing are not greater than that which appears between the several living species, and would therefore indicate no great palaeontological antiquity - nothing that may not have taken place within a few thousand years of the ordinarily received chronology" (Page on 'The Philosophy of Geology,' <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. pp. 114-117). With these undesigned replies from a late eminent authority in geological science, the Bible student will do well to pause before displacing the currently-received age of man by the fabulous duration claimed for him by the first-named writers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/genesis/6.htm"><title>Genesis 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/genesis/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/genesis/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/genesis/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../genesis/5.htm" title="Genesis 5">&#9668;</a> Genesis 6 <a href="../genesis/7.htm" title="Genesis 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">it was</span>; not in immediate sequence to the preceding chapter, but at some earlier point in the antediluvian period; perhaps about the time of Enoch (corresponding to that of Lamech the Cainite), if not in the days of Enos.

The difficulty of building a vessel of such enormous magnitude, T. Lewis thinks, may be got over by remembering the extreme simplicity of its structure, the length of time allowed for its erection, the physical constitution of the builders, and the facilities for obtaining materials which may have existed in abundance in their vicinity. Bishop Wilkins ('Essay towards a Philosophical Character and Language'), Dr. A. Clarke, and Bush are satisfied that the ark was large enough to contain all the animals directed to be taken into it, along with provision for a twelvemonth; but computations founded on the number of the species presently existing must of necessity be precarious; and besides, it is at least doubtful whether the Deluge was universal, or only partial and local, in which case the difficulty (so called) completely vanishes.

That the distinction between clean and unclean animals was at this time understood is easier to believe than that the writer would perpetrate the glaring anachronism of introducing in prediluvian times what only took its rise several centuries later (Kalisch). That this distinction was founded on nature, "every tribe of mankind being able to distinguish between the sheep and the hyena, the dove and the vulture" ('Speaker's Commentary'), or "on an immediate conscious feeling of the human spirit, not yet clouded by any ungodly and unnatural culture, which leads it to see in many beasts pictures of sin and corruption" (Keil), has been supposed; but with greater probability it was of Divine institution, with reference to the necessities of sacrifice (Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>). To this was appended in the Levitical system a distinction between clean and unclean in respect of man's food (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou take</span> - inconsistent with <a href="../../par/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>, which says the animals were to come to Noah (Colenso); but <a href="../../par/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>, which says that Noah was to bring them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make them go (at least nearly equivalent to take), clearly recognizes Noah's agency (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">to thee by sevens.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">seven, seven</span>; either seven <span class="accented">pairs</span> (Vulgate, LXX., Aben Ezra, Clericus, Michaells, De Wette, Knobel, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary'), or seven individuals (Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, Calvin, Pererius, Wiliet, Delitzsch, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Bush); both parties quoting the next clause in support of their particular interpretation. Davidson, Colenso, and Kalisch challenge both interpretations as "irreconcilable with the preceding narrative" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>); but the obvious answer is, that while in the first communication, which was given 120 years before, when minute instructions were not required, it is simply stated that the animals should be preserved by pairs; in the second, when the ark was finished and the animals were about to be collected, it is added that, in the case of the few clean beasts used for sacrifice, an exception should be made to the general rule, and not one pair, but either three pairs with one over, or seven pairs, should be preserved. <span class="cmt_word">The male and his female</span>. This seems to be most in favor of the first interpretation, that pairs, and not individuals, are meant. <span class="cmt_word">And of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.</span> <span class="accented">Ish veishto</span>. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>, where the phrase denotes the ethical personality of human beings, to which there is here an approximation, as the preserved animals were designed to be the parents of subsequent races.

The straits to which the advocates of the documentary hypothesis are sometimes reduced are remarkably exemplified by the fortunes of these verses (21-23) in the attempt to assign them to their respective authors. Astruc conjectures that ver. 21 was taken from what he calls monumentum B, ver. 22 from "monument" A, and ver. 23 from monument C. Eichhorn ascribes vers. 21, 22 to an Elohistic author, and ver. 23 to a Jehovistic. Ilgen assigns vers. 21, 22 to the first, and ver. 23 to the second Elohist. Bleek, all three to the Elohist; and Davidson ver. 21 to the Elohist, vers. 22, 23 to the Jehovist.

All but universal tradition has decided that the loftiest of these two peaks (called Macis in Armenian; Aghri-Dagh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the difficult or steep mountain, by the Turks; Kuchi Nuch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mountain of Noah, by the Persians) was the spot where the sacred vessel first felt the solid land. Travelers describe the appearance of this amazing elevation as of incomparable and overpowering splendor. "It appeared as if the highest mountains in the world had been piled upon each other to form this one sublime immensity of earth and rocks and snow. The icy peaks of its double head rose majestically into the clear and cloudless heavens; the sun blazed bright upon them, and the reflection sent forth a radiance equal to other suns" (Ker Porters 'Travels, 1:132; 2:636). "Nothing can be more beautiful than its shape, more awful than its height. All the surrounding mountains sink into insignificance when compared to it. It is perfect in all its parts; no hard, rugged feature, no unnatural prominences; everything is in harmony, and all combines to render it one of the sublimest objects in nature" (Morier's 'Journey,' 1:16; 2:312, 345). The ascent of the Kara Dagh, or Greater Ararat, which the Armenians believe to be guarded by angels from the profane foot of man, after two unsuccessful attempts, was accomplished in 1829 by Professor Parrot, a German, and five years later, in 1834, by the Russian traveler Automonoff. In 1856 five English travelers, Majors Stewart and Frazer, Roy. Walter Thursby, Messrs. Thee-bald and Evans, performed the herculean task.

As deciphered from the eleventh tablet of the Izdubar series, the story of the Flood is briefly this: - Izdubar, whom George Smith identifies with Nimrod, the founder of Babylonia, is informed by Hasisadra, whom the same authority believes to represent Noah, of a Divine commandment which he had received to construct a ship after a specified pattern, in which to save himself and "the seed of all life," because the city Surippak wherein he dwelt was to be destroyed. After first attempting to excuse himself, as he explains to Izdubar, on the ground that "young and old will deride him," Hasisadra builds the ship, and causes to go up into it "all my male servants and my female the ants, the beast of the field, the animal of the field, the sons of the people, all of them," while the god Shamas makes a flood, causing it to rain heavily. The flood destroys all life from the face of the earth Six days and nights the storm rages; on the seventh it grows calm. Twelve measures above the sea rises the land. The ship is stopped by a mountain in the country of Nizir. After seven days Hasisadra sends forth a dove, "which went and turned, and a resting-place it did not find, and it returned;" then a swallow, and finally a raven. On the decrease of the waters he sends forth the animals, and builds an altar on the peak of the mountain, and pours out a libation ('Chaldean Genesis,' <a href="../../par/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 7:133-141). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> From Berosus. The god Kronos appeared to Xisuthrus, the tenth Mug of Babylon, in a vision, and warned him of an approaching deluge upon the fifteenth day of the month Desius, by which mankind would be destroyed. Among other things the god instructed him to build a vessel for the preservation of himself and friends, and specimens of the different animals. Obeying the Divine admonition, he built a vessel five stadia in length and two in breadth, and conveyed into it his wife, children, and friends. After the flood had been upon the earth he three times sent out birds from the vessel, which returned to him the second time with mud upon their feet, and the third time returned to him no more. Find. ing that the vessel had grounded on a mountain, Xisuthrus disembarked with his wife and children, and, having constructed an altar, offered sacrifices to the gods, in reward for which he was raized immediately to heaven ('Chaldean Genesis,' <a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>; Kalisch, p. 202; 'Encyclopedia Britannica,' art. Deluge, ninth edition). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The <span class="accented">Egyptian</span>. Though commonly alleged to be entirely unknown in the Nile valley, it is certain that the germs of the Deluge story are to be discovered even there. According to the Egyptian historian Manetho, quoted by Eusebius, Thoth, the first Hermes, erected certain pillars with inscriptions, which, <span class="accented">after the Deluge</span>, were transcribed into books. Plato also states in the Timaeus (chap. 5.) that a certain Egyptian priest informed Solon that the gods, when wishing to purify the earth, were accustomed to overwhelm it by a deluge, from which the herdsmen and shepherds saved themselves on the tops of the mountains. Josephus ('Ant.,' I.3.9) certifies that Hieronymus the Egyptian refers to the Flood. A conception altogether analogous to that of Genesis is likewise to be found in a myth belonging to the archaic period of Seti I., which represents Ra, the Creator, as being disgusted with the insolence of mankind, and resolving to exterminate them (<span class="accented">vide</span> Inscription of the Destruction of Mankind, ' Records of the Past,' vol. 6. p. 103). In short, the Egyptians believed not that there was no deluge, but that there had been several The absence of any indications of this belief in the recovered literature of ancient Egypt is not sufficient to set aside the above concurrent testimonies to its existence (Kitto, 'Bible Illustrations,' vol. 1. p. 150; Rawlinson's 'Historical Illustrations of O. T.;' 'Encycl. Britan.,' art. Deluge, ninth edition). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The <span class="accented">Indian</span>. Through the theft of the sacred Vedas by the giant Hayagrivah, the human race became fearfully degenerate, with the exception of seven saints and the good King Satyavrata, to whom the Divine spirit Vishnu appeared in the form of a fish, in. forming him of his purpose to destroy the earth by a flood, and at the same time to send a ship miraculously constructed for the preservation of himself and the seven holy ones, along with their wives, and one pair of each of all the irrational animals. After seven days the rain descended, when Satyavrata, confiding in the promises of the god, saw a huge ship drawing near, into which he entered as directed. Then the god appeared in the form of a fish a million miles long, with an immense horn, to which the king made the ship fast, and, drawing it for many years (a night of Brahma), at length landed it upon the highest peak of Mount Himavau. When the flood abated the god arose, struck the demon Hayagrivah, recovered the sacred books, instructed Satyavrata in all heavenly sciences, and appointed him the seventh Mann, from whom the second population of the earth descended in a supernatural manner, whence man is styled Manudsha (born of Mann). <span class="accented">Vide</span> Kalisch, p. 203; Auberlen's 'Divine Revelation,' p. 169 (Clark's 'For. Theol. Lib.' ). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The <span class="accented">Grecian</span>. It is sufficient here to refer to the well-known story of Deucalion and Pyrrha, first given in Pindar, and afterwards related by Apollodorus, Plutarch, Lucian, and Ovid, whose account bears so close a resemblance to the Biblical narrative as to suggest the probability of access to Hebrew or Syrian sources of information. The previous corruption of manners and morals, the eminent piety of Deucalion, the determination "genus mortals sub undisperdere," the construction of a boat by Divine direction, the bursting of the storm, the rising of the waters, the universal ocean in which "jamque mare et tellus nullum discrimen habebant," the subsidence of the flood, the landing of the boat on Parnassus with its double peak, the consultation of the Deity "<span class="accented">per</span> sacras sortes," and the answer of the god as to how the earth was to be re-peopled "ossaque post tergum magnae jactare parentis," are detailed with such graphic power as makes them read "<span class="accented">like</span> amplified reports of the record in Genesis." Indeed, by Philo, Deucalion was distinctly regarded as Noah. Cf. Ovid, 'Metamorph.,' lib. 1. f. 7; 'Kalisch on Genesis,' p. 203; Kitto's 'Bible Illustrations,' p. 150 (Porter's edition); 'Lange on Genesis,' p. 294, note by Tayler Lewis; Smith's ' Dictionary of the Bible,' art. Noah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The <span class="accented">American</span>. Traditions of the Flood appear to be even more numerous in the New World than the Old. The Esquimatux in the North, the Red Indians, the Mexicans and the Brazilians in the central parts of America, and the Peruvians in the South have all their peculiar versions of the Deluge story. Chasewee, the ancestor of the Dog. rib Indians, on the Mackensie river, according to Franklin, escaped in a canoe from a flood which overflowed the earth, taking with him all manner of four-footed beasts and birds. The Astees, the Mixtees, the Zapotess, and other nations inhabiting Mexico all have, according to Humboldt, their Noahs, Xisuthrus, or Manus (called Coxcox, Teocipactli, or Tezpi), who saves himself by a raft, or in a ship, which lands upon the summit of Colhuacan, the Ararat of the Mexicans. The legends of the Tamanacks relate that a man and woman saved themselves from the Deluge, and repeopled the earth by casting behind them the fruits of the Mauritia palm tree (Kalisch, p. 205; Auberlen's 'Divine Revelation,' p. 171; Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. Noah). What, then, is the conclusion to be drawn from this universal diffusion of the Deluge story? The theory of Schirren and Gerland, as stated by the writer of the article Deluge in the 'Encyclopedia Britannica,' is that the Deluge stories were originally other-myths, descriptive of the phenomena of the sky, which have been transferred from the celestial regions to the earth; but, as Kalisch justly observes, "the harmony between all these accounts is an undeniable guarantee that the tradition is no idle invention;" or, as is forcibly stated by Rawlinson, of a tradition existing among all the great races into which ethnologists have divided mankind,  - the Shemites, the Hamites, the Aryans, the Turanians, - "but one rational account can be given, viz., that it embodies the recollection of a fact in which all mankind was concerned." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../genesis/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Genesis 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Genesis 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../genesis/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Genesis 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Genesis 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The original relationship which God had established between man and the lower creatures having been disturbed by sin, the inferior animals, as it were, gradually broke loose from their condition of subjection. As corruption deepened in the human race it was only natural to anticipate that man's lordship over the animal creation would become feebler and feebler. Nor, perhaps, is it an altogether violent hypothesis that, had the Deluge not intervened, in the course of time the beast would have become the master and man the slave. To prevent any such apprehensions in the future, as there was to be no second deluge, the relations of man and the lower creatures were to be placed on a new footing. Ultimately, in the palingenesia, they would be completely restored (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>); in the mean time, till that glorious consummation should arrive, the otherwise inevitable encroachments of the creatures upon the human family in its sin-created weakness should be restrained by a principle of fear. That was the first important modification made upon the original Adamic blessing.

The relation of this verse to the former has been understood as signifying - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That animal food was expressly prohibited before the Flood, and now for the first time permitted (Mercerus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Candlish, Clarke, Murphy, Jamieson, Wordsworth, Kalisch) - the ground being that such appears the obvious import of the sacred writer s language. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That, though permitted from the first, it was not used till postdiluvian times, when men were explicitly directed to partake of it by God (Theodoret, Chrysostom, Aquinas, Luther, Pererius) - the reason being that prior to the Flood the fruits of the earth were more nutritious and better adapted for the sustenance of man's physical frame, propter excellentem terrae bonitatem praestantemque vim alimenti quod fructus terrae suppeditabant homini, while after it such a change passed upon the vegetable productions of the ground as to render them less capable of supporting the growing feebleness of the body, invalidam ad bene alendum hominem (Petetins). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That whether permitted or not prior to the Flood, it was used, and is here for the first time formally allowed (Keil, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary'); in support of which opinion it may be urged that the general tendency of subsequent Divine legislation, until the fullness of the times, was ever in the direction of concession to the infirmities or necessities of human nature (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>). The opinion, however, which appears to be the best supported is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That animal food was permitted before the fall, and that the grant is h ere expressly renewed (Justin Martyr, Calvin, Willet, Bush, Macdonald, Lange, Quarry).

Solomon Glass thus correctly indicates the connection and the sense: "ut viridem herbam (illis), sic illa omnia dedi vobis" ('Sacr.

Literally, <span class="accented">with its soul, its blood</span>; the blood being regarded as the seat of the soul, or life principle (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and even as the soul itself (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>). The idea of the unity of the soul and the blood, on which the prohibition of blood is based, comes to light everywhere in Scripture. In the blood of one mortally wounded his soul flows forth (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>), and he who voluntarily sacrifices himself pours out his soul unto death (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>).

Nor can it be said to be exclusively peculiar to Holy Scripture. In ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics the hawk, which feeds on bloods, represents the soul. Virgil says of a dying person, "purpuream vomit ille animam" ('AEneid,' 9:349). The Greek philosophers taught that the blood was either the soul (Critias), or the soul s food (Pythagoras), or the soul's seat (Empedocles), or the soul's producing cause (the Stoics); but only Scripture reveals the true relation between them both when it declares the blood to be not the soul absolutely, but the means of its self-attestation (vide Delitzsch s ' Bib. Psychology,' div. 4. sec. 11.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye not eat.</span> Not referring to, although certainly forbidding, the eating of flesh taken from a living animal (Raschi, Cajetan, Delitzsch, Luther, Peele, Jamieson) - a fiendish custom which may have been practiced among the antediluvians, as, according to travelers, it is, or was, among modern Abyssinians; rather interdicting the flesh of slaughtered  animals from which the blood has not been properly drained (Calvin, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Wordsworth). The same prohibition (commonly regarded by the Hebrew doctors as the seventh of the Noachic precepts which were enjoined upon all nations; <span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 6) was afterwards incorporated in the Mosaic legislation (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16, 23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>), and subsequently imposed upon the Gentile converts in the Christian Church by the authority of the Holy Ghost and the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28, 29</a>). Among other reasons, doubtless, for the original promulgation of this law were these: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A desire to guard against the practice of cruelty to animals (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A design to hedge about human life by showing the inviolability which in God s eye attached to even the lives of the lower creatures (Calvin, Willet, Peele, Kalisch, Murphy). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The intimate connection which even in the animal creation subsisted between the blood and the life (Kurtz, 'Sacr. Worship,' I. A.V.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Its symbolic use as an atonement for sin (Peele, Delitzsch, ' Bib. Psy.' 4:11; Keil, Wordsworth, Murphy).

The contrary opinion has been maintained that it now for the first time appeared (Bush, Keil, Delitzsch), or at least that the historian thought so (Knobel); but unless there had been no rain, or the laws of light and the atmospheric conditions of the earth had been different from what they are at present, it must have been a frequent spectacle in the primeval heavens. <span class="cmt_word">My bow.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rainbow, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). The ordinary rainbow consists of a series of successive zones or bands of polarized light, forming little concentric circles in the sky, and having a common center almost always below the horizon, and diametrically opposite to the sun. It is produced by the refraction and reflection of the sun's light through the spherical raindrops on which the rays fall, and, accordingly, must always appear, with a greater or a lesser degree of visibility, when the two material agencies come in contact The part of the sky on which the rainbow is thrown is much more bright within than without the bow. The outer space is dark, almost black; and the inner space, on the contrary, melts into the violet almost insensibly (Nichol's 'Cyclopedia of the Sciences,' art. Rainbow). It is here styled God's bow, as being his workmanship (cf. Ecclus. 43:12), and his seal appended to his covenant (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-17.htm">Genesis 9:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the cloud</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">that which veils the heavens</span>, from a root signifying to cover (Gesenius). <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be for a token,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>   =   <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX.).

The Persians seem to have associated the rainbow with similar ideas. An old picture, mentioned by Stolberg, represents a winged boy on a rainbow with an old man kneeling in a posture, of worship. The Hindoos describe the rainbow as a warlike weapon in the hands of Indras their god, "<span class="accented">with</span> which he hurls flashing darts upon the impious giants;" but also as a symbol of peace exhibited to man "when the combat of the heavens is silenced." By the Chinese it is regarded as the harbinger of troubles and misfortunes on earth, and by the old Scandinavians as a bridge uniting earth and heaven ('Kalisch on Genesis,' pp. 223, 224). Traditional reflections of the Biblical narrative, they do not "account for the application in the Pentateuch of the rainbow to a very remarkable purpose," or "explain why the New Testament represents the rainbow as an attribute of the Divine throne," or "why angels are sent as messengers on earth" (Kalisch); but are themselves accounted for and explained by it. The institution of the rainbow as a sign clearly negatives the idea (Aquinas, Cajetan) that it was originally and naturally a sign; which, if it was, "it was a lying sign," since the Flood came notwithstanding its prognostications (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">Of a covenant</span>.

One of those pregnant Scripture sayings that have in them an almost inexhaustible fullness of meaning, which does not at first sight dis. close itself to the eye of the unreflecting reader. In so far as the Noachic covenant was simply a promise that there should be no recurrence of a flood, the covenant of eternity had a corresponding limit in its duration to the period of this present terrestrial economy. But, rightly viewed, the Noachic covenant was the original Adamic covenant set up again in a different form; and hence, when applied to it, the phrase <span class="cmt_word">covenant of eternity</span> is entitled to retain its highest and fullest significance, as a covenant reaching from eternity to eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Between God and every living creature of all-flesh that is upon the earth.</span>

Kalisch compares with the rainbow the other signs which God subsequently appended to his covenants; as, e.g., circumcision (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>), the passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>), the sabbath (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 31:13).

The present section, extending to ver. 27, is usually assigned to the Jehovistic author (Tuch,Bleek, Kalisch, Colenso, Kuenen), though by Davidson it is ascribed to a so-called redactor, with the exception of the present clause, which is recognized as the Jehovist's contribution to the story.

The reason for the insertion of this notice here, and of the similar one in ver. 22, was obviously to draw attention to the circumstance, not "that the origin of Israel's ascendancy and of Canaan's degradation dates so far back as the family of the second founder of the human race," as if the writer's standpoint were long subsequent to the conquest (Kalisch), but that, "as Israel was now going to possess the land of Canaan, they might know that now was the time when the curse of Canaan and his posterity should take place" (Wilier).

That Armenia is a wine-growing country is testified by Xenophon ('Anab.,' 4:4, 9). That the vine was abundantly cultivated in Egypt is evident from representations on the monuments, as well as from Scriptural allusions. The Egyptians say that Osiris, the Greeks that Dionysus, the Romans that Saturn, first taught men the cultivation of the tree and the use of its fruit.

Though the first mention of wine in Scripture, it is scarcely probable that the natural process of fermentation for so many centuries escaped the notice of the enterprising Cainites, or even of the Sethites; that, "though grapes had been in use before this, wine had not been extracted from them" (Murphy); or that Noah was unacquainted with the nature and effects of this intoxicating liquor (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Keil, Lunge). The article before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> indicates that the patriarch was "familiar with the use and treatment" of the grape (Kalisch); and Moses does not say this was the first occasion on which the patriarch tasted the fermented liquor (Calvin, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And was drunken</span>.

Since the sin of Noah cannot be ascribed to ignorance, it is perhaps right, as well as charitable, to attribute it to ago and inadvertence. Six hundred years old at the time of the Flood, he must have been considerably beyond this when Ham saw him overtaken in his fault, since Canaan was Ham's fourth son (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>), and the first was not born till after the exit from the ark (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>).

Generally believed to have been Ham, though by many Canaan is understood (Aben Ezra, Theodoret, Procopius, Scaliger, Poole, Jamieson, Inglis, Lewis). Origen mentions a tradition that Canaan first saw the shame of Noah, and told it to his father. Wordsworth, following Chrysostom, believes Canaan may have been an accomplice. 'The Speaker's Commentary' thinks it would solve the difficulty which attaches to the cursing of Canaan.

Not in personal resentment, since "the fall of Noah is not at all connected with his prophecy, except as serving to bring out the real character of his children, and to reconcile him to the different destinies which he was to announce as awaiting their respective races" (Candlish); but under the impulse of a prophetic spirit (Poole, Keil, Lange, Candlish, Murphy, and expositors generally), which, however, had its historical occasion in the foregoing incident. The structure of the prophecy is perfectly symmetrical, introducing, in three poetical verses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the curse of Canaan, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the blessing of Shem, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the enlargement of Japheth, and in all three giving prominence to the doom of servitude pronounced upon the son of Ham. <span class="cmt_word">Cursed</span>. The second curse pronounced upon a human being, the first having been on Cain (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>). Colenso notices that all the curses belong to the Jehovistic writer; but <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 49:6, 7, which Tuch and Bleek ascribed to the Elohist, though, doubtless in consequence of the "curse," by Davidson and others it is now assigned to the Jehovist. That this curse was not an imprecation, but a prediction of the future subjection of the Canaanites, has been maintained (Theodoret, Venema, Willet), chiefly in consequence of its falling upon Canaan; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as the contrary "blessing" implies the inheritance of good in virtue of a Divine disposition to that effect, so does "cursing" import subjection to evil by the same Divine power; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if we eliminate the moral element from the doom of Canaan, which clearly referred to a condition of temporal servitude, there seems no reason why the language of Noah should not be regarded as a solemnly pronounced and Divinely guaranteed infliction; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as the curse is obviously aimed at the nations and peoples descending from the execrated person, it is not inconsistent to suppose that many individuals amongst those nations and peoples might attain to a high degree of temporal and spiritual prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Be Canaan</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Not Ham, the father of Canaan (Arabic Version); nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> all the sons of Ham, though concentrated in Canaan (Havernick, Keil, Murphy); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Canaan alone, though indirectly, through him, Ham also (Calvin, Bush, Kalisch, Lange, <span class="accented">et alii</span>). For the formal omission of Ham many different reasons have been assigned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because God had preserved him in the ark (Jewish commentators). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because if Ham had been mentioned all his other sons would have been implicated (Pererius, Lange). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because the sin of Ham was comparatively trifling (Bohlen). For the cursing of Canaan instead of Ham, it has been urged - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That he was Ham's youngest son, as Ham was Noah's (Hoffman and Delitzsch); surely a very insufficient reason for God cursing any one! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That he was the real perpetrator of the crime (Aben Ezra, Procopius, Poole, Jamieson, Lewis, &c.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That thereby the greatness of Ham's sin was evinced (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That Canaan was already walking in the steps of his father's impiety (Ambrose, Mercerus, Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That Noah foresaw that the Canaanites would abundantly deserve this visitation (Calvin, Wordsworth, Murphy, Kalisch, Lange). We incline to think the truth lies in the last three reasons. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of servants</span>. A Hebraism for the superlative degree; cf. "King of kings, "holy of holies, "the song of songs" (vide Gesenius, &sect; 119). <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "the last even among servants" (Calvin); "a servant reduced to the lowest degree of bondage and degradation" (Bush); "vilissima servituts pressus" (Sol. Glass); "a most base and vile servant" (Ainsworth); "a working servant" (Chaldee); "the lowest of slaves" (Keil); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), which "conveys the notion of permanent hereditary servitude" (Kalisch). Keil, Hengstenberg, and Wordsworth see an allusion to this condition in the name Canaan (<span class="accented">q</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.<span class="accented">, supra</span>), which, however, Lange doubts. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he be to his brethren</span>. A prophecy which was afterwards abundantly fulfilled, the Canaanites in the time of Joshua having been partly exterminated and partly reduced to the lowest form of slavery by the Israelites who belonged to the family of Shem (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>), those that remained being subsequently reduced by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>); while the Phenicians, along with the Carthaginians and Egyptians, who all belonged to the family of Canaan, were subjected by the Japhetic Persians, Macedonians, and Romans (Keil).

In the name Shem (name, renown) there may lie an allusion to the spiritual exaltation and advancement of the Semitic nations (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 5:32). <span class="cmt_word">And Canaan shall be his servant.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span>  =   <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;</span> (Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two brothers (Delitzsch), their descendants (Knobel, Keil), Shem and Jehovah (Bush); or more probably  -  <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, as a collective singular (cf.

If vers. 18-27 are Jehovistic (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), why Elohim? Is this a proof that the Jehovistic document was revised by the Elohistic author, as the presence of Jehovah in any so-called Elohistic section is regarded as an interpolation by the supplementer? To obviate this inference Davidson assigns vers. 20-27 to his redactor. But the change of name is sufficiently explained when we remember that "Jehovah, as such, never was the God of Japheth's descendants, and that the expression would have been as manifestly improper if applied to him as it is in its proper place applied to Shem" (Quarry, p. 393). <span class="cmt_word">Shall enlarge Japheth</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall enlarge or make room for the one that spreads abroad</span>; or, "may God concede an ample space to Japheth" (Gesenius). "Wide let God make it for Japheth" (Keil). "God give enlargement to Japheth" (Lange). So LXX., Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic. The words form a paronomasia, both the verb and the noun being connected with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to spread abroad; Hiph., to cause to lie open, hence to make room for, - and refer to the widespread diffusion and remarkable prosperity of the Japhetic nations. The familiar interpretation which renders "God will persuade Japheth, the persuadable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> incline his heart by the gospel so that he may dwell in the tents of Shem (Junins, Vatablus, Calvin, Willet, Ainsworth), is discredited by the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the verb never means to persuade, except in a bad sense (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that in this sense it is never followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, but always by the accusative (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub</span>. <span class="accented">nom</span>.; cf. Bush, p. 109). The fulfillment of the prophecy is apparent from the circumstance that "praeter Europam (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>  -  wide, extensive) "maximam Asiae pattern, totum demique novum orbem, veluti immensae maguitudinis auctarium, Japheto posterique ejus in perpetuam possessionem obtigisse" (Fuller, ' Sac.

The expansive power of Japheth "refem not only to the territory and the multitude of the Japhethites, but also to their intellectual and active faculties. The metaphysics of the Hindoos, the philosophy of the Greeks, the military prowess of the Romans, and the modern science and civilization of the world are due to the race of Japheth" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span>  - not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (Philo., Theodoret, Onkelos, Dathe, Baumgarten, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), which <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> substantially repeats the blessing already given to Shem, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> would introduce an allusion to the superiority of Shem's blessing in what the context requires should be an unrestricted benediction of Japheth; but <span class="accented">Japheth</span> (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Keil, Lange, Kaliseh, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary')  -  <span class="cmt_word">shall dwell</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to dwell; used of God inhabiting the heavens (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>), dwelling in the bush (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>), residing, or causing his name to dwell, in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>); hence supposed to favor the idea that Elohim is the subject; but it was as Jehovah (not Elohim) that God abode between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the tents of Shem</span>. Not the tents of celebrity (Gesenius, Vater, Michaelis, De Wette, Knobel), but the tents of the Shemitic races, with allusion not to their subjugation by the Japhethites (Clericus, Von Bohlen, Bochart), which would not be in keeping with the former blessing pronounced upon them (Murphy), but to their subsequent contiguity to, and even commingling with, but especially to their participation in the religious privileges of, the Shemites (the Fathers, Targum Jonathan, Hisronymus, Calvin, Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish).
