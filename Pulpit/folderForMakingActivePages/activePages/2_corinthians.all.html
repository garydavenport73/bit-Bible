The word for "strongholds" is found here alone. These "fortresses" were the opposition aroused by factious and hostile partisans, and he hoped to subdue them by the strong exercise of apostolic authority (l Corinthians 4:21; 5:1-5). Dean Stanley suggests a reminiscence of the hundred and twenty <span class="accented">Cilician</span> fortresses pulled down by Pompey; but I think that these general allusions are often pressed too far.

This he proceeds to prove by the fact that he was the founder of their Church (vers. 13-18); that he had always acted with absolute disinterestedness (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-1.htm">2 Corinthians 11:1-15</a>); that he had lived a life of toil and suffering (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21-33</a>), and that he had received special revelations from God (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-6</a>).

The fact that a word could thus possess and dominate over his style and imagination shows how deeply he was moved. The Corinthian Church, with its inflated factions and their fuglemen, recked with beasting, and St. Paul is driven, with utter distaste, to adopt in self-defence language which, to the uncandid and indiscriminating, might seem to wear the same aspect. The word, which is unfrequent in other Epistles, occurs eighteen times in these chapters alone. Other haunting words are "tolerate," "bear with" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>:l, 4, 19, 20), and "senseless," "fool" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-16.htm">2 Corinthians 11:16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-6.htm">2 Corinthians 12:6, 11</a>); see note on 2 Corinthians 1:3. <span class="cmt_word">Somewhat more</span>; <span class="accented">something more abundantly</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For edification, and not for your destruction;</span> <span class="accented">for building you up, not pulling you down</span>.

The phrase may, indeed, imply "it is said" (<span class="accented">on dit</span>); but it may refer to one main critic and opponent (comp. vers. 7, 11). Perhaps it would have been wiser and kinder if no one had reported to St. Paul all these subterranean calumnies and innuendoes. <span class="cmt_word">Weighty and strong.</span> This could not be denied, considering the immense effect which had been produced by his first letter (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His bodily presence is weak.</span> This is usually taken to mean that St. Paul's personal appearance was unprepossessing  (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>). This, indeed, we should infer from many other passages (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>:34; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>), and as a natural result of his "stake in the flesh." It is, too, the consistent though late tradition respecting him (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:628). Here, however, the words may mean no more than that "he adds nothing to his cause by being present in person, since he shows vacillation and want of energy." <span class="cmt_word">Contemptible</span>; rather, <span class="accented">despised</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3, 4</a>).

The reading, however, of the Authorized Version is undoubtedly right, and most probably the rendering also. The meaning is that the little cliques of factious religionists, never looking outside their own narrow circles, became inflated with a sense of importance which would have been annihilated if they had looked at higher standards. Hence they thought themselves at liberty to intrude and lay down the law and usurp a claim to infallibility which there was nothing to justify. Such conduct is the reverse of wise. It is a mixture of selfishness, Pharisaism, and conceit, and there have been abundant examples of it among religious parties in all ages. St. Paul, on the other hand, keeps within his own measure, because he has learnt to adopt larger and loftier standards.

The word here used is <span class="accented">sargane</span>, which is defined by Hesychius to be a basket of wickerwork, but which may also mean a rope basket. This particular incident, no doubt, seems to be less perilous and trying than many which St. Paul has already mentioned. We must, however, remember that escape from a window in the lofty wall of a city guarded by patrols was very perilous, and also that such a method of concealment was very trying to the dignity of an Oriental rabbi,   such as St. Paul had been. Further, it is clear that St. Paul only mentions this as the earliest incident in along line of perils which it had been his original intention to recount. But at this point he was interrupted, and laid aside his task of dictation - an incident which has not unfrequently had its effect in literature. When next he resumed, the Epistle, he was no longer in the mood to break through his rule of reticence on these subjects. He had played "the fool" and "the madman," as he says of himself with indignant irony, enough; and he proceeds to speak of other personal claims which he regards as more Important and more Divine. Of all "chapters of unwritten history," not one is more deeply to be regretted than the one which we have them lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm"><title>2 Corinthians 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_corinthians/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_corinthians/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_corinthians/11.htm" title="2 Corinthians 11">&#9668;</a> 2 Corinthians 12 <a href="../2_corinthians/13.htm" title="2 Corinthians 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

The vision on the road to Damascus had occurred about twenty years earlier than the date of this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Whether in the body,</span> etc. A powerful description of the absorption of all conscious <span class="accented">bodily</span> modes of apprehension. In their comments on. these verses, many commentators enter into speculations which seem to me to be so entirely arbitrary and futile that I shall not even allude to them. St. Paul's bodily and mental state during this vision is familiar to all who know the history of Oriental and mediaeval mysticism. <span class="cmt_word">Caught up</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the third heaven.</span> It is most unlikely that St. Paul is here in any way referring to the Jewish <span class="accented">hagadoth</span> about seven heavens. The expression is purely general, and even the rabbis did not expect to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre</span>. Hence all speculations about first, second, and third heavens are idle and useless. Even as late as the Clementine writings in the middle of the second century, an attempt is made, in reference to this passage, to disparage St. Paul by sneering at visions as a medium of revelation, on the ground that they may spring from self-deception; and this rapture of the "bald hook-nosed Galilean" to the third heaven is also sneered at in the 'Philopatris' of the pseudo-Lucian. Yet how modest and simple is St. Paul's awestruck reference to this event, when compared, not only with the lying details of Mohammed's visit to heaven, but even with the visions of St. Theresa or Swedenborg!

Such questions are clearly insoluble, and I leave them where I find them. We shall never understand this passage otherwise than in the dim and vague outline in which St. Paul has purposely left it.

These are the last recorded words addressed by St. Paul to the Corinthian Church. The results produced by the letter and by his visit of three months (<a href="../../par/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 3</a>) were probably satisfactory, for we hear no more of any troubles at Corinth during his lifetime, and the spirit in which he writes the letter to the Romans from Corinth seems to have been unwontedly calm. He had been kindly welcomed (<a href="../../par/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23</a>), and the collection, about which he had been so anxious, seems to have fully equalled his expectations, for as we know (<a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), he conveyed it to Jerusalem in person with the delegates of the Churches. We gain a subsequent glimpse of the Corinthian Church. Some thirty-five years later, when a letter, which is still extant, was addressed to them by St. Clement of Rome, they were still somewhat inclined to be turbulent, disunited, and sceptical (see 'Ep. ad Corinthians,' 3, 4, 13, 14, 37, etc.); but still there are some marked signs of improvement. About A.D.  they were visited by Hegesippus (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:22), who spoke very favourably of them, especially of their obedience and liberality. Their bishop, Dionysius, was at that time exercising a widespread influence (Eusebius 'Hist.

In the face of Judaizing opponents, it was essential that he should vindicate his independent apostolate (<a href="../../par/acts/26-15.htm">Acts 26:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Timothy.</span> Timothy had been absent from St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle, and Sosthenes had taken his place, whether as amanuensis or merely as a sort of joint authenticator. Our brother; literally, <span class="accented">the brother</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>. The brotherhood applies both to St. Paul and to the Corinthians; there was a special bond of brotherhood between all members of "the household of faith." <span class="cmt_word">The saints</span>. Before the name "Christians" had come into general use, "saints" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13</a>) and "brethren" were common designations or' those who were "faithful in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all Achaia.</span> In its classical sense Achaia means only the northern strip of the Peloponnesus; as a Roman province the name included both Hellas and the Peloponnesus. Hero St. Paul probably <span class="accented">uses</span> it in its narrower sense. The only <span class="accented">strictly</span> Achaian Church of which we know is Cenchrea, but doubtless there were little Christian communities along the coasts of the Corinthian gulf. To the Church at Athens St. Paul never directly alludes. This letter was not in any sense an encyclical letter; but even if it were not read in other communities, the Corinthians would convey to them the apostle's greeting. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace be to you and peace.</span> On this pregnant synthesis of the Greek and Hebrew greetings, see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>be</i> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be God</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). This outburst of thanksgiving was meant to repress the relief brought to the overcharged feelings of the apostle by the arrival of Titus, with news respecting the mixed, but on the whole good, effect produced at Corinth by the severe remarks of his first letter. It is characteristic of the intense and impetuous rush of emotion which we often notice in the letters of St. Paul, that he does not here state the special grounds for this impassioned thanksgiving; he only touches upon it for a moment in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>, and does not pause to state it fully until <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5-16</a>. It is further remarkable that in this Epistle almost alone he utters no thanksgiving for the moral growth and holiness of the Church to which he is writing. This may be due to the fact that there was still so much to blame; but it more probably arose from the tumult of feeling which throughout this letter disturbs the regular flow of his thoughts. The ordinary "thanksgiving" for his readers is practically, though indirectly, involved in the gratitude which he expresses to God for the sympathy and communion which exists between himself and the Church of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">Even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The Greek is the same as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, where, literally rendered, it is, "Blessed be the God and Father." The same phrase is found also in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>. The meaning is not, "Blessed be the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (although the expression, "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ," occurs in  <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), but "Blessed be God, who is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," and who is therefore "our Father" by adoption and redemption, as well as our God by creation. <span class="cmt_word">The Father of mercies.</span> This corresponds to a Hebrew expression, and means that <span class="accented">compassionateness</span> is the most characteristic <span class="accented">attribute of</span> God, and <span class="accented">emanation from</span> him. He is the Source of all mercy; and mercy <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Is an attribute of God himself."</span> He is "full of compassion, and gracious, tong-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>). "The Law," says the Talmud, "begins and ends with an act of mercy. At its commencement God clothes the naked; at its close be buries the dead" ('Sotah,' f. 14, 1). Thus every chapter but one of the Koran is headed, "In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful;" and it is an Eastern expression to say of one that has died that. "he is taken to the mercy of the Merciful." Comp. "Father of glory," <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a> ("of spirits," <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>; "of lights," <a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The plural, "compassions," is perhaps a plural of excellence, "exceeding compassion" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), and may be influenced by the Hebrew word <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, often literally rendered by St. Paul "bowels." The article in the Greek ("the Father of <span class="accented">the</span> compassions") <span class="accented">specializes</span> the mercy. The God of all comfort. So in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a> God is called "the God of love and peace;" <a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>, "the God of patience and of comfort;" 2:15, "the God of hope." This word "comfort" (unfortunately interchanged with "consolation" in the Authorized Version) and the word "affliction" (varyingly rendered by "trouble" and "tribulation" in the Authorized Version), are the keynotes of this passage; and to some extent of the whole Epistle. St. Paul is haunted as it were and possessed by them. "Comfort," as verb or substantive, occurs ten times in vers. 3-7; and "affliction" occurs four times in succession. It is characteristic of St. Paul's style to be thus dominated, as it were, by a single word (comp. notes on 2 Corinthians 3:2, 13; 4:2; see note on 2 Corinthians 10:8). The needless variations of the Authorized Version were well intentioned, but arose from a false notion of style, a deficient sense of the precision of special words, and an inadequate conception of the duties of faithful translation, which requires that we should as exactly as possible reflect the peculiarities of the original, and not attempt to improve upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who comforteth us.</span> The "us" implies here, not only St. Paul and Timothy, but also the Corinthians, who are one with them in a bond of Christian unity which was hitherto undreamed of, and was a new phenomenon in the world. St. Paul always uses the first person in passages where he is speaking directly of individual feelings and experiences. In other passages he likes to lose himself, as it were, in the Christian community. The delicate play of emotion is often shown by the rapid interchanges of singular and plural (see vers. 13, 15, 17; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1, 11, 14</a>, etc.). The present, "comforteth," expresses a continuous experience, with which the Christians of the first age were most happily familiar (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all our affliction.</span> The collective experience of affliction is sustained by the collective experience of comfort. <span class="cmt_word">That we may be able to comfort.</span> Thus St. Paul takes "a teleological view of sorrow." It is partly designed as a school of sympathy. It is a part of the training of an apostle, just as suffering is essential to one who is to be a sympathetic high priest (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In any trouble.</span> The original more forcibly repeats the words, "in all affliction." <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith we ourselves are comforted.</span> By means of the comfort which God gives <span class="accented">us</span>, we can, by the aid of blessed experience, communicate comfort to others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the sufferings of Christ abound in us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">unto us</span>. "The sufferings of Christ" are the sufferings which he endured in the days of his flesh, and they were not exhausted by him, but overflow to us who have to suffer as he suffered, bearing about with us his dying, that we may share his life (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>). The idea is, not that he is suffering in us and with us (though the truth of his intense sympathy with his suffering Church may be shadowed forth in some such terms, <a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40-45</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>), but that we have "a fellowship in his sufferings" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>); <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, "I have been crucified with Christ;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>, "Bearing his reproach." Our sufferings are the sufferings of Christ because we suffer as he suffered (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>) and in the same cause. <span class="cmt_word">Aboundeth by Christ.</span> If his sufferings, as it were, overflow to us, so too is he the Source of our comfort, in that he sendeth us the Comforter (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-6.htm">2 Corinthians 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And whether we be afflicted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. The verse expresses the additional thought that the comfort (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. encouragement and strengthening) of the apostle, as well as his affliction, was not only designed for his own spiritual training, but was the source of direct blessing to his converts, because it enabled him, both by example (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>) and by the lessons of experience, to strengthen others in affliction, and so to further their salvation by teaching them how to endure (Romans 5:34). The affliction brings encouragement, and so works  endurance in <span class="accented">us</span>, and, by our example and teaching, in <span class="accented">you</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">And our hope of you <i>is</i> stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so <i>shall ye be</i> also of the consolation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And our hope of you is steadfast;</span> literally, <span class="accented">And our hope is steadfast on your behalf</span>. The variations of text and punctuation in the verse do not materially affect the sense. The meaning is "And I have a sure hope that you will reap the benefits of our common fellowship with Christ in his affliction, and of the comfort which he sends, because I know that you have experienced the sufferings, and am therefore sure that he will send you the strength and the endurance. The close connection of tribulation and Divine encouragement are found also in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>. The interchange of the two between teacher and taught is part of the true communion of saints (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-26.htm">Philippians 2:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). Of our trouble; rather, <span class="accented">about our affliction</span>. He assumes that they are aware what the trouble was, and he does not specially mention it. What he wants them to know is that, by the help of their prayers and sympathy, God had delivered him out of this affliction, crushing as it was. <span class="cmt_word">Which came to us in Asia.</span> Most commentators refer this to the tumult at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.); and since St. Paul's dangers, sicknesses, and troubles are clearly <span class="accented">understated</span> throughout the Acts, it is possible that the perils and personal maltreatment which were liable to occur during such a season of excitement may have brought on some violent illness; or, again, be may have suffered from some plots (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, 32; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>) or shipwreck (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). In <a href="../../par/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a> he alludes again to some extreme peril. But St. Paul seems systematically to have made light of external dangers and sufferings. All his strongest expressions (see <a href="../../par/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1-3</a>, etc.) are reserved for mental anguish and affliction. What he felt most keenly was the pang of lacerated affections. It is, therefore, possible that he is here alluding to the overpowering tumult of feelings which had been aroused by his anxiety as to the reception likely to be accorded to his first letter. To this and the accompanying circumstances he alludes again and again (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>, etc.). The sense of "comfort" resulting from the tidings brought by Titus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7, 13</a>) is as strong as that expressed in these verses, and the allusion to this anguish of heart is specially appropriate here, because he is dwelling on the sympathetic communion between himself and his converts, both in their sorrows and their consolations. <span class="cmt_word">That we were pressed cut of measure, above strength;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that toe were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power</span>. The trial seemed too heavy for him to bear. The phrase here rendered "out of measure" occurs in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>; but is only found in this particular group of letters. <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that we despaired even of life.</span> This rendering conveys the meaning. Literally it is, <span class="accented">so that we were even in utter perplexity</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>) <span class="accented">even about life</span>. "I fell into such agony of mind that I hardly hoped to survive." Generally, although he was often in perplexity, he succeeded in resisting despair (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; perhaps rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>. The word strengthens the phrase, "were in utter perplexity." <span class="cmt_word">We had the sentence of death in ourselves.</span> The original is more emphatic, "Ourselves in our own selves we have had." Not only did all the outer world look dark to me, but the answer which my own spirit returned to the question," What will be the end of it all?" <span class="cmt_word">was</span> "Death!" and that doom still seems to echo in my spirit. <span class="cmt_word">The sentence</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the answer</span>.

The grace of God was the atmosphere which the apostle breathed, the sphere in which he worked. <span class="cmt_word">We have had our conversation.</span> We lived and moved. The word "conversation" originally meant "mode of life," and is used to translate both <span class="accented">anastrophe</span> and <span class="accented">politeuma</span>, which means properly "citizenship." The exclusive modern sense of "conversation" is not earlier than the last century. <span class="cmt_word">In the world;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in my general life as regards all men. <span class="cmt_word">More abundantly to you-ward.</span> Sincerity, holiness, the signs of the grace of God, were specially shown by the apostle towards the Corinthians, because they were specially needed to guide his relations towards a Church which inspired him with deep affection, but which required special wisdom to guide and govern. The fact that, in spite of all his exceptional care, such bitter taunts could still be levelled at him, shows that he had not been mistaken in supposing that no Church required from him a more anxious watchfulness over all his conduct. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we write none other things unto you,</span> etc. Remarks like these obviously presuppose that the conduct and character of St. Paul had been misrepresented and calumniated. The perpetual recurrence to a strain of self-defence would have been needless if some one - probably Titus - had not told St. Paul that his opponents accused him of <span class="accented">insincerity</span>. Here, therefore, he tells them that he is opening out his very heart towards them. What he had to say to them and of them was here set forth without any subterfuges or <span class="accented">arrieres pensees</span>. He had nothing <span class="accented">esoteric</span> which differed from <span class="accented">exoteric</span> teaching. It is a melancholy thought that even such a one as Paul was reduced to the sad necessity of defending himself against such charges as that he intrigued with individual members of his Churches, wrote private letters or sent secret messages which differed in tone from those which were read in the public assembly<span class="cmt_word">. Or acknowledge;</span> rather, <span class="accented">or even fully know</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from other sources. The paronomasia of the original cannot be preserved in English, but in Latin would be "Quae legitis aut etiam inteltigitis." <span class="cmt_word">And I trust...  even to the end</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but I hope that, even unto the end, ye will fully know - even as ye fully knew us in part - that we are your subject of boast</span>. After telling them that they have in this letter his genuine and inmost thoughts, he adds that "even as <span class="accented">some of them</span> (for this seem to be implied by the 'in part') already knew well that the mutual relations between him and them were something wherein to glory, he hopes that they will appreciate this fact, even to the end." He <span class="accented">knows</span> that <span class="accented">some</span> honour him; he hopes that all will do so; but he can only express this as a hope, for he is aware that there are calumnies abroad respecting him, so that he cannot feel sure of their unbroken allegiance. Such seems to be the meaning; but the state of mind in which St. Paul wrote has evidently troubled his style, and his expressions are less lucid and more difficult to unravel in this Epistle than in any other. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">the end</span>. The expression is quite general, like our "to the last." He does not seem <span class="accented">definitely</span> to imply either to the end of his life or to the coming of Christ, which they regarded as the end of all things, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>.

Some only of the Corinthians had been faithful to his teaching and to himself.

In ver. 12 the substantive means "the <span class="accented">act</span> of rejoicing." The word is characteristic of this group of Epistles, in which it occurs forty-six times, <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye also are ours.</span> This clause takes away all semblance of self-glorification. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a> and <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a> he expresses the natural thought that a teacher's converts are, and will be in the last day, his "crown of exultation." Here alone he implies that they may glory in him as he in them. The thought, however, so far frond being egotistical, merely indicates the in. tense intercommunion of sympathy which existed between him and them. He does  but place himself on a level with his converts, and imply that they mutually gloried in each other. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the Lord Jesus</span> (see on 1 Corinthians 3:13).

When speaking of matters purely personal, St. Paul generally reverts to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">To come unto you before.</span> I meant to visit you, first on my way to Macedonia, and again on my return from Macedonia, as explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">A second benefit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a second grace</span>. There is another reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, joy, and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> itself sometimes has this sense (as in Tobit 7:18), but not in the New Testament. Here, again, there is no boastfulness. St. Paul, filled as he was with the power of the Holy Spirit, was able to impart to his converts some spiritual gifts (<a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>), and this was the chief reason why his visits were so eagerly desired, and why his change of plan had caused such bitter disappointment to the Corinthians. The importance of the Church of Corinth, its central position, and its unsettled state made it desirable that he should give them as much as possible of his personal supervision.

The Corinthians were aware that he no longer meant to come to them direct from Ephesus. They had certainly been informed of this by Titus, and he had indeed briefly stated it in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. Their disappointment had led some of them into angry criticisms upon the "indecision" of the apostle, the more so because he had (out of kindness, as he here shows) spared them the pain of expressing his <span class="accented">reasons</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Did I use lightness?</span> Was this change of plan a sign of "the levity" with which some of you charge me? <span class="cmt_word">Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,</span> etc.? Every phrase in this clause is of ambiguous meaning. For instance, the "or" may imply <span class="accented">another</span> charge, namely, that his purposes are <span class="accented">carnal</span>, and therefore capricious; or it may be the alternative view of his conduct, stated by way of self-defence - namely, "Does my change of plan imply that I am frivolous? or, on the contrary, are not my plans of necessity mere <span class="accented">human</span> plans, and therefore liable to be overruled by God's will?" Thus the meaning of the "or" is doubtful, and also the meaning of" <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>." Generally this phrase is used in a bad sense, as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; but it may also be used to mean "in a human way," as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay.</span> There is probably no clause in the New Testament of which the certain sense must be left so indeterminate as this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Authorized Version gives one way of taking the clause. The grammar equally admits of the rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">That with me the yea should be yea, and the nay nay</span>. Whichever rendering we adept, it may be explained in accordance with the view indicated in the last note. "I was not showing the levity which my opponents speak of, but my purposes are necessarily mere human purposes, and therefore my 'yes' and 'no' can be only 'yes' and 'no' when I make a plan. My 'yes' or 'no' may be overruled by the Spirit (<a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>) or even hindered by Satan, and that more than once (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>)." "With me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as far as I am concerned, I can only say "yes" or" no;" but <span class="accented">l'homme propose, Dieu dispose</span>. His intended double visit to them was prevented, not by any frivolity of his, but, as he afterwards shows, by their own unfaithfulness and his desire to spare them. There is yet a third way of taking it which involves a different meaning - "In order that with me the 'yea yea ' may be also ' nay nay,'" Am I inconsistent? or, are my purposes merely carnal purposes, in order that my "yes yes" may be, as far as I am concerned, no better than "no no" - like the mere shifting feebleness of an aimless man? A fourth way of taking the clause, adopted by St. Chrysostom and many others, is, "Do I plan after the flesh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with carnal obstinacy, so that my ' yea' and 'nay' must be carried out at all costs?' This suggestion can hardly be right; for St. Paul was charged, not with obstinacy, but with indecision. The phrases, "yea" and "nay," as mentioned in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a> and <a href="../../par/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>, throw no light on the passage, unless indeed some one had misquoted against St. Paul our Lord's words as a reason for adhering inviolably to a plan once formed. Of these various methods I adopt the first, because it seems to be, on the whole, most in accordance with the context. For on that view of the passage he contents himself with the remark that it cannot be inconsistency or levity on his part to alter plans which are liable to all the chance and change of ordinary circumstances; and then tells them that there was one part of his teaching which has nothing to do with mere human weakness, but was God's everlasting , "yes;" after which he explains to them the reason why he decided not to come to them until he had first visited Macedonia, and so to give them one visit, not two.

In that, at any rate, there was nothing capricious, nothing variable, nothing vacillating. St. Paul, in a manner characteristic to his moods of deepest emotion, "goes off at a word." The Corinthians talked of his "yea" and "nay" as though one was little better than the other, and neither could be depended on; well, at any rate, <span class="accented">one thing</span>, and that the most essential, was as sure as the faithfulness of God.

"Silvanus" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>) is the "Silas" of <a href="../../par/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>.

The word <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, rendered "earnest," has an interesting history.

In classical Latin it is shortened into <span class="accented">arrha</span>, and it still exists in Italian as <span class="accented">aura</span>, in French as <span class="accented">arrhes</span>.

At this point, to <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>, he enters for the first time on the kindly reasons which had led him to forego his intended earlier visit. He uses a similar adjuration in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; and although these appeals  (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>) may be due in part to the emotional fervour of his temperament, yet he would hardly have resorted to them in this self defence, if the calumnies of his enemies had not gained much credence. The French proverb, <span class="accented">Qui s'excuse s'accuse</span>, is often grossly abused.

By the use of such "oaths for confirmation," St. Paul, no less than other apostles, shows that he understood our Lord's rule, "Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay," as applying to the principle of simple and unvarnished truthfulness of intercourse, which requires no further confirmation; but not as a rigid exclusion of the right to appeal to God in solemn cases and for good reasons. <span class="cmt_word">To spare you.</span> This postponement of the intended visit was a sign of .<span class="accented">forbearance</span>, for which they should have been grateful.

The division of chapters is here unfortunate, since this and the next three verses belong to the paragraph which began at <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>.  The verb means, literally, "I judged," but is rightly rendered "determined," as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>.

There have been interminable discussions, founded on this expression and on ch. 13:1, as to whether St. Paul had up to the time of writing this letter visited Corinth <span class="accented">twice</span> or only <span class="accented">once</span>. There is no question that only one visit is recorded in the Acts (Acts 18:1-18) previous to the one which he paid to this Church after this Epistle had been sent (<a href="../../par/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 3</a>). If he paid them a second brief, sad, and unrecorded visit, it can only have been during his long stay in Ephesus (<a href="../../par/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8, 10</a>). But the possibility of this does not seem to be recognized in <a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, where he speaks of his work at Ephesus "night and day" during this period. The assumption of such a visit, as we shall see, is not necessitated by <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>, but in any case we know nothing whatever about the details of the visit, even if there was one, and the question, being supremely unimportant, is hardly worth the time which has been spent upon it. If he <span class="accented">had</span> paid such a visit, it would be almost unaccountable that there should be no reference to it in the First Epistle, and here in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> he refers only to one occasion on which he had preached Christ in Corinth. Each fresh review of the circumstances convinces me more strongly that the notion of <span class="accented">three</span> visits to Corinth, of which one is unrecorded, is a needless and mistaken inference, due to unimaginative literalism in interpreting one or two phrases, and encumbered with difficulties on every side. In <span class="accented">heaviness</span>. The expression applies as much to the Corinthians as to himself, he did not wish his second visit to Corinth to be a painful one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-2.htm">2 Corinthians 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if I make you sorry.</span> The verse may be rendered. "For if I pain you, who then is it that gladdens me except he who is being pained by me?" The "<span class="accented">I"</span> being expressed in the original, is emphatic, and the verse has none of the strange selfish meaning which has been assigned to <span class="accented">it</span>, namely, that St. Paul thought "the grief which he had caused to be amply compensated for by the pleasure he received from that grief." It has the much simpler meaning that he was unwilling to pain those who gladdened him, and therefore would not pay them a visit which could only be <span class="accented">painful</span> on both sides, when the normal relation between them should be one of <span class="accented">joy</span> on both sides, as he has already said (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-24.htm">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>). The singular, "he who is being pained by me<span class="accented"></span>," does not refer to the offender, but to the Corinthians collectively. <span class="cmt_word">Who is he then,</span> etc.? The "then" in the original is classically and elegantly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">and</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-4.htm">James 2:4</a>).

He meets the tacit objection. If you shrink from causing us pain, why then did you write to us in terms so severe? The "I wrote" may be what is called the epistolary aorist, and will then be equivalent to our "I write:" "What I <span class="accented">write</span> to you now has the very object of sparing you a painful visit." If the aorist has its more ordinary sense, it refers to the First, and not to the present Epistle; and this seems the better view, for the "I wrote" in ver. 9 certainly refers to the First Epistle. <span class="accented">This same thing</span>; namely, exactly what I have written (whether in this or in the former Epistle). The words, "this very thing," may also, in the original, menu "for this very reason," as in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>, and like the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in ver. 9. <span class="accented">Unto you</span>. These words should be omitted, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C. <span class="cmt_word">When I came.</span> The emphasis lies in these words. He preferred that his letter, rather than his personal visit, should cause pain. In you all. It is true that in the Corinthian Church St. Paul had bitter and unscrupulous opponents, but he will not believe even that they desired his personal unhappiness. At any rate, if there were any such, he will net believe that they exist, since "love believeth all things, hopeth all things" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. He proceeds to assign the anguish which his First Epistle had caused him as a proof of his confidence that, as a body, they loved him as he loved them. If they had regarded each other with indifference, his letter would not have been written to them, as it were. in his heart's blood. Out of much affliction and anguish of heart. The word for "anguish" means "contraction," "pressure," "spasm" (<a href="../../par/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>). The expression may seem far too strong to be accounted for by the tone of the first letter. Hence some have supposed that he is referring to some other letter now last; and others that ch. 10-13. of this letter, where the whole tone of affection and tenderness suddenly changes into one of impassioned irony and indignation, really belonged to this intermediate letter. There is no need, however, for these hypotheses. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-6:11</a> he had spoken of the errors of the Church with strong reprobation, and the anguish with which he wrote the letter may have been all the more deeply felt because,  in expressing it, he put on his feelings a strong restraint. <span class="cmt_word">With many tears.</span> I wrote "out of" anguish, and that anguish showed itself through the tears which bathed my cheeks as I wrote. Such tears, says Calvin, "show weakness, but a weakness more heroic than would have been the iron apathy of a Stoic." It must, however, be remembered that, in ancient times, and in Southern and Eastern lands, men yielded to tears more readily than among Northern nations, who take pride in suppressing as far as possible all outward signs of emotion. In Homer the bravest heroes do not blush to weep in public, and the nervous, afflicted temperament of St. Paul seems to have been often overwhelmed with weeping (<a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-4.htm">2 Timothy 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not that ye should be grieved.</span> The "not," by a common Hebrew idiom, means "not only," "not exclusively." His object in inflicting pain was not the pain itself, but the results of godly repentance which it produced (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The love.</span> In the Greek this word is placed very emphatically at the beginning of the clause. <span class="cmt_word">More abundantly.</span> I loved you <span class="accented">more</span> than I loved other converts, and the abundance of my love will give you a measure of the pain I felt. The Philippians were St. Paul's best-beloved converts; but next to them he seems to have felt more personal tenderness for the members of this inflated, wayward, erring Church than for any other community, just as a father sometimes loves best his least-deserving son. There was something in the brightness and keenness of the Greek nature which won over St. Paul, in spite of its many faults. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">2 Corinthians 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> <span class="accented">- The results of his letter in their treatment of the incestuous offender</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if any have caused grief.</span> The word "pain" or "grief" which has been so prominent in the last verses, naturally reminds St. Paul of the person whose misdoings had caused all this trouble. The "any" is in the singular. <span class="cmt_word">He hath not grieved me, but in part,</span> etc. Of the various ways of taking this verse, the most tenable seems to be this: "If any one has caused pain, he has not pained <span class="accented">me</span> but partly (not to weigh down too heavily) <span class="accented">all</span> of you. St. Paul is denying that the feelings with which he hat(written his severe letter were due to mere personal sorrow or indignation. In writing he felt for the wrong done to <span class="accented">them</span>, to the whole Corinthian Church, at least as much as for the smart of his own grief and disappointment. The word "partly" is introduced, as St. Chrysostom says, to soften the expression, "he has grieved <span class="accented">you all</span>." It will then mean "to a certain extent." The words, "that I may not overcharge," or rather, as in the Revised Version, "that I press not too heavily," assign the reason for the modifying clause, "in part." When St. Paul says that this man's conduct had <span class="accented">even</span> to <span class="accented">any extent</span> grieved the whole community, his words may seem to conflict with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; but he is thinking, not of the immediate condonation of the offender there alluded to, but of the agony of subsequent repentance which his letter had awoke in the whole (or practically the whole) community (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). The phrase, "that I press not too heavily," refers then to the offender: "I will not say outright that he has grieved not <span class="accented">me, but all of you</span>, because I do not wish to bear too hard on him" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), "but I will say that he has grieved you and me alike to some extent." The phrase, "in part," occurs also in <a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>.

But this handing over to Satan was, as we have seen, designed solely for a merciful purpose, and to awaken his repentance, so as to secure his ultimate salvation (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4, 5</a>). Whether the Corinthians had done exactly as St. Paul bade them is uncertain; but whatever they had done is here acquiesced in by St. Paul, and even if (as we may suspect) they had dealt more leniently with the offender than he originally intended, he here not only refrains from urging them to use greater severity, but even exhorts them to a still more absolute condonation. St. Paul's object had not been that they should take a particular course of action, but that they should bring about a desired result. The result had been achieved, and now the matter might rest. <span class="accented">To such a man</span>. St. Paul mercifully abstains from recording his name or from thrusting him into unnecessary prominence before the assembly in which the letter would be read. The apostle evidently entered into the Jewish feeling that there is a criminal cruelty in needlessly calling a blush of shame into a brother's face. <span class="accented">This punishment</span>. The word <span class="accented">epitimia</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, but is also found in Wisd. 3:10, means "punishment," as in later Greek, and is not used in its classical sense of "rebuke" (Vulgate, <span class="accented">objurgatio</span>); but the mildness of the word, perhaps, implies that the Corinthians had not resorted to the severest measures. <span class="cmt_word">Which was inflicted of many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by the majority</span>. The verb is expressed in the original, and St. Paul seems to allude to the steps taken, whatever they were, with a certain dignified reticence. It is obvious that there were still some opponents of St. Paul in the Church, who  retained in this matter their "inflated" sentiments of spurious independence; and this may, perhaps, have driven others into too rigid an attitude of severity.

In <a href="../../par/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a> St. Paul suddenly breaks off the course of his remarks to give similar advice in a tone of peculiar solemnity; and in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a> he warns against any <span class="accented">excess</span> in the severity which he enjoins in the previous verse. <span class="cmt_word">Such a one</span>.

It would, perhaps, be pressing it too much to imply that their "forgiveness" showed that they had not accurately stood the test of perfect obedience; yet it is difficult to read the whole passage without suspecting that St. Paul, while by temperament he leaned to the side of mercy, is here showing a spirit of generous self-suppression m accepting the course which the Corinthians had followed, although it had, in some way or other, diverged from his exact directions. <span class="accented">To whom</span>, Obviously, again, a purposely indefinite reference to the incestuous person. <span class="cmt_word">I forgive also.</span> The power of "binding" and "loosing," of "forgiving" and "retaining," had only been given to the apostles representatively and collectively, and therefore to the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>) in its corporate capacity.

The order of the words also varies. The best reading seems to be expressed by the version, "For what I also have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything (I have pardoned it) for your sakes." This represents the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, F, G, etc., and is followed by the Revised Version. There seems to be here an intentional vagueness, and reference to circumstances of which we are not informed, which might, perhaps, have given room for wounded feelings in any one less magnanimous than St. Paul. The line he took in this matter was taken for their sakes - that is all he says, he adopted it as the best <span class="accented">relatively</span>, whether it was <span class="accented">absolutely</span> the best or not. <span class="cmt_word">In the person of Christ;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the face of Christ</span>; which seems to mean "in the presence of Christ," as though he were looking on at what I did (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 13, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>). It may be doubted whether the word <span class="accented">prosopon</span> ever means "person" in the New Testament, except in a secondary sense.

There is an apparently abrupt transition, but the apostle is only resuming the narrative which he broke off at ver. 4 in order that he might finish the topic of the painful circumstance in which his First Epistle had originated. <span class="accented">To Troas</span>. Not "the Troas." St. Paul had to do with the city, not with the district. The city (now <span class="accented">Eski Stamboul</span>), of which the name had been changed from <span class="accented">Antigonia Troas</span> to <span class="accented">Alexandria Troas</span>, was at this time a flourishing colony (<span class="accented">Colonia Juris Italici</span>), highly favoured by the Romans as representing ancient Troy, and therefore as being the mythological cradle of their race. He visited it on his being driven from Ephesus  after the tumult, a little earlier than he would naturally have left it. He had visited Troas in his second missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8-11</a>), but had left it in consequence of the vision which called him to Macedonia. He now stopped there on his journey through Macedonia to Corinth, which he had announced in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And a door was opened unto me of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and a door had been opened to me in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and I found there a marked opportunity (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>) for work in Christ. Some commentators, in that spirit of superfluous disquisition and idle letter-worship which is the bane of exegesis, here venture to discuss whether St. Paul was justified in neglecting this opportunity or not. Such discussions are only originated by not observing characteristic modes of expression. St. Paul merely means" circumstances would <span class="accented">otherwise</span> have been very favourable for my preaching of Christ; but I was in such a state of miserable anxiety that I lacked the strength to avail myself of them." He was no more responsible for this state of mind, which belonged to his natural temperament, than he would have been responsible for a serious illness. To say that he <span class="accented">ought</span> to have had strength of mind enough to get the mastery over his feelings is only to say that Paul ought not to have been Paul. The neglect to use the opportunity was a "hindrance" which might in one sense be assigned to God, and in another to Satan. Moreover, that the opportunity was <span class="accented">not</span> wholly lost appears from the fact that St. Paul found a flourishing Christian community at Troas when he visit, d it on his return from this very journey (<a href="../../par/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6, 7</a>), and that he stayed there at least once again, shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a>). Indeed, it was probably at Troas that his <span class="accented">final</span> arrest took place (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:569, 576). <span class="accented">Of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sphere of Christian work.

The perfect vividly realizes the scene through which he had passed. I had no rest. St. Paul had evidently told Titus to come from his mission to Corinth and meet him at Troas. But either St. Paul reached the town earlier than he intended, or Titus had been delayed. Now, the apostle was so intensely eager to know how his rebukes had been received - the name of "Corinth" was so deeply engraven on his heart - he could so ill endure the thought of being on angry terms with converts which he so deeply loved, that the non-appearance of Titus filled him with devouring anxiety and rendered him incapable of any other work. <span class="cmt_word">In my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to my spirit</span>. It was the loftiest part of St. Paul's nature  - his spirit - which was utterly incapacitated from effort by the restlessness of his miserable uncertainty about the Corinthian Church. The disclosure of such feelings ought to have had a powerful influence on the Corinthians. We see from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5, 9</a> that St. Paul yearned for tidings of his converts with an intensity which can hardly be realized by less fervent and self-devoted natures. <span class="cmt_word">I found not Titus my brother.</span> Not only "<span class="accented">the</span> brother," but "<span class="accented">my</span> brother;" the man whom in matters of this kind I most trusted as an affectionate and able fellow worker (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Titus, though not mentioned in the Acts, is the most prominent person in this Epistle, and it is evident that St. Paul felt for him a warm affection and respect (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Taking my leave of them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Christians in Troas.

He had doubtless told Titus to look out for him at Philippi, and expected to meet him there on his way to Troas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now thanks <i>be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now thanks be unto God.</span> The whole of this Epistle is the apostle's <span class="accented">Apologia pro vita sua</span>, and is more full of personal details and emotional expressions than any other Epistle. But nothing in it is more characteristic than this sudden outburst of thanksgiving into which he breaks so eagerly <span class="accented">that he has quite omitted to say what it was for which he so earnestly thanked God</span>. It is only when we come to <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5, 6</a> that we learn the circumstance which gave him such intense relief, namely, the arrival of Titus with good news from Corinth about the treatment of the offender and the manner in which the first letter had been received. It is true that this good news seems to have been dashed by other remarks of Titus which, perhaps, he withheld at first, and which may only have been drawn from him, almost against his will, by subsequent conversations. But, however checkered, the main and immediate intelligence was good, and the apostle so vividly recalls his sudden uplifting out of an abyss of anxiety and trouble (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>) that the mere remembrance of it awakens a thankfulness to God which can only find vent by immediate utterance. <span class="accented">Now thanks be unto God</span>. The order of the original is more forcible, "But to God be thanks." The remembrance of his own prostration calls into his mind the power and love of God. <span class="cmt_word">Which always causeth us to triumph;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who leadeth us in triumph</span>. The verb <span class="accented">thriambeuo</span> may undoubtedly have this meaning, on the analogy of <span class="accented">choreuo</span>, I cause to dance, <span class="accented">basileuo</span>, I cause to reign, etc.; and other neuter verbs  which sometimes have a factitive scribe. But in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> St. Paul uses this word in the only sense in which it is actually found, "to <span class="accented">lead</span> in <span class="accented">triumph</span>;" and this sense seems both to suit the context better, and to be more in accordance with the habitual feelings of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>), and especially those with which these Epistles were written (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>). St. Paul's feeling is, therefore, the exact opposite of that of the haughty Cleopatra who said, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I will not be led in triumph." He rejoiced to be exhibited by God as a trophy in the triumphal procession of Christ. God, indeed, gave him the victory over the lower part of his nature (<a href="../../par/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>), but this was no public triumph. The only victory of which he could boast was to have been utterly vanquished by God and taken prisoner "in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">The savour of his knowledge.</span> The mental vision of a Roman triumph summons up various images before the mind of St. Paul. He thinks of the streets breathing with the fragrance of incense offered upon many a wayside altar; of the tumult and rejoicing of the people; of the fame and glory of the conqueror; of the miserable captives led aside from the funeral procession to die, like Vercingetorix, in the <span class="accented">Tullianum</span> at the foot of the Capitoline hill. He touches on each of these incidents as they crowd upon him. The triumph of L. Mummius over the conquest of Corinth had been one of the most splendid which the Roman world had ever seen, and in A.D. , shortly before this Epistle was written (A.D. 57), Claudius had celebrated his triumph over the Britons and their king Caractacus, who had been led in the procession, but whose life had been spared (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 13:36). <span class="accented">The savour of his knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">By us.</span> The details of the metaphor are commingled, as is often the case in writers of quick feeling and imagination. Here the apostles are no longer the vanquished who are led in procession, but the spectators who burn and diffuse the fragrance of the incense<span class="cmt_word">. In every place.</span> Even at that early period, not twenty-five years after the Crucifixion, the gospel had been very widely preached in Asia and Europe (<a href="../../par/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18, 19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ.</span> The undeveloped metaphor involved in these words is that "we and our preaching diffuse to God's glory the knowledge of Christ which is as a sweet savour." The apostles are identified with their work; they were as the incense, crushed and burned, but diffusing everywhere a waft of perfume. St. Paul is still thinking of the incense burnt in the streets of Rome during a triumph - "Dabimusque Divis Tura benignis" (Horace, 'Od.,' 4:2.51) - though his expression recalls the "odour of a sweet smell," of <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>); see on this passage the excellent note of Bishop Wordsworth. <span class="cmt_word">In them that are saved, and in them that perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among those who are perishing and those who are being saved</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>).

To those who are perishing, the incense of the Name of Christ which our work enables them to breathe, seems to rise from death, and to lead to death. They (for here again the outlines of the metaphor shift) are like the doomed captives, who, as they breathed the incense on the day of triumph, knew where that triumph would lead them before the victors can climb the Capitol. To them it would seem to bring with it not "airs from heaven," but wafts from the abyss. So Christ was alike for the fall and for the rising again of many (<a href="../../par/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>). To some he was a Stone of stumbling (<a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>), which grinds to powder those on whom it falls (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). This contrast between the intended effect of the gospel as the power and wisdom of God, and its <span class="accented">accidental</span> effect, through man's sin and blindness which converts it into a source of judgment, is often alluded to in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18, 23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>, etc.). St. Paul is fond of intensified expressions, like "from death unto death," as in <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; "from faith to faith," etc. (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Savour of life unto life;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a savour from life</span>, as before. It came from the Source of life; it is issued in the sole reality of life. Similarly the rabbis spoke of the Law as "an aroma" alike of death and of life. "Why are the words of the Law likened to princes (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>)? Because, like princes, <span class="accented">they have the power to kill and to give life</span>.

All Christian privileges are, as they are used, either blessings or banes (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And who is sufficient for these things?</span> St. Paul always implies that nothing but the grace of God could enable him to discharge the great duty laid upon him (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).

This clause is introduced to show how much courage and effort the work requires. "The many" might, by Greek idiom, mean "the majority." The apparent harshness of the assertion that the majority of teachers in the apostolic age  dealt untruly with the Word of God, led to the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, the rest, in some manuscripts (D, E, F, G, L). But "the many" here means "the many antagonists of mine," who preach a different gospel (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). It must be remembered that conceit, Pharisaism, moral laxity, and factions were all at work in the Corinthian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Which corrupt.</span> The Word means who are merely" trafficking with," "adulterating<span class="accented"></span>," "huckstering<span class="accented"></span>," the Word of life. The word occurs in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; Ecclus. 26:29; and Plato applies the same metaphor to the sophists, who peddle their wisdom about ('Protag.,' p. 313 d). The substantive <span class="accented">kapelos</span> means "a retail dealer," and especially a vintner, and the verb <span class="accented">kapeleuo is</span> always used in a bad sense, like the English "to huckster." Such deceitful dealers with the gospel are described in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>, and in one of the Ignatian letters they are called <span class="accented">Christemporoi</span>, Christ-traffickers.

He anticipates the malignant and meaning smiles with which they would hear such words. The word "again" implies that this charge had already been brought against him, perhaps in consequence of such passages as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-18.htm">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>, etc. Such passages might be called self-laudatory and egotistical, were it not that (as St. Paul here explains) they arose only from a sense of the grandeur of his office, of which he was the almost involuntary agent, used by God as it seemed best to him. Hence he says later on (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7</a>:18) that self-praise is no commendation, and that the true test of a man is God's commendation.

The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, thus translated, is better supported than <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, unless, which would have a somewhat ironical force. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> implies, "Can you possibly think that we need," etc.? Generally, when a stranger came to some Church to which he was not personally known, he carried with him some credentials in the form of letters from accredited authorities. St. Paul treats it as absurd to suppose that he or Timothy should need such letters, either <span class="accented">from</span> the Corinthians or to them. <span class="cmt_word">As some</span>. He will not name them, but he refers to the Judaists, who vaunted of their credentials in order to disparage St. Paul, who was too great to need and too independent to use them. We can hardly, perhaps, realize the depth and bitterness of antagonism concealed under that word "some" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18</a> <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>. It is not meant that there was anything discreditable in using such letters (for Apollos had used them, <a href="../../par/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>), but the disgraceful thing was that St. Paul should be disparaged for not bringing them. <span class="cmt_word">Epistles of commendation.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "introductory letters" - was familiar in later Greek. In days when there were few public hostels, and when it was both a duty and a necessity for small and persecuted communities like those of the Jews and Christians to practise hospitality (<a href="../../par/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. etc.), it was customary both for synagogues and Churches to provide their friends and emissaries with authentic testimonials. Otherwise they might have been deceived by wandering impostors, as, in fact, the Christians were deceived by the vagabond quack Peregrinus. We can easily see how the custom of using such letters might be abused by idle, restless, and intriguing persons, who have never found it very difficult to procure them. We find traces of their <span class="accented">honest</span> use by Phoebe, by Silas and Jude, by Apollos, by Mark, and by Zenas, in <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and of their unfair use by certain Judaists, in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> and Galatians 2:12. Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the necessity for St. Paul's protest against the idle vaunt of possessing such letters, than the fact that, <span class="accented">more than a century afterwards</span>, we find malignant innuendoes aimed at St. Paul in the pseudo-Clementines, under the name of" the enemy" and "Simon Magus" and "a deceiver." He is there spoken of as using letters from the high priest (which, indeed, St. Paul had done as Saul of Tarsus, <a href="../../par/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1, 2</a>); and the Churches are warned never to receive any one who cannot bring credentials from James; so deep-rooted among the Judaists was the antagonism to the independent apostolate and daring originality of the apostle of the Gentiles! Dr. Plumptre quotes Sozomen ('H.E.', 5:16) for the curious fact that the Emperor Julian tried to introduce the system of "commendatory letters" into his revived paganism. <span class="cmt_word">Or letters of commendation from you.</span> The substitution of "letters" for "epistles" is an instance of the almost childish fondness for unnecessary synonyms, which is one of the defects of the Authorized Version. The true reading probably is "to you or from you" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C). The word "commendatory" (<span class="accented">sustatikon</span>) is omitted in A, B, C. <span class="accented">Or from you</span>. It was worse than absurd to suppose that St. Paul should need those <span class="accented">literae formatae</span> to a Church of which he was the thunder; and nothing but the boundless "inflation" which characterized the Corinthians could have led them to imagine that he needed letters <span class="accented">from</span> them to other Churches, as though, forsooth, they were the primary Church or the only church (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-36.htm">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>).

The development of the metaphor <span class="accented">as a metaphor</span> would be somewhat clumsy and intricate, but St. Paul only cares to shadow forth the essential fact which he wishes them to recognize. Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not with visible or perishable materials, but spiritual in its origin and character. The notion of "the finger of God" naturally recalled the notion of "the Spirit of God" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a> with <a href="../../par/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>).

St. Paul is thinking of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, "I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;" and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>, "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh." The tablets were not hard and fragile, but susceptible and receptive.

The "new testament" has not the remotest connection with what we call "The New Testament," meaning thereby the book - which, indeed, had at this time no existence. The word "testament" means a will, and in this sense implies neither the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span> nor the Greek <span class="accented">diatheke</span>, both of which mean "covenant." In one passage only of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16, 17</a>) does <span class="accented">diatheke</span> mean a "testament" or "will." For the thought, see <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not of the letter, but of the spirit.</span> In other words, "not of the Law, but of the gospel;" not of that which is dead, but of that which is living; not of that which is deathful, but of that which is life-giving; not of bondage, but of freedom; not of mutilation, but of self-control; not of the outward, but of the inward; not of works, but of grace; not of menace, but of promise; not of curse, but of blessing; not of wrath, but of love; not of Moses, but of Christ. This is the theme which St. Paul develops especially in the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians (see <a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Not of the letter</span>. Not, that is, of the Mosaic Law regarded as a yoke of externalism; a hard and unhelpful "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not;" a system that possessed no life of its own and inspired no life into others; a "categoric imperative," majestic, indeed, but unsympathetic and pitiless. Both the Law and the gospel were <span class="accented">committed to writing</span>; each covenant had its own <span class="accented">book</span>; but in the case of the Mosaic Law there was the book and nothing more; in the case of the gospel the book was nothing compared to the spirit, and nothing without the spirit. <span class="accented">Out of the spirit</span>. That is, of the gospel which found its pledge and consummation in the gift of the Spirit. The Law, too, was in one sense "spiritual" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>), for it was given by God, who is a Spirit, and it was a holy Law; but though such in itself (<span class="accented">in se</span>) it was relatively (<span class="accented">per aceidens</span>) a cause of sin and death, because it was addressed to a fallen nature, and inspired no spirit by which that nature could be delivered (see  <a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-25</a>). But in the gospel the spirit is everything; the mere letter is as nothing (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span> This is one of the very numerous "texts" which have been first misinterpreted and have then been made, for whole centuries, the bases of erroneous systems. On this text more than any other, Origen, followed by the exegetes of a thousand years, built his dogma that the Scripture must be interpreted allegorically, not literally, because "the letter" of the Bible kills. The misinterpretation is extravagantly inexcusable, and, like many others, arose solely from rending words away from their context and so reading new senses into them. The contrast is not between "the outward" and the inward sense of Scripture at all. "The letter" refers exclusively to "the Law," and therefore has so little reference to "the Bible" that it was written before most of the New Testament existed, and only touches on a small portion of the Old Testament. <span class="accented">Killeth</span>. Two questions arise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What</span> and <span class="accented">whom</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">how</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The answers seem to be that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the letter - the Law regarded as an outward letter - passes the sentence of <span class="accented">death on those who disobey it</span>. It says, "He who doeth these things shall live in them;" and therefore implies, as well as often says, that he who disobeys them shall be cut off. It is, therefore, a deathful menace. For none <span class="accented">can</span> obey this Law with perfect obedience. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sting of death being sin, the Law kills by directly leading to sin, in that it stirs into existence the principle of concupiscence (<a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="accented">But the spirit giveth life</span>. This contrast between a dead and a living covenant is fundamental, and especially in the writings of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-8.htm">Galatians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The Law stones the adulteress; the gospel says to her, "Go, and sin no more." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">But if the ministration of death, written <i>and</i> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <i>glory</i> was to be done away:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ministration of death.</span> The ministration, that is, of the Law, of "the letter which killeth." St. Paul here begins one of the arguments <span class="accented">a minori ad majus</span> which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Written and engraven in stones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">engraved in letters on stones</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The reference shows that, in speaking of "the letter," St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. <span class="cmt_word">Was glorious;</span> literally, <span class="accented">occurred in glory</span>, or, <span class="accented">proved itself glorious</span>. In itself the Law was "holy, just, and good" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), and given "at the disposition of angels" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not "behold" the face of Moses is the <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, or traditional legend, derived from <a href="../../par/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, which says that "they were afraid to <span class="accented">draw nigh</span> to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -<br />Thy words and saints to know;<br />To pierce the veil on Moses' face,<br />Although his words be slow."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Because of the glory of his countenance.</span> This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for "a ray of light" and "a horn" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was "irradiated," the Vulgate says, <span class="accented">Cornnta erat ejus facies</span>; and even in our version of <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> we find "And he had <span class="accented">horns</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand." To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory was to be done away.</span> The Greek might be expressed by "the glory - the evanescing glory  - of his countenance." It was not "to <span class="accented">be</span> done away," but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb "to do away," implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now "antiquated" and "near its obliteration" (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in <a href="../../par/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>.

In other words, the glory of Mosaism is so completely outdazzled by the splendour of the gospel, that, relatively speaking, it has no glory left; the moon and the stars cease to shine, they "pale their ineffectual fires" when the sun is in the zenith.

And here the image of "the veil" as completely seizes St. Paul's imagination as the image of the letter does in the first verses. <span class="cmt_word">Put a veil;</span> literally, <span class="accented">was putting</span>, or, <span class="accented">used to put</span>, a veil on his face when he had finished speaking to the people. <span class="cmt_word">That the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that the children of Israel might not gaze on the end of what was passing away</span>. The object of the veil, according to St. Paul, was to prevent the Israelites from gazing on <span class="accented">the last gleam of the covenant</span>. In other words, he did not wish them to be witnesses of a <span class="accented">fading</span> glory. It is preposterous to imagine that St. Paul is here casting any blame on the conduct of Moses, as though he acted fraudulently or delusively. Moses was aware, and even told the people, float his legislation was not final (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15 -19</a>), but it would be quite natural that he should not wish the people to witness the gradual dimming of the lustre which, in St. Paul's view, was typical of that transitoriness. It seems, however, that St. Paul is here either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> following a different reading or rendering of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is adopting some Jewish <span class="accented">hagadah</span>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is giving his own turn to the narrative, as the rabbis habitually did, by way of <span class="accented">midrash</span>, or exposition. For from the narrative of Exodus we should not gather that it was the object of Moses to hide the disappearance of the splendour, but rather to render the light endurable. In our Authorized Version the verse runs, "till Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face;" but the meaning of the original may be, "after he had done speaking with them," as the LXX. takes it and the Vulgate. <span class="accented">The end</span>. To interpret this of <span class="accented">Christ</span>, because of <a href="../../par/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>, is an instance of the superstitious and unintelligent way in which systems are made out of a mosaic of broken texts. The foolish character of the interpretation is shown when we consider that it involves the inference that Moses put a veil on his face in order to prevent the Israelites from seeing Christi But this attempt to illustrate Scripture by catching at a similar, expression applied in a wholly different way in another part of Scripture, is one of the normal follies of scriptural interpretation.

It would be equally correct to say by themselves (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8</a>), or by Satan (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), or by God (<a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same veil.</span> Of course the meaning is "a veil of which the veil of Moses is an exact type." The veil which prevented them from seeing the evanescence of the light which shone on the face of Moses was symbolically identical  with that which prevented them also from seeing the transitory character of his Law. It had been as it were taken from his face and laid on their hearts (see <a href="../../par/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>.). Many commentators have seen in this verse a reference to the Jewish custom of covering the head with the <span class="accented">tallith</span>, a four-cornered veil, when they were in the synagogues. But this is doubtful, since the <span class="accented">tallith</span> did not cover the eyes. More probably his metaphor may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, "And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast ever all people, and <span class="accented">the veil</span> that is spread over all nations." <span class="cmt_word">Untaken away.</span> There are two other ways of rendering this verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which veil is done away in Christ," as in the Revised Version; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it is done away in Christ," as it is taken by Chrysostom and many others, and in the margin of the Revised Version. The latter seems to be the better view. It is not the veil, but the old covenant, which is being done away in Christ. To the Jews that truth still remained under a veil. The present tense, "is <span class="accented">in course</span> of annulment," might naturally be used until the utter abrogation of even the possible fulfilment of the Mosaic Law at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">In the reading of the old testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the old covenant</span>. There is no allusion to the Old Testament as a <span class="accented">book</span>, but the phrase is equivalent to "Moses is read" in the next verse. (On this obduracy of the Jews, see <a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8, 25</a>.)

The verb may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/exodus/34-31.htm">Exodus 34:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be taken away;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is in course of removal</span>.

To whom shall they turn? To the Lord. "But the Lord is the Spirit." The word "spirit" could not be introduced thus abruptly and vaguely; it must refer to something already said, and therefore to the last mention of the word "spirit" in ver. 3. The Lord is the Spirit, who giveth life and freedom, in antithesis to the spirit of death and legal bondage (see ver. 6; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The best comment on the verse is <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>, "For the law of the <span class="accented">spirit of life in Christ Jesus</span> hath made me free from the law of sin and death." All life and all religion had become to St. Paul a vision of all things in Christ. He has just said that the spirit giveth life, and, after the digression about the moral blindness which prevented the Jews from being emancipated from the bondage of the letter, it was quite natural for him to add, "Now the Lord <span class="accented">is</span> the Spirit to which I alluded." The connection in which the verse stands excludes a host of untenable meanings which have been attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">There is liberty.</span> The liberty of confidence (ver. 4), and of frank speech (ver. 12), and of sonship (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>), and of freedom from guilt (<a href="../../par/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>); so that the Law itself, obeyed no longer in the mere letter but also in the spirit, becomes a royal law of liberty, and not a yoke which gendereth to bondage (<a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12</a>) - a service, indeed, but one which is perfect freedom (<a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).

No other instance occurs in which the verb in the middle voice has the meaning of "reflecting," and the words, "With unveiled face," imply the image of "beholding." They are, in fact, a description of "the beatific vision." An additional reason for retaining the translation of our Authorized Version is that the verb is used in <span class="accented">this</span> sense by Philo ('Leg. Alleg.,' 3:33). <span class="cmt_word">The glory of the Lord.</span> Namely, him who is "the Effulgence of God's glory" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), the true Shechinah, "the Image of the invisible God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are changed into the same image.</span> The present tense implies a <span class="accented">gradual</span> transfiguration, a mystical and spiritual change which is produced in us while we contemplate Christ. <span class="cmt_word">From glory to glory.</span> Our spiritual assimilation to Christ comes <span class="accented">from</span> his glory and issues in a glory like his (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; comp." from strength to  strength," <a href="../../par/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>). (For the thought, comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.) As by the Spirit of the Lord. This rendering (which is that of the Vulgate also) can hardly be correct.

No such abstract theological thought is here in his mind as that of the "<span class="accented">hypostatic</span> union," of the Son and the Holy Spirit. He is still referring to the contrast between the letter and the spirit, and his identification of this "spirit" in its highest sense with the quickening life which, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we receive from Christ, and which is indeed identical with "the Spirit of Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_corinthians/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Corinthians 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_corinthians/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Corinthians 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Corinthians 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm"><title>2 Corinthians 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_corinthians/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_corinthians/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_corinthians/3.htm" title="2 Corinthians 3">&#9668;</a> 2 Corinthians 4 <a href="../2_corinthians/5.htm" title="2 Corinthians 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>.

He has spoken of "manifestation of the truth," and yet has spoken of all Jews as unable to see it because they will not remove from their hearts the veil which hides it from them. How can "a veiled gospel" be a "manifested truth"? The answer is that the gospel is bright, but the eyes that should gaze on it are wilfully closed. Similarly in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>, he has compared the gospel to a fragrance of life, yet to the doomed captives - "to the perishing"  - it comes "like a waft from the charnel house."

The melancholy attempt to get rid of Manichean arguments by rendering the verse "in whom God blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers of this world" is set aside by the fact that the terrible description of Satan as "another god" (<span class="accented">El acheer</span>) was common among the rabbis. They knew that his power was indeed a derivative power, trot still that it was permitted to be great (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).

The verb here has no other meaning than "to blind," and is quite different from the verb "to harden," rendered by "to blind" in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> with the same substantive. They are blind from lack of faith, and so being "unbelieving" they are" perishing" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>), seeing that they "walk in darkness" (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and are in Satan's power (<a href="../../par/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>).

There is an implied comparison between the creation of light and the dawn of the gospel light, and each of these was meant for the good of all the world. The verse should be rendered, if we follow the best manuscripts, "Because it is God, who said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God." <span class="cmt_word">In the face of Jesus Christ</span> (see ch. 2:10; 3:7).

But when he takes the Word of life from the earthen pitcher and waves it in the air, it illuminates all on whom the light shines. No commentator seems to have seen the probable allusion to Gideon's pitchers. It is the "light," of which he has been speaking exclusively in the last verses, which constitutes the "treasure." Those who suppose that the "treasure" is gold or silver or something else of value, refer to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>, and Herod., 3:103; Pers., 'Sat.,' 2:10. <span class="cmt_word">The excellency</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the excess</span> or <span class="accented">abundance</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of God, and not of us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of God, and not from us</span>.

It is not only "the sufferings," but even "the dying," of Christ of which his true followers partake (<a href="../../par/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>, "For thy sake are we killed all the day long"). St. Paul, who was "in deaths oft" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>), was thus being made conformable unto Christ's death (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this we groan.</span> Since we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, who assures us of that future building from God, we, in this earthly tent, "groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To be clothed upon;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to further clothe ourselves with</span>. Here the metaphors of a tent and a garment - the "wandering tent" and the "mortal vesture of decay" - are interfused in a manner on which only the greatest writers can venture The corruptible yearns to clothe itself with the incorruptible, the mortal with immortality (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>).

The word "naked" must then mean "bodiless," and the reference will be to those whom, at his coming, Christ shall find <span class="accented">clothed in these mortal bodies</span>, and not separated from them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quick and not dead (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). This seems to be the simplest and most natural of the multitude of strange interpretations with which the pages of commentators are filled. It is true that the aorist <span class="accented">endusamenoi</span>, means literally, "having clothed ourselves," and that, in taking this meaning, we should have expected the perfect participle <span class="accented">endedumenoi</span>, having been clothed. If this be thought an insuperable difficulty, we must suppose the verse to mean "If, that is, in reality we shall be found [at Christ's coming] after having put on some intermediate body, and therefore not as mere disembodied spirits." But there is no allusion in Scripture to any intermediate body, nor is any gleam of light shed on the mode of life among the dead between death and resurrection, though the Church rejects the dream of Psychopannychia, or an interval of unconscious sleep. The uncertainty of the meaning is increased by two various readings, <span class="accented">ei per</span> instead of <span class="accented">ei ge</span>, which latter expresses greater doubt about the matter; and <span class="accented">ekdusamenoi</span> (D, F, G), which would mean "if in reality, after <span class="accented">unclothing</span> ourselves [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after 'shuffling off this mortal coil'], we shall not be found naked." This seems to be the conjecture of some puzzled copyists, who did not see that a <span class="accented">contrast</span>, and not a coincidence, between the two expressions is intended. If this reading were correct, it would mean, as Chrysostom says, "Even if we would lay aside the body. we shall not there be presented <span class="accented">without a</span> body, but with the <span class="accented">same</span> body which has then become incorruptible." It is quite untenable to make "clothed" mean "clothed <span class="accented">with righteousness</span>," as Olshausen does. In the Talmud, 'Shabbath' (f. 152, 2), the righteous are compared to men who keep from stain the robes given them by a king (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their bodies), which robes the king deposits in his treasury and sends the wearers away (bodiless) in peace; but foolish servants stain these robes, and the king sends the robes to the wash, and the wearers in prison.

St. Paul here repudiates the Manichean notion that the body is a disgrace, or in itself the source of evil. He was not like Plotinus, who "blushed that he had a body;" or like St. Francis of Assist, who called his body "my brother the ass;" or like the Cure d'Ars, who (as we have said) spoke of his body as "ce cadavre." He does not, therefore, desire to get rid of his body, but to "clothe it over" with the garment of immortality. Incidentally this implies the wish that he may be <span class="accented">alive</span> and not <span class="accented">dead</span> when the Lord returns (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-54</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mortality</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the mortal</span>; <span class="accented">that which is mortal</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Might be swallowed up of life.</span> As in the case of Enoch (<a href="../../par/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Elijah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), who entered into life otherwise than through "the grave and gate of death." St. Paul wishes to enter the "building from God" without having been first buried in the collapse of the "soul's dark cottage battered and decayed." He desires to put on the robe of immortality without stripping off the rent garb of the body.

The Pelagians raised questions on this verse about the sinlessness of infants, etc., all of which  may be left on one side, as probably nothing was more absolutely distant from the thoughts of St. Paul. Observe that each is to receive the natural issues of what he has done. There is to be an analogy between the sin and the retribution. The latter is but the ripe fruit of the former. We shall be punished by the action of natural laws, not of arbitrary inflictions. We shall reap what we have sown, not harvests of other grain (<a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be good or bad.</span> St. Paul, who always confines himself to one topic at a time, does not here enter on the question of the cutting off of the entailed curse by repentance and forgiveness.

It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men," either "to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves," or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), "that our sole ambition is to please God." The rendering, "the terror of the Lord," for the every day expression, "the fear of the Lord," was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. <span class="accented">We persuade men</span>.

Yet for those who were sufficiently finely strung to understand it, there was an almost pathetic irony involved in it. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory in appearance, and not in heart;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in face</span>. The grounds of their boasting, whatever they were, were superficial and external (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-7.htm">2 Corinthians 10:7</a>), not deep and sincere. But those who would judge of Paul aright must look into his very heart, and not on his face. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">For whether we be beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> to God: or whether we be sober, <i>it is</i> for your cause.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whether we be beside ourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for whether we were mad</span>. Evidently some person or some faction had said of St. Paul, "He is beside himself," just as Festus said afterwards, "Paul, thou art mad," and as the Jews said of Paul's Lord and Master (<a href="../../par/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>). The fervour of the apostle, his absorption in his work, his visions and ecstasies, his "speaking with tongues more than they all," his indifference to externals, his bursts of emotion, might all have given colour to this charge, which he here ironically accepts. "Mad or self controlled -all was for your sakes." <span class="cmt_word">It is to God;</span> rather <span class="accented">for God</span>. My "enthusiasm," "exaltation," or, if you will, my "madness," was but a phase of my work for him. <span class="cmt_word">We be sober.</span> The word "sober" (<span class="accented">sophron</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from two words which mean" to <span class="accented">save the mind</span>."

It is the exact antithesis to madness (<a href="../../par/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>). What you call my "madness" belongs to the relation between my own soul and God; my practical sense and tact are for you. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for you</span>.

What compels Paul to sacrifice himself to the work of God for his converts is the conviction, which he formed once for all at his conversion, that One, even Christ, died on behalf of all men (<a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-19</a>) a redeeming death (ver. 21); and that, consequently, in that death, all <span class="accented">potentially</span> died with him - died to their life of sin, and rose to the life of righteousness. The best comments on this bold and concentrated phrase are - "I died to the Law that I might live to Christ;" "I have been <span class="accented">crucified with Christ"</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); and, "Ye died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>). When Christ died, all humanity, of which he was the federal Head, died potentially with him to sin and selfishness, as he further shows in the next verse.

The whole phrase, which has been interpreted in multitudes of different ways, and has led to many different hypotheses, must be understood in accordance with the context. St. Paul is saying that he has now renounced all mere earthly and human judgments; and he here implies that the day has been (whether - which is a very unlikely view - before his conversion, when he looked on Christ as a "deceiver," or just after his conversion, when possibly he may only have known him partially as the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> Messiah) when he knew Christ only in this fleshly way; but henceforth he will know him so no more. Probably this "knowing Christ after the flesh" is a rebuke to those members of the Christ party at Corinth who may have boasted that they were superior to all others because they had personally seen or known Christ - a spirit which Christ himself not only discouraged (<a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>) but even rebuked (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). To St. Paul Christ is now regarded as far above all local, national, personal, and Jewish limitations, and as the principle of spiritual life in the heart of every Christian. In the view which he took of his Lord St. Paul henceforth has banished all Jewish particularism for gospel catholicity. He regards Christ, not in the light of earthly relationships and conditions, but as the risen, glorified, eternal, universal Saviour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore if any man <i>be</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. If even a human, personal, external knowledge of Christ is henceforth of no significance, it follows that there must have been a total change in all relations towards him. The historic fact of such a changed relationship is indicated clearly in <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>. Mary Magdalene was there lovingly taught that a "recognition of Christ after the flesh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as merely a <span class="accented">human</span> friend, was to be a thing of the past. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Christian.

The phrase is borrowed from the rabbis who used it to express the condition of a proselyte.

The expression is closely analogous to that in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where it is said that Christ has been "made <span class="accented">a curse</span> for us." He was, as St. Augustine says, "delictorum susceptor, non commissor." He knew no sin; nay, he was the very righteousness, holiness itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), and yet, for our benefit, God made him to be "sin" for us, in that he "sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). Many have understood the word "sin" in the sense of sin offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-9.htm">Leviticus 5:9</a>, LXX.); but that is a precarious application of the word, which is not justified by any other passage in the New Testament. We cannot, as Dean Plumptre says, get beyond the simple statement, which St. Paul is content to leave in its unexplicable mystery, "Christ identified with man's sin; man identified with Christ's righteousness." And thus, in Christ, God becomes Jehovah-Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might be made the righteousness of God in him;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that we might become</span>.

The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word "Belial," and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8-10</a>.).

Similarly St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>), after speaking of God's fatherhood and the hopes which it inspires, adds, "And every man that hath this hope <span class="accented">in him purifieth himself</span> even as he is pure" (comp. <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From all filthiness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">from all defilement</span>. Sin leaves on the soul the moral stain of guilt, which was typified by the ceremonial defilements of the Levitical Law (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25, 26</a>). The word used for "filth" in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> is different. <span class="cmt_word">Of the flesh and spirit.</span> From everything which outwardly pollutes the body and inwardly the soul; the two being closely connected together, so that what defiles the flesh inevitably also defiles the soul, and what defiles the spirit degrades also the body.

Clearly he is again thinking of definite slanders against himself. His sternness to the offender may have been denounced as a wrong; his generous sanction of broad views about clean and unclean meats, idol-offerings, etc., may have been represented as corrupting others by false teaching (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>) or bad example (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>); his urgency about the collection for the saints (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>), or his assertion of legitimate authority, may have been specified as greed for power. The verb <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> is often used in connection with other verbs, implying sensuality. It is difficult for us even to imagine that St. Paul had ever been charged with gross immorality; but it may have been so, for in a corrupt atmosphere everything is corrupt. Men like Nero and Heliogabalus, being themselves the vilest of men, openly declared their belief that no man was pure, and many in the heathen world may have been inclined to similar suspicions. Of Whitefield, the poet says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His sins were such as Sodom never knew,<br />And calumny stood up to swear all true."</span> We know too that the Christians were universally charged with Thyestean banquets and promiscuous licentiousness. It is, however, more natural to take <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> in its <span class="accented">general</span> sense, in which it means "to overreach," "to claim or seize more than one's just rights" (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</a> he is defending himself against similar charges, as also in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 5:12; 6:3; 10:7-11; 11; 12.<span class="accented">, passim</span>). For similar strains of defence, see those of Moses and of Samuel.

This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words "life" and "death" on the lips of a Christian (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>).

The word "affliction" reminds St. Paul to resume the thread of the narrative which makes this letter almost <span class="accented">like an itinerary</span>. He has spoken of his trials in Ephesus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>) and in the Troad (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12, 13</a>), and now he tells them that <span class="accented">even</span> in Macedonia he was no less troubled and agitated. <span class="cmt_word">Our flesh had no rest.</span> <span class="accented">External</span> troubles assailed him as well as inward anxiety.

The style, in its picturesque irregularity, almost seems as though it were broken by sobs. <span class="cmt_word">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span> "From without battles, from within fears." No light is thrown on these "battles." The Acts of the Apostles has no details to give us of this brief stay  in Macedonia. The "fears" were doubtless still connected with anxiety as to the reception of Titus, and of his First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-20.htm">1 Corinthians 12:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who comforteth those that are cast down.</span> "The Comforter of the humble comforted us, even God." The word "humble" has in classical Greek the sense of "mean," "abject." Pride, not humility, was the virtue even of Stoic morality. Christ was the first to reveal the beatitude of lowliness (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). Doubtless the word still retained some of its old associations, and had been used of St. Paul in a disparaging sense (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). But he whom his opponents accused of so much egotism, ambition, and arrogance, meekly accepts the term and applies it to himself. God (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>).

The absence of Titus from the Acts is another proof of the fragmentariness of that book. It is evident that he was an ardent, able, active fellow worker, and most beloved friend of the apostle (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>).

St. Paul, partly because of his infirmities, was peculiarly dependent on the support of human sympathy (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>). It was not, however, the mere arrival of Titus which cheered him, but still more the good news which he brought, and which partially lightened his anxieties. In all probability this letter was written almost immediately after the arrival of Titus, and while the joy caused by his presence was still glowing in the apostle's heart. It is characteristic of the seclusion of an austere life that St. Jerome supposes the cause of the apostle's distress to have been that Titus was his interpreter, and that in his absence he could not preach! <span class="cmt_word">Your earnest desire.</span> Your yearning to see me once more.

Every one has experienced the anxiety which has followed the despatch of some painful letter. If it does good, well; but perhaps it <span class="accented">may</span> do harm. The severity was called for; it seemed a duty to write severely. But how will the rebuke be received? Might we not have done better if we had used language less uncompromisingly stern? As St. Paul thought with intense anxiety that perhaps in his zeal for truth he may have irrevocably alienated the feelings of the Corinthians, whom, with all their grave faults, he loved, a moment came when he actually regretted what he had written. He himself assures us that he had this feeling. Those who try all kinds of fantastic hypotheses and tortuous exegesis to explain away this phrase as though it were inconsistent with St. Paul's inspiration, go to Scripture to find there their own <span class="accented">a priori</span> dogmas, not to seek what Scripture really says. The doctrine of inspiration is not the fetish into which it has been degraded by formal systems of scholastic theology. Inspiration was not a mechanical dictation of words, but the influence of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men who retained all their own natural emotions. <span class="cmt_word">For I perceive,</span> etc. There are various ways of taking this clause. Nothing, however, is simpler than to regard it as a parenthetic remark (for I see that that Epistle, though it were but for a time, saddened you). <span class="cmt_word">Though it were but for a season.</span> (For the phrase, see <a href="../../par/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>.) He means to say that their grief will at any rate cease when they receive this letter, and he can bear the thought of having pained them when he remembers the brevity of their grief and the good effects which resulted from it.

Some take "not to be regretted" with "salvation," but it is a very unsuitable adjective to that substantive. <span class="cmt_word">The sorrow of the world.</span> Here sorrow for the loss, or disappointment, or shame, or ruin, or sickness caused by sin; such as the false repentance of Cain, Saul, Ahithophel, Judas, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Death</span>.

The Sinaitic manuscript has "your care for yourselves." The variations have partly risen from the apparent strangeness of the remark that his letter had been written in order that their care for him might be manifested <span class="accented">to themselves</span>; in other words, that  they might learn from their own conduct the reality of their earnest feelings for him. He has already spoken of this "earnest care" of theirs (ver. 11), but not in quite the same sense. Certainly, however, the reading followed by our Authorized Version, even if it be a correction, furnishes a more natural meaning (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>), and the other may have arisen from a clerical error.

"Because if I have boasted anything to him on your behalf, I was not put to the blush;" in other words, "One reason of my exceeding gladness was that you fully justified that very favorable picture of you which I had drawn for Titus when I was urging him to be the bearer of my letter." <span class="cmt_word">Is found a truth;</span> literally, <span class="accented">proved itself to be a truth</span>. Here again there is a most delicate reference to the charge of levity and unveracity which had been brought against him (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). I always spoke the truth <span class="accented">to you</span>; but I might well have feared that, in speaking <span class="accented">of you</span> to Titus, my affection for you had led me to overstep the limits of perfect accuracy. But you yourselves, by proving yourselves worthy of all I said of you, have established my perfect truthfulness, even in the only point where I might have thought it doubtful.

The phrase is like the modern "I wish to inform you." In this and the next chapter St. Paul, having fully spoken of the joy which had been caused to him by their reception of his first letter, and having said as much as he then intended to say in answer to the charges insinuated against him, proceeds to give directions about the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem. He had already spoken of it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>), but feared that they were behindhand, and now sends Titus to stimulate their zeal. The style throughout is brief and allusive, because he had already, in various ways, brought this matter fully before them. Throughout this section he shows in a remarkable degree the tact, courtesy, high sense of honour, and practical wisdom which were among his many gifts. The "but" with which the chapter begins in the original is St. Paul's ordinary formula of transition, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, etc. (For the phrase, "we inform you," see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>.) It is one of numberless incidental proofs of the genuineness of this group of Epistles - the Epistles of the second great missionary journey - that the same words, phrases, and thoughts constantly recur in them. <span class="cmt_word">The grace of God</span> (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">Bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which is being bestowed in the Churches</span>. St. Paul wants to tell the Corinthians how extremely liberal the Macedonians have been, since it was his custom to stir up one Church by the example of another (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>); but he begins by speaking of their generosity as a proof of the grace which they are receiving from the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">The Churches of Macedonia</span>. The only Macedonian Churches of which we have any details in the New Testament are those of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. They seem to have been peculiarly dear to St. Paul, who was attracted by their cheerfulness in affliction and their generosity in the midst of want. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a great trial of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in much testing of affliction</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in an affliction which put to the proof their Christian character. "They were not simply afflicted," says St. Chrysostom, "but in such a way as also to become approved by their endurance." (For the word rendered "trial," see <a href="../../par/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>, and in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>.) "Affliction" seems to have befallen the Churches of Macedonia  very heavily (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>), chiefly through the jealousy of the Jews, who excited the hatred of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The abundance of their joy.</span> Another reference to joy in sadness (see on 2 Corinthians 7:4). There is not the least necessity to understand the verb "is" or "was" after this clause. "The abundance...  abounded" is indeed a pleonasm, but is not at all unlike the style of St. Paul. He means to say that their joy overflowed their affliction, and their liberality overflowed their poverty (<a href="../../par/mark/12-44.htm">Mark 12:44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their deep poverty;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their pauperism to the depth</span>; their abysmal penury.

Stanley refers to Arnold's 'Roman Commonwealth,' where he mentions that the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia, which had suffered greatly in the three civil wars, appealed successfully to Tiberius for a diminution of their burdens. The gift of the Macedonians was like the widow's mite (<a href="../../par/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3, 4</a>, where similar words occur <span class="accented">- perisseuo, husterema</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of their liberality;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of their singleness of purpose</span> or <span class="accented">simplicity</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). The "grace" and single-heartedness to which he alludes <span class="accented">showed</span> themselves in liberality.

St. Paul does not mean that the notion of making the collection <span class="accented">originated</span> with them (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>), but only that they displayed a voluntary energy in carrying it out.

The translation then is, "begging us for the grace of participation in this ministration to the saints." They were so willing in the matter that they entreated me, as a favour (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), to allow them to have a share in this contribution, because it was to be given to the saints, that is, the suffering peer in the Church of Jerusalem. This Church suffered from chronic poverty. Even the Jewish population were liable to famines, in one of which they had only been kept alive by the royal munificence of a proselyte, Queen Helena,of Adiabene. The Christians would, of course, suffer even more deeply, because they were drawn from the humblest classes and had fewer friends. This was one of the reasons why, as an act of common humanity, it was incumbent on the Gentile Christians to help them (<a href="../../par/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25, 26</a>).

They were so poor that it was impossible to expect much from them, but they surpassed my expectations in every way. The Church of Philippi, perhaps under the influence of Lydia, was remarkable for generosity, and was the only Church from which St. Paul would accept any personal help (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">First</span>.

(For a similar use of "and" to imply a matter of less importance, see <a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>.) The phrase, "by the will of God," implies thanksgiving to God for the grace which enabled them to give themselves to him, and their goods to his saints.

The remarks that follow are full of delicate reserve, but under their exquisite tact and urbanity we can perceive that the Corinthians had <span class="accented">talked</span> very loudly about their contributions, and had promised with great zeal, but had shown themselves somewhat slack in redeeming their promises. <span class="cmt_word">We exhorted Titus.</span> It is curious that this word is constantly used of the missions of Titus (ver. 17; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As he had began.</span> "That as no inaugurated (this collection), so he would also complete towards you this gracious work also."

In the following verses to ver. 15 he tells them his wishes about this collection. He desires them to show generosity among their other graces (ver. 7), not by way of command, but that they may emulate others and show their love (ver. 8) by following the example of Christ (ver. 9). And by acting thus they would prove the sincerity of their former promises (vers. 10, 11), especially as he did not wish them to give more than they could justly spare by way of reciprocity (vers. 12-15). <span class="cmt_word">As ye abound in every thing, in faith,</span> etc. Perhaps "by faith," etc., "St. Paul," says Grotius, "knew the art of the orators to move by praising." This method of conciliating attention is technically called <span class="accented">proparaitesis</span>.

The word for "poverty" would, in classical Greek, mean "pauperism" or "mendicancy." Dean Stanley (referring to Milman's 'Latin Christianity,' 5. bk. 12. c. 6) points out how large a place this verse occupied in the mediaeval controversies between the moderate and the extreme members of the mendicant orders. William of Ockham and others, taking the word "poverty" in its extremest sense, maintained that the Franciscans ought to possess <span class="accented">nothing</span>; but Pope John XXII., with the Dominicans, took a more rational view of the sense and of the historic facts.

The verb is the same as in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Not only to do, but also to be forward;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not only to do, but also to be willing</span>. The "to do" is in the aorist, the "to be willing" in the present. We should naturally have expected a reversed order, "not only to be willing, but also to put in action." There must be a strong touch of irony in the words, unless we interpret it to mean "not only to make the collection, but to be willing to add yet more to it." Perhaps in the "to be willing" lies the notion of "the cheerful giver," "the willing mind "(ch. 9:7; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A year ago;</span> rather, <span class="accented">since the previous year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> last year (ch. 9:2).

But there is no hint of this anywhere.

St. Paul may possibly be thinking of the reciprocity of spiritual and temporal benefits, as in <a href="../../par/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>; but if so he leaves the thought unexpressed. The application of the text to "works of supererogation" (Art. XIV.), as forming a fund at the disposal of the hierarchy in the way of indulgences, pardons, etc., is a singular perversion.

There can be no reference to any of the four written Gospels, for they were not in the hands of Christians till a later date; nor did the word "gospel" acquire this significance till afterwards. From <a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5</a>, it is somewhat precariously inferred that  St. Luke is meant. Others have conjectured Barnabas, Silas (who are out of the question), Erastus, Mark, a brother of Titus, etc. St. Luke is not unlikely to have been selected as a delegate by the Church of Philippi; but further than this we can say nothing. St. Luke was not a Macedonian by birth, and any Macedonian (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Aristarchus, Sopater, Secundus, Epaphroditus) seems to be excluded by <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>.

The word "avoiding" (<span class="accented">stellomenoi</span>) literally means "furling sail," and then "taking precautions." It may, however, mean "making this arrangement" (see <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>). Too much stress has been laid on St. Paul's "use of nautical terms" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, etc.).

St. Paul here sets a valuable and necessary example to all Christians who are entrusted with the management of charitable funds. It is their duty to take every step which may place them above the possibility of of suspicion. Their management of the sums entrusted to them should be obviously and transparently business-like and honourable. St. Paul taught this behaviour both by example and by precept (<a href="../../par/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>). There is such a thing as a foolish and reprehensible indifference to public opinion (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). Yet with all his noble carefulness, St. Paul did not escape this very slander (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this abundance.</span> The word, which occurs here only, means literally "succulence," but in the LXX. the adjective means "rich" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>).

"Zeal <span class="accented">from</span> you" means zeal which emanated from the Corinthians and aroused emulation in others.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Macedonians</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any friends from Macedonia (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>).

St. Paul asks them to be ready with their contributions for <span class="accented">his</span> sake, not for their own; that <span class="accented">he</span> may not have to blush for his generous words respecting them, whereas really the discredit would be simply theirs. <span class="cmt_word">Confident boasting;</span> rather, <span class="accented">confidence</span>. The reading "of boasting" is not genuine here. For the word <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> in the sense of "confidence," see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a>. The use of the word to represent the "Persons" of the Blessed Trinity is later. The other sense of the word, "substance" (or underlying base of attributes), is found in <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-5.htm">2 Corinthians 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as <i>a matter of</i> bounty, and not as <i>of</i> covetousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they would go before unto you.</span> The triple repetition of the word "before" shows how earnest St. Paul is in the matter. The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. <span class="cmt_word">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before;</span> <span class="accented">your previously promised blessing, bounty</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessing</span>. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in <a href="../../par/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, etc. (LXX.); <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.

It is less likely that the word <span class="accented">pleonexia</span> refers to the "parsimony" of the Corinthians, as though the <span class="accented">smallness</span> of their gift would show their greed for large gains. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">But this <i>I say</i>, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this I say.</span> The Greek only has "But this." The ellipse can hardly be "I say." It is an accusative used absolutely  - "as to their." Compare "But one thing" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall reap also sparingly.</span> In the Greek the more emphatic order is "sparingly also shall reap." The metaphor of the harvest implies that the more generous the gift the richer will be the return; and that "withholding more than is meet" will only tend to poverty (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>).

Compare "He that showeth mercy, with <span class="accented">cheerfulness"</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>). The rabbis said that cheerful kindness, even if nothing was given, was better than a morose gift.

The word <span class="accented">autarkeia</span> (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>) in the Stoic philosophy was used for the perfect independence which enabled a man to stand alone. The term is here softened and Christianized to express the contentment which arises from the full supply of all our needs by God. The affirmations of the original are as emphatic as language can make them. They express that the man who places all his trust upon God will be "perfect and entire, lacking nothing" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11, 19</a>).
