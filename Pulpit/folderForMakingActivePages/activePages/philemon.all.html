The name Appia, or Apphia, is either the Roman Appia Hellenized, which was the conjecture of Grotins (see Introduction), or more probably a native Phrygian name, from <span class="accented">Appa</span> or <span class="accented">Appha</span>, <span class="accented">a term of endearment</span>. The name does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;</span> is not unlikely to have been added by way of explanation. St. Paul has used it in five other places, and always in the same sense, viz. <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a>. Most commentators, and particularly Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Theophylact, among the ancients, infer that Apphia was the wife of Philemon. Otherwise, why mention her name here? <span class="cmt_word">Archippus</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>, where he is said to have received a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. a</span> ministry or service, in the Church. This word, when used without a determining genitive, denotes <span class="accented">service to</span> others in a general and undefined sense. But more commonly with some limiting word; as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, office of teaching (<a href="../../par/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, office or function of death (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>). The general view is that Archippus was the presbyter who ministered to that congregation which assembled at the house of Philemon, though Ambrose and Jerome, with other commentators ancient and modern, think that he was the bishop. Grotius, however, takes him to have been a deacon. (It is a very precarious inference that he was <span class="accented">a son</span> of Philemon and Appia.) Probably he was fulfilling a temporary mission only in Colossae, and that would be the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the passage cited. Epaphras, a resident in Colossae (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>), is spoken of as having been the founder of the Church there (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7, 8</a>), and as still being responsible for it (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Primasius calls Epaphras bishop and Archippus deacon; and so Grotius. It may be that these theories err in ascribing too rigid and technical a meaning to the terms of ecclesiastical service at this early stage of their employment. Epaphras was, however, at this time in Rome with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>), and it is possible that Archippus was filling his place temporarily. It will be safer to call him (with Bishop Wordsworth) a presbyter. It is, as we have said, an unsupported idea of some writers ancient and modern (Theod. Mopsuest., Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Olshausen, Lightfoot) that he was the <span class="accented">son</span> of Philemon (but see below). <span class="cmt_word">Our fellow-soldier</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of himself and St. Timothy, as engaged in the same warfare for Christ (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>). The same term is applied in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a> to Epaphroditus, and also the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of Ver. 1. And to the <span class="cmt_word">Church in thy house.</span> Mede (so Chrysostom and Theodoret also) understands this as meaning "and to the whole of thy family" (which is a Christian one) - a suggestion quite worth considering. For a separate letter "to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colossae" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>) was brought by the same messengers, and it would seem natural that, in a matter so personal to Philemon, salutations should be confined to his own family. The phrase is used more than once (see <a href="../../par/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>, which seems rather to point the other way; but especially <a href="../../par/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a>, "Nymphas and the Church which is in his house," which, since it was in Colossae itself, seems almost conclusive for that meaning). The <span class="accented">Ecclesia domestica</span> was very familiar in the apostolic times. Theodoret states that the house of Philemon was still pointed out as late as the fifth century. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-3.htm">Philemon 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you, and peace.</span> The secular formula of salutation was <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26</a>); in Latin, <span class="accented">multam</span> or <span class="accented">plurimare salutem ant plenissimam</span>. St. Paul's formula was almost invariably as above, "Grace to you, and peace" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-3.htm">Galatians 1:3</a>; and others). To Timothy (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>) and <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, "Grace, mercy, and peace."

This is an habitual phrase of St. Paul (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>). "It is to be noted that for the thing on account of which he gives thanks, he at the same time prays" (Calvin). For no good work is ever so complete in us that it does not need to be "continued and ended" in us by God. <span class="cmt_word">Making mention of thee in my prayers.</span> The foregoing remark attain applies. Grotius observes that "we learn from this that all addresses to God may be <span class="accented">called prayers</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, even those in which nothing is asked but thanks are given." But this is apparently not such a case; the petition which St. Paul offered for Philemon being stated in Ver. 6. And thus Chrysostom explains the passage. "Always" may be connected with "I thank," or with "making mention," preferably the former (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Calvin, Lightfoot).

Refer "faith" to "the Lord Jesus" and "love" to "all the saints" (a <span class="accented">chiasmus</span>, or cross-reference). Note that the phrase is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. erga</span>, towards) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; perhaps because Christ cannot now be <span class="accented">reached</span> by bodily efforts, but only <span class="accented">aspired towards</span> by the soul; while the poor can actually be reached and ministered unto. "Ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>). All Christians are called "saints" in the Scriptures, as <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>, and invariably. What a reminder to them of their "<span class="accented">holy calling"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>)! Meyer notes, however, that it is not uncommon with St. Paul to vary the preposition (<a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).

"<span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">refresh the bowels</span> is (in Paul) to be taken as meaning a lightening of troubles, so that they may rest with minds free from all sorrow and annoyance" (Calvin). <span class="cmt_word">Brother</span>. How persuasively the sentence is turned! An old commentator remarks, "Paul does not yet come to his request, but prepares and softens beforehand the mind of Philemon" (Scipio Gentilis). This course of proceeding is exactly what Quintilian prescribes to an advocate, "His velut fomentis, si quid erit asperum, praemolliemus, quo facilius aures judicum admittant" ('De Institut. Orat.,' 4:3).

Secular warrant for doing so he had none. Such authority and license, however, he  would not use on this occasion. He prefers to rely wholly on the respect and personal attachment felt towards him by Philemon, for the granting of his request, which he now proceeds to state. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech <i>thee</i>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being such a one as Paul the aged</span>; <span class="accented">a veteran</span>. Theodoret comments thus: "<span class="accented">For</span> he who hears Paul, hears the preacher of the whole world, the traverser of land and sea, the chosen vessel, and other things besides he is.... He adds also 'the aged,' showing the gray hairs which have grown during his labors." "<span class="accented">Non aetatem</span>, sed offieium" (Calvin). P<span class="accented">resbutes</span> may mean "an ambassador" - "the ambassador of Christ Jesus, and now also his prisoner," as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a> (and see Ephesians 3:1 and Ephesians 4:1 of the same Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">A prisoner of Jesus Christ</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for his cause. The apostle was in custody at Rome, owing to a long suspension of his trial, for causes not known to us. "Have regard for Paul; have regard for my bonds, which I wear as a preacher of the truth" (Theodoret). "Great reverence is due to these who endure sufferings for the most honorable causes" (Grotius).

Onesimus</span>; <span class="accented">my child</span> (Revised Version). The name of Onesimus could not have been a pleasing one in the ears of Philemon. Note with what caution and almost timidity it is at length introduced. He does not interpose for the ingrate with apostolic dignity, but pleads for him with fatherly love. He puts himself side by side with him, and calls him <span class="accented">his son</span>. Some of the old commentators conclude, from <a href="../../par/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9</a>, that Onesimus was a native of Colossae, and thence discuss whether he could have been a slave born in Philemon's house of a slave-mother, or whether he was sold in his youth by his father - a custom so common to the Phrygians (as to the Circassians in later times) as to have been noticed by Cicero. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who was aforetime unprofitable ... to me.</span> The play upon words seems unmistakable, and is peculiarly Pauline. Onesimus means "useful," or "profitable;" <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "unprofitable," and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is emphatic, "very profitable." "Useful he is named, but in time past he was (I confess it) not useful, but useless; in future, however, he will be of great use to us both." Compare with this the corresponding passage of Pliny's 'Letter to Sabinianus,' given in the Introduction. "Unprofitable" is a figure of speech, a <span class="accented">euphemism</span>, for "useless and even injurious." St. Paul makes the best of Onesimus's fault that it will in justice allow. But an old commentator says bluntly that Onesimus was "damnosus fuga et furto." How could he have been, in his unconverted state, otherwise than "unprofitable" to his master? "Olim paganus," says a Lapide, "jam Christianus; olim fur, jam fidelis servus; olim profugus, jam redux."

It had not been altogether easy for the apostle to part with the youth, whom he might not see again. The whole Epistle is full of this strong and yearning affection. Thou therefore receive him. Do thou also act as becomes a Christian; receive him as my son. "Wonderfully efficacious this method for appeasing the anger of Philemon! For he was not able to rage or to do anything harshly against one whom Paul had called his own bowels" (Estius). A, F, G, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> omit "receive," as also Tischendorf.

The story tells itself if we read between the lines. What steadfast adherence to principle on the part of the apostle, when the help of Onesimus would have been so welcome to him in his weak health, and his position as a prisoner!

His consent might then fairly have been said to be <span class="accented">extorted</span>, not freely given.  This latter word is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (unique phrase) so far as the New Testament is concerned, though it is found in <a href="../../par/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a> of the LXX., as in Xenophon and other classical writers.

The relation of master and slave would have been in any case, and would still be, terminated by death. But it was now replaced by a new relation of Christian brotherhood, which would be permanent - a great advantage. So Calvin, Grotius, and many others. Meyer's objection does not seem of much weight (compare the <span class="accented">Perpetua mancipia</span> of <a href="../../par/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>). Baur thinks that in this verse he has reached the core of the Epistle - the ethical truth which it seeks to embody (but see Introduction: "Authenticity and Characteristics").

But here the sense is apparently as above; literally, a <span class="accented">partner</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-18.htm">Philemon 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <i>thee</i> ought, put that on mine account;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - [But] <span class="cmt_word">if he hath wronged thee</span> [at all]. It would have been needlessly irritating to Philemon to go into the details of Onesimus's offences. No doubt St. Paul had had an account of them from the repentant youth, but he had far too much tact to occupy himself and Philemon in the discussion of details. The hypothetic form avoids the whole of these. It suffices that he assumes the responsibility of repayment. <span class="cmt_word">Owes thee anything.</span> As a matter of moral right at the bar of conscience. For in a secular court the slave could be neither debtor nor creditor, properly speaking, as against his master. This offence was probably embezzlement or purloining while in service. A, C, D*, F, G, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> read (<span class="accented">elloga</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>reckon it to me.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">I Paul have written <i>it</i> with mine own hand, I will repay <i>it</i>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I Paul have written</span> <span class="accented">- write it</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">with my own hand, I will repay it.</span> Thus St. Paul took upon himself legally the repayment of the debt. "Prioribus verbis proprie cautio [a bail or security] continetur: his autem constituti obligatio. Hoc Latine dicitur pecuniam constituere: de quo titulus est in Digestis <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> dicunt Graeci" (Scipio Gentilis). <span class="cmt_word">Albeit I do not say to thee,</span> etc.; "though I do not remind thee [while so saying] that thou owest even thyself to me!" Philemon owed to the apostle that debt of which the obligation outweighed every other - the help by which he had been led out of spiritual darkness and brought to the knowledge of the truth. St. Paul was (as we must conclude from this allusion) the "spiritual father" of Philemon - a phrase he himself uses in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-20.htm">Philemon 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, indeed, brother, let me have joy of thee.</span> This word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> is from the same root as the word "Onesimus," and the apostle, <span class="accented">more suo</span>, relaxing into his friendly familiar manner after the grave and touching language of the last few verses, plays upon the word. Let me <span class="accented">have profit</span> of thee - let me have Onesimus of thee. In the Lord (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The phrase is twice repeated in this verse, and is very characteristic of St. Paul. But A, C, D*, F, G, I, read en <span class="accented">Christo</span> in the second clause. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> has been altered, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">second</span>.; "refresh my heart in Christ" (Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-21.htm">Philemon 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I wrote unto thee</span>; <span class="accented">write</span> (Revised Version; see Ver. 19), or perhaps referring back, as in Ver. 19, to the request in Ver. 17. The strong, fervid, and repeated appeals of the apostle had not been caused by distrust of Philemon, nor of their own efficacy, but were the natural outcome of the strong interest he felt in the case of Onesimus, and the desire he felt to replace him in the favor of his master; partly also, perhaps, to the warmth and fervor of his natural character, which uttered itself involuntarily in forcible expressions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a></div><div class="verse">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lodging</span>. There was this one additional inducement that could be brought to bear upon the mind of Philemon, viz. the expectation of speedily seeing him in person, and this, in conclusion, he uses. "I do not think that the apostle was so rich or encumbered with such great packages that he needed a lodging prepared beforehand, and was not content with a narrow dwelling-place, but thought the most spacious houses scanty for the accommodation of his small body; but that, while Philemon was expecting [the apostle] to come to him, he would the more do what he had requested" (Jerome). Meyer makes much of the improbability that St. Paul, starting from Rome, should bespeak a lodging in Colossae. Yet he suggests that it was  perfectly natural that, starting from <span class="accented">Caesarea</span>, the apostle should take <span class="accented">Colossae</span> on the road to Rome. But the one seems almost as probable as the other. The apostle, on his release, had, so far as we know, no definite plans; the cities of Asia Minor were familiar to him, and he would naturally prepare to go wherever the first pressing occasion, that of Onesimus, called him. N reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "salutes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philemon/1-23.htm">Philemon 1:23</a></div><div class="verse">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salute</span>. The salutations correspond generally to those with which the Epistle to the Colossians closes, but they are fuller, as is natural, in the longer Epistle. The order is in - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word">Colossians</span>:</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tychicus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Onesimus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aristarchus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Marcus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jesus Justus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Epaphras <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lucas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Demas <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word">Philemon</span>:</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Epaphras <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Marcus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aristarchus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Demas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lucas <span class="cmt_word">My fellow-prisoner.</span> The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>, besides the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>. As to <span class="cmt_word">Epaphras</span>, see above. <span class="cmt_word">Marcus</span>, having once forsaken the apostle (<a href="../../par/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>), had now returned, and was with him in Rome. <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus</span> was "a Macedonian of Thessalonica," and had accompanied St. Paul in his memorable voyage to Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Demas</span> was now the "co-worker" of the apostle at Rome, but at a later period he had departed unto Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), and we know nothing of his subsequent history. Tradition (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 41:6) relates that he also apostatized from Christianity; but the apostle's phrase, though a strong one, does not necessarily mean this. <span class="cmt_word">Lucas</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>).
