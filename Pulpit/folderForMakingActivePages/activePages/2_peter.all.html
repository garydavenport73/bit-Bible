The same form of the name is found in <a href="../../par/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; it also occurs in <a href="../../par/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, where St. James refers to St. Peter's speech on the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians. It is the form always used in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament. The old man's thoughts go back to his early years; he describes himself by the familiar name of his youth; he uses that Greek form of it which was most distinctively Jewish. But he joins with the old name, which spoke of Judaism, the new name which the Lord Jesus had given him  - the name which describes him as a stone or rock, which indicates also his close connection with that Rock on which the Church is built, which is Christ. His names combine Hebrew and Greek, Jewish and Christian, associations. He is writing probably, as in his First Epistle, to Churches of mingled Jewish and Gentile elements. The first word of the Epistle supplies an argument for the genuineness of the Epistle. It is scarcely possible that an imitator, who was acquainted with the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>), and shows, as some say, so much anxiety to identify himself with the apostle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12-18</a>), would have announced himself by a name different from that used in the First Epistle, and would have adopted a form of the Hebrew name varying from that which occurs so frequently in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter, like St. Paul, describes himself as a servant, literally, "a slave," a bondman of Jesus Christ. We are not our own; we are bought with a price; we have work to do for our Master. St. Peter's work was that of a missionary, an apostle sent into the world to win souls for Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.</span> The word rendered "obtained" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means properly "to obtain by lot," as in <a href="../../par/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>. It is noticeable that one of the few places in which it occurs in the New Testament is in a speech of St. Peter's (<a href="../../par/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>); its use here implies that faith is a gift of God. The word for "like precious" equally precious) is found only here in the New Testament; it calls to our memory the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, and indicates a correspondence with the First Epistle. St. Peter addresses this Epistle simply to those who have obtained an equally precious faith "with us." By the last words he may mean himself only, or the apostles generally, or, possibly, all Jewish Christians. He is writing apparently to the same Churches to which his First Epistle was addressed (verse 16 and chapter 1 Peter 3:1); he says that their faith is equally precious with that of the apostles, or perhaps that the Gentiles have received the like precious gift with the chosen people. By "faith" he may mean the truths believed, as <a href="../../par/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>; or, more probably, faith in the subjective sense, the grace of faith, which receives those truths as a message from God (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> Some commentators, as Luther, Estius, etc., understand by "righteousness" in this place, the righteousness which God gives, as in <a href="../../par/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>, etc. But this seems unsuitable here; for faith is not given in righteousness, but rather righteousness in faith. Others take righteousness as the object of the faith - "to them that have Obtained faith in the righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are  enabled to believe in God's righteousness and to trust in it. This seems a forced interpretation. It is better to take the preposition as meaning "in the working of God's righteousness," in the sphere of its operation, and to understand "righteousness" as the attribute of God, his just and holy dealing with men. There is no respect of persons with God; in his righteousness he bestows the like precious faith on all who come to him, without distinction of race or country. According to the strict grammatical construction of the passage, "God" and "Saviour" are both predicates of "Jesus Christ," as in <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. The First and Second Persons of the blessed Trinity are distinguished in the following verse, and this has led several commentators to think that the same distinction should be made here. It is true that the absence of a second article does not make it absolutely certain that the two words "God" and "Saviour" must be taken as united under the one common article, and so regarded as two predicates of "Jesus Christ;" but it furnishes at least a very strong presumption in favour of this view, especially as there is not here, as there is in <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, any word like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to give definiteness to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Ellicott's note on Titus 2:13, and, on the other side, Alford's notes on both passages). The Lord Jesus is called "our Saviour" five times in this Epistle. The word does not occur in the First Epistle; but in St. Peter's speech (<a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>) the apostle declared to the Sanhedrin that God had exalted Jesus "to be a Prince and a Saviour." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-2.htm">2 Peter 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.</span> The order of the words in the Greek is the same as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>. The exact correspondence should be noticed. The writer of the Second Epistle, if not St. Peter himself, must have been attempting to imitate of set purpose the opening salutation of the First Epistle. Through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; rather, <span class="accented">in the knowledge.</span> The knowledge of God is the sphere in which grace and peace are communicated to the soul; they cannot be found outside that sphere. "Full knowledge" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may be regarded as the key-note of this Epistle, as "hope" is of the first. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; it means "knowledge" directed towards an object, gradually approaching nearer and nearer to it, concentrated upon it, fixed closely upon it. So it comes to mean the knowledge, not merely of intellectual apprehension, but rather of deep contemplation; the knowledge which implies love - for only love can concentrate continually the powers of the soul in close meditation upon its object. Comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, where, after saying in verse 8 that "knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) shall be done away," St. Paul continues, in verse 12, "Now I know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>) in part, but then I shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) even as also I am known (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)." He contrasts our present imperfect knowledge with the full knowledge which the blessed will have in heaven, and which God now has of us, using the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> of that fuller knowledge, as he had used <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the imperfect knowledge. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs several times in the Gospels, and is common in St. Paul's Epistles; it seems to imply a sort of protest against the knowledge that "puffeth up" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>), and especially against the knowledge "falsely so called" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>), which was claimed by the false teachers, who were the precursors of the coming Gnosticism (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). St. Peter had learned mere of the doings of these false teachers since he wrote the First Epistle, and this may perhaps be a reason for his frequent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the second. "Jesus our Lord" is a variation of the more common form, such as "the Lord Jesus;" it occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According as his Divine power;</span> better, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>, as in the Revised Version. The construction is the genitive absolute with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>. The words are to be closely connected with verse 2: "We need not fear, for God has given us all things that are necessary for our salvation; grace and peace will be multiplied unto us, if only we seek the knowledge of God." This is better than, with Huther and others, to make a full stop after verse 2, and to connect verses 3 and 4 closely with verse 5. The word for "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is unusual in the Greek Testament; it occurs only in two other places - verse 4 and <a href="../../par/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>. Hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hath granted.</span> St. Peter does not here use the ordinary verb for "to give," but one (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) which in the New Testament occurs only in this Epistle and in <a href="../../par/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>. "God hath given us all things for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) life," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all things necessary for life. By "life" St. Peter means the spiritual life of the soul; that life which consists in union with Christ, which is the life of Christ living in us. "Godliness" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is a word of the later apostolic age; besides this Epistle (in which it occurs four times) and a speech of St. Peter's in <a href="../../par/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, it is found only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles; it means reverence, true piety towards God. Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; literally,  <span class="accented">through the full knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of him that called us</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God. and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"). The best-supported reading seems to be that followed by the Revised Version, "By his own glory and virtue (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>)<span class="accented">."</span> Bengel says, "Ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quae dicuntur moralia; intime unum sunt utraque." All his glorious attributes make up his glory; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, virtue, is the energy, the activity of those attributes. The other reading, also well supported (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "through glory and virtue"), would mean nearly the same (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). God calls us through his attributes; his glorious perfections invite us, the revelation of those perfections calls us to his service. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, with one exception (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>), occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter's Epistles (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a> and 5). This <span class="accented">is</span>, so far, an argument in favour of identity of authorship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whereby he hath granted unto us h is precious and exceeding great promises.</span> Does the word "whereby" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things") refer to the immediately preceding words, "glory and virtue"? or is its antecedent to be found in the more distant "all things which pertain unto life and godliness"? Both views are possible. God first granted unto us all things necessary for life and godliness; through those first gifts, duly used, he has granted unto us others more precious still. But it <span class="accented">seems</span> better to connect the relative with the nearer antecedent. It is through God's glory and virtue, through his glorious attributes and the energetic working of those attributes, that he has granted the promises. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) should be translated "hath granted," as in the preceding verse. The word for "promise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs <span class="accented">elsewhere</span> only in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; it means the thing promised, not the act of promising. The order of the words, "exceeding great and precious," is differently given in the manuscripts; on the whole, that adopted by the Revised Version seems the best supported. The article with the first word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) has a possessive force, and is well rendered, "his precious promises." They are precious, because they will be certainly fulfilled in all their depth of blessed meaning, and because they are in part fulfilled at once (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>, "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance"). The word "precious" reminds us of <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 19</a>; the resemblance with <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> is apparent only, in the Authorized Version, not in the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">That by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that through these</span> (promises, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, through their fulfillment) <span class="accented">ye may beeome partakers.</span> It is true that the verb is aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), but it does not follow that, might be" is the right translation, or that the writer regarded the participation as having already taken place (comp. <a href="../../par/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>, "Believe in the light, that ye may be (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) the children of light"). As Alford says, the aorist seems to imply "that the aim was not the procedure, but the completion, of that indicated; not the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the carrying on the process, but the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, its accomplishment." The end of God's gift is the complete accomplishment of his gracious purpose, but it is only by continual growth that the Christian attains at length to that accomplishment. St. Peter's words seem very bold; but they do not go beyond many other statements of Holy Scripture. At the beginning God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." St. Paul tells us that believers are now "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-49.htm">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>, etc.). Christians, born of God (<a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>), are made "partakers of Christ" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>), "partakers of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>). Christ prayed for us that we might be "made perfect in one" with himself who is one with God the Father, through the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost the Comforter (<a href="../../par/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17, 23</a>). The second person is used to imply that the promises made to all Christians (unto <span class="accented">us</span>) belong to those whom St. Peter now addresses. <span class="cmt_word">Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust;</span> literally, <span class="accented">having escaped from the corruption that is in the world in lust.</span> These words express the negative side of the Christian life, the former clause describing its active and positive side. God's precious promises realized in the soul enable the Christian to become partakers of the Divine nature, and to escape from corruption; the two aspects of the Christian life must go on simultaneously; each implies and requires the other. Bengel says, "Haec fuga non tam ut officium nostrum, quam ut beneficium divinum, communionem cum Deo comitans, hoc loco ponitur." The verb used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only in this Epistle. It reminds us of St. Paul's words in <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>, "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption." The corruption or destruction  (for the Word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> has both those meanings) from which we must escape has its seat and power in lust; working secretly in the lusts of men's wicked hearts, it manifests its evil presence in the world (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And beside this, giving all diligence;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but for this very cause also.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is frequently used in this sense in classical Greek, but in the New Testament only here. It refers back to the last verse. God's precious gifts and promises should stimulate us to earnest effort. The verb rendered "giving" means literally "bringing in by the side;" it is one of those graphic and picturesque expressions which are characteristic of St. Peter's style. God worketh within us both to will and to do; this (both St. Paul and St. Peter teach us) is a reason, not for remissness, but for increased exertion. God's grace is sufficient for us; without that we can do nothing; but by the side (so to speak) of that grace, along with it, we must bring into play all earnestness, we must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. The word seems to imply that the work is God's work; we can do very little indeed, but that very little we must do, and for the very reason that God is working in us. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Add to your faith virtue;</span> literally, <span class="accented">supply in your faith.</span> He does not say, "supply faith;" he assumes the existence of faith. "He that cometh unto God must believe." The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) means properly to "contribute to the expenses of a chorus;" it is used three times by St. Paul, and, in its simple form, by St. Peter in his First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). In usage it came to mean simply to "supply or provide," the thought of the chorus being dropped. So we cannot be sure that the idea of faith as leading the mystic dance in the chorus of Christian graces was present to St. Peter's mind, especially as the word occurs again in verse 11, where no such allusion is possible. The fruits of faith are in the faith which produces them, as a tree is in its seed; they must be developed out of faith, as faith expands and energizes; in the exercise of each grace a fresh grace must issue forth. Virtue is well described by Bengel as "strenuus animi tonus et vigor;" it is Christian manliness and active courage in the good fight of faith. The word "virtue" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>), with the exception of <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter - in this chapter three times, and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, thus forming one of the kinks between the two Epistles. <span class="cmt_word">And to virtue knowledge.</span> St. Peter here uses the simple word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, discretion, a right understanding, "quae malam a bono secernit, et mali fugam docet" (Bengel). This practical knowledge is gained in the manly self-denying activities of the Christian life, and leads on to the fuller knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ (verse 8).

This self-control extends over the whole of life, and consists in the government of all the appetites; it must be learned in the exercise of that practical knowledge which discerns between good and evil. True knowledge leads on to self-control, to that perfect freedom which consists in the service of God; not to that liberty promised by the false teachers, which is licentiousness. <span class="cmt_word">And to temperance patience; and to patience godliness.</span> The practice of self-control will result in patient endurance; but that endurance will not be mere stoicism; it will be a conscious submission of our human will to the holy will of God, and so will tend to develop and strengthen <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, reverence and piety towards God (see note on verse 3).

"In your godliness," St. Peter says, "ye must develop brotherly kindness, the unfeigned love of the brethren;" for "every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him" (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>). And as God is loving unto every man, and "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," so Christians, who are taught to be followers (imitators) of God (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>), must learn in the exercise of love toward the brethren that larger love which embraces all men in an ever-widening circle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Thus love, the greatest of all Christian graces (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), is the climax in St. Peter's list. Out of faith, the root, spring the seven fair fruits of holiness, of which holy love is the fairest and the sweetest (comp. Ignatius, 'Ad Ephes.,' 14. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>). No grace can remain alone; each grace, as it is gradually formed in the soul, tends to develop and strengthen others; all graces meet in that highest grace of charity, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before God. Bengel says well, "Praeseus quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit, subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit."

Here we know only in part, we see through a glass darkly; but that imperfect knowledge should be ever growing, increasing in fullness and distinctness (see chapter 2 Peter 3:18). The various graces of the Christian character, realized in the heart, will lead us on towards that fuller knowledge of Christ; if they are really ours, they will not allow us to be idle, they must bring forth the fruit of good works; and the life of righteousness by faith draws the Christian onwards in the knowledge of Christ: we learn to knew him by following him (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).

Such a man can only see the things which lie close around him - earth and earthly things; he cannot lift up his eyes by faith and behold "the land that is very far off;" he cannot "see the King in his beauty" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). The word for "short-sighted" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins; literally, <span class="accented">having incurred forgetfulness of the cleansing from his old sins.</span> St. Peter is apparently thinking of the one baptism for the remission of sin. Ananias had said to Saul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins" (<a href="../../par/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>); St. Peter himself had said, in his first great sermon, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Those who do not realize in the religious life that death unto sin of which holy baptism is the sign and the beginning, incur forgetfulness of the cleansing from sin which they then received; they do not use the grace once given for the attainment of those higher graces of which St. Peter has been speaking. The one talent once entrusted to them must be taken from them; they are idle and unfruitful, and cannot reach unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "give diligence," recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "all diligence," of verse 5. The aorist seems, as it were, to sum up the continued diligence of daily life into one vivid description. This is the only place in which St. Peter uses the vocative "brethren;" he has "beloved" in the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>) and in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8</a>. Both words imply affectionate exhortation. Two ancient manuscripts, the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic, insert here, "Through your good works (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">To make your calling and election sure.</span> Alford calls attention to the middle voice of the verb, "Not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which lay beyond their power, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, on their side, for their part. But the verb must not be explained away into a pure subjectivity, 'to make sure to yourselves;' it carries the reflexive force, but only in so far as the act is and must be done for and <span class="accented">quoad</span> a man's own self, the absolute and final determination resting with Another." The calling and election are the act of God (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). All the baptized, all who bear the name of Christ, are called into the Church, but few comparatively are chosen, elect (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>). We look, as it were, from far below up to the mysteries of God's sovereign government; we cannot read the list of blessed names written in the Lamb's book of life; we cannot lift ourselves to a point high enough to comprehend the secrets of God's dealing with mankind, and to reconcile the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence with the free agency of man. But we feel the energy of that free agency within us; we know that Holy Scripture bids us to work out our salvation, and tells us of some who receive the grace of God in vain (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>), or frustrate the grace of God (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>); and we feel that when  the apostle tells us to make our calling and election sure, he means that we must try to realize that calling and election, to bring its solemn responsibilities and its blessed hopes to bear upon our daily life, to live as men who have been called into God's Church, who are elect unto eternal life, and so (if we may dare to say it) to ratify God's election by our poor acceptance. He calls us into covenant with himself; we answer, as the children of Israel said at Mount Sinai, "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>). Our obedience makes the covenant sure to us; holiness of life is the proof of God's election, for it implies the indwelling presence of "that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." <span class="cmt_word">For if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</span> "If ye do these things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "If ye make your calling and election sure." "The plural shows that the apostle considered this making sure a very many-sided act" (Dietlein, in Huther). Others refer the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "these things," to the graces just enumerated. <span class="accented">Ye shall never fall</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ye shall never stumble</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to strike one's foot against some obstacle," and so to stumble. St. James says, "In many things we offend (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) all" (<a href="../../par/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). St. Peter here means to stumble so as to fall (<a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); while Christians "do these things," while they make their calling and election sure by holiness of life, they cannot stumble; it is in unguarded moments that they fall into temptation.

Compare the use of the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, speaks, like St. Peter here, of <span class="accented">putting off a</span> tabernacle or tent as we talk of putting off a garment.   Alford quotes Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:08. 2, where Moses says, "Since I must depart from life, I have thought it right not even now to lay aside my zeal for your happiness." The word used here for "putting off" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is one of the links between the two Epistles; it occurs also in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me;</span> better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">signified unto me.</span> The aorist points to a definite time. St. Peter is thinking of our Lord's prophecy, which St. John afterwards recorded (<a href="../../par/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>); he could never forget that touching interview; he had already referred to it once in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>.

St. Peter will not only stir up the minds of his readers during his life, but he will give diligence to enable them to call to remembrance, after his death, the truths which he had preached. These words may refer simply to the present Epistle; but it seems more natural to understand them of an intention to commit to writing the facts of the gospel history; if this be so, we have here a confirmation of the ancient tradition that the Second Gospel was written by St. Mark at the dictation of St. Peter. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is that used in verse 10, and should be translated in the same way; they must give diligence to make their calling and election sure. St. Peter, for his part, will give diligence to furnish them with a lasting record of the truths of Christianity. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, at every time, whenever there may be need, occurs only here in the New Testament. (For <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "to be able," compare the Greek of <a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>.) It is remarkable that we have here, in two consecutive verses, two words which remind us of the history of the Transfiguration, "tabernacle," and "decease" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; see <a href="../../par/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). Then Peter proposed to make three tabernacles; then he heard Moses and Elijah speaking of the Lord's decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. The simple unconscious occurrence of these coincidences is a strong proof of the genuineness of our Epistle; it is inconceivable that an imitator of the second century should have shown this delicate skill in adapting his production to the circumstances of the supposed writer. The last words of the verse may mean (and in classical Greek would mean) "to make mention of these things;" but the usual rendering seems more suitable here. St. Peter was anxious rather that his readers should have the truths of the gospel living in their memories, than that they should talk about them; that would follow as a matter of course: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Some Roman Catholic commentators think that this passage contains a promise that the apostle would still, after his death, continue to remember the needs of the Church on earth, and to help them by his intercessions; but this interpretation involves a complete dislocation of clauses, and cannot possibly be the true meaning of the words.

This compound verb is used only by St. Peter in the New Testament; we find it again in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a> and 15. Bengel and others have thought that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, from or out of, implies wandering from the truth after false guides; but probably the word merely means "to follow closely," though in this case the guides were going astray. Perhaps the use of the plural number is accounted for by the fact that St. Peter was not the only witness of the glory of the Transfiguration; he associates in thought his two brother-apostles with himself. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, fables, with this exception, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles. There is a remarkable parallel in the procemium of the 'Antiquities' of Josephus, sect. 4, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter may be referring to the "Jewish fables" mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>), or to the stories about the heathen gods such as those in Hesiod and Ovid, or possibly to some early inventions, such as those ascribed to Simon the Sorcerer, which were afterwards to be developed into the strange fictions of Gnosticism (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>). The word rendered "cunningly devised" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; but there a different part of the verb is used, and in a different sense. <span class="cmt_word">When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter can scarcely be referring to St. Paul or other missionaries, as the following words identify the preachers with the witnesses of the Transfiguration; he must be alluding either to his First Epistle (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>), or to personal teaching of his which has not been recorded, or, just possibly, to the Gospel of St. Mark. St. Peter had seen the power of the Lord Jesus manifested in his miracles; he had heard the announcement  of the risen Saviour, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" he had, like the rest of the apostles, been "endued with power from on high." By the coming (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) he must mean the second advent, the invariable meaning of the word in Holy Scripture (see chapter 2 Peter 3:4, <a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> The word for "eye-witnesses" is not the common one (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, used by St. <a href="../../par/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>), but a technical word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which in classical Greek designates the highest class of those who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. The choice of such a word may possibly imply that St. Peter regarded himself and his brother-apostles as having received the highest initiation into the mysteries of religion. The noun is found only here in the New Testament; but the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a> and 1 Pet 3:2, and in no other of the New Testament writers. Here again we have an undesigned coincidence which points to identity of authorship. The word for "majesty" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in St. Luke's description of the healing of the demoniac boy immediately after the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>), and elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he received from God the Father honour and glory.</span> The construction here is interrupted; the literal translation is, "Having received," etc., and there is no verb to complete the sense. Winer supposes that the apostle had intended to continue with some such words as, "He had us for witnesses," or, "He was declared to be the beloved Son of God," and that the construction was interrupted by the direct quotation of the words spoken by the voice from heaven ('Grammar,' 3:45, b). (For a similar anacoluthon, see in the Greek <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>.) "Honour" seems to refer to the testimony of the voice from heaven; "glory," to the splendour of the Lord's transfigured Person. <span class="cmt_word">When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">when such a voice was borne to him.</span> The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of "the <span class="accented">rushing</span> mighty wind" which announced the coming of the Holy Ghost; and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> of "the grace which is being brought." It is repeated in the next verse. It seems intended to assert emphatically the real objective character of the voice. It was not a vision, a dream; the voice was borne from heaven; the apostles heard it with their ears. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> must be rendered "by," not "from." The "excellent" (rather, "majestic," or "magnificent") glory was the Shechinah, the visible manifestation of the presence of God, which had appeared in ancient times on Mount Sinai, and in the tabernacle and temple above the mercy-seat. God was there; it was he who spoke. For the word rendered "excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) compare the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the Majestic One of the firmament;" where our Authorized Version gives a more exact translation of the Hebrew, "in his excellency on the sky" (see also the 'Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,' chapter 9, where the occurrence of the same remarkable words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, suggests that Clement must have been acquainted with this Epistle). This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Our translation makes these words correspond exactly with the report given by St. Matthew in his account of the Transfiguration, except that "hear ye him" is added there. In the Greek there are some slight variations. According to one ancient manuscript (the Vatican), the order of the words is different, and there is a second pen, "This is my Son, my Beloved." All uncial manuscripts have here, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> of St. Matthew's Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. The difference cannot be represented in our translation. The construction is pregnant, and the meaning is that from all eternity the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the good pleasure, of God the Father was directed towards the Divine Son, and still abideth on him. The same truth seems to be implied in the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"). An imitator of the second century would certainly have made this quotation to correspond exactly with the words as given in one of the synoptic Gospels.

Mount Horeb was "holy ground," because God appeared there to Moses, because it was the scene of the giving of the Law. Mount Zion was a holy hill, because God had chosen it to be a habitation for himself; the Mount of the Transfiguration was holy, because there God the Son manifested forth his glory. God hallows every place which he pleases to make the scene of his revealed presence. This whole passage shows the deep and  lasting impression which the Transfiguration made on those who were privileged to witness it (comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have also a more sure word of prophecy;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and we have the word of prophecy made more sure</span>; or, <span class="accented">we have the word of prophecy more sure</span> (than the testimony of the heavenly voice). The rendering of the Authorized Version is ungrammatical; we must adopt one of the other modes of representing the original. The second seems to be preferred by most commentators. Thus Archdeacon Farrar, translating the passage, "And still stronger is the surety we have in the prophetic word," adds in a note, "Why more sure? Because wider in its range, and more varied, and coming from many, and bringing a more intense personal conviction than the testimony to a single fact." But when St. Peter applied the epithet "surer" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to the word of prophecy, does he mean in his own estimate of it, or in that of others? If he is speaking of himself, it is surely inconceivable that any possible testimony to the truth of the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ could be comparable with the commanding authority of the Divine voice which he himself had heard borne from heaven, and the transcendent glory which he himself had seen flashing from the Saviour's human form and bathing it in an aureole of celestial light. That heavenly voice had made the deepest possible impression on the apostles. "They fell on their faces," as Moses had done under the like circumstances, recognizing it as the voice of God. Peter had said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here;" and evidently all through his life he felt that it was good for him to dwell in solemn thought on the treasured memories of that august revelation. No written testimony could be "surer" to St. Peter than that voice from heaven. But is he rather thinking of the confirmation of the faith of his readers? He is still using the first person plural, as in verses 16 and 18; in this verse, indeed, he passes to the second; but the retaining of the first person in the first clause of the verse shows that, if he is not still speaking of apostles only, he at least includes himself among those who have the word of prophecy; and to him certainly the testimony of that word, though sacred and precious, could not be "surer" than the testimony of the heavenly voice. To Jewish Christians the evidence of the prophets of the Old Testament was of supreme importance. Nathanael, the "Israelite indeed," was drawn to the Lord by the assurance that, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, did write." The Lord himself insisted again and again upon the testimony of the prophets; so did his apostles after him. Still, it seems difficult to understand that, even to Jewish Christians, the testimony of the prophets, however sacred and weighty, could be surer than that of those apostles who made known the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, having been eye-witnesses of his majesty; while to Gentile Christians the testimony of those apostles of the Lamb who declared "what they had heard, what they had seen with their eyes, what their hands had handled, of the Word of life," must have had greater power to convince than the predictions of the Hebrew prophets, though these predictions, fulfilled as they were in the Lord Jesus, furnish subsidiary evidence of exceeding value. On the whole, the more probable meaning of St. Peter seems to be that the word of prophecy was made more sure to himself, and, through his teaching, to others by the overwhelming testimony of the voice from heaven and the glory of the Transfiguration. He had become a disciple long before. His brother Andrew had first told him that Jesus was the Messiah; he himself, a week before the Transfiguration, had confessed him solemnly to be "the Christ, the Son of the living God? But the Transfiguration deepened that faith into the most intense conviction; it made the word of prophecy which spoke of Christ surer and more certain. It is not without interest that the writer of the so-called 'Second Epistle of Clement' quotes (chapter 11) from "the prophetic word" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), passages which resemble <a href="../../par/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> and <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. There is a parallel to the first clause of this in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 11:6, 12; to the second in 2 Esdr. 12:42. The word rendered "light" is rather a lamp or torch; our Lord uses it of John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). The word translated "dark" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is found only here in the New Testament; it means "dry, parched, and so squalid, desert;" there seems to be no sufficient authority for the rendering "dark." God's Word is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path; the word of prophecy guides us to Christ. Until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts; literally, <span class="accented">until day dawn through</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "through the gloom." There is no article. The word for "day-star" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>v, lucifer, light-bringer) is found in no other place of the New Testament; but comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>. St. Peter seems to mean that the prophetic word, rendered more sure to the apostles by the voice from heaven, and to Christians generally by apostolic witness, shines like a guiding   lamp, till the fuller light of day dawns upon the soul, as the believer, led by the prophetic word, realizes the personal knowledge of the Lord, and he manifests himself according to his blessed promises to the heart that longs for his sacred presence. He is the Bright and Morning Star, the Day-star, the Light-bringer; for he is the Light of the world - he brings the light, the full light of day. The prophetic word is precious; it sheds light upon the surrounding darkness  - the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of the heart that knows not Christ; but its light is as the light of a torch or a lamp, compared with the pervading daylight which the felt presence of Christ sheds into those hearts into which God hath shined to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>). Some understand "day" here of the great day of the Lord. Against this interpretation is the absence of the article, and the fact that the last words of the verse seem to give a subjective meaning to the passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.</span> By "knowing this first" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is meant that we must recognize this truth as of primary importance, or, before we commence the study of prophecy; the phrase occurs again in chapter 2 Peter 3:3. The literal translation of the following clause is, "that all prophecy of Scripture [there is no article] is not; all...  not" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>) being a common Hebraism for none, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but the verb is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "is," but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "becomes, arises, comes into being." The word for "private" is <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "special," or commonly, "one's own" (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5</a>; chapter 2 Peter 2:16, 22; 3:3, 16, 17). The word rendered "interpretation" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is found nowhere else in the New Testament; the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="../../par/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>, "He expounded all things;" and <a href="../../par/acts/19-39.htm">Acts 19:39</a>, "It shall be determined or settled." These considerations, strengthened by the context, seem to guide us to the following explanation: No prophecy of Scripture arises from the prophet's own interpretation of the vision presented to his mind; for it was from God that the prophecy was brought, and men spoke as they were borne on by the Holy Spirit. This view of the passage is also supported by the remarkable parallel in the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>). The prophets searched diligently into the meaning of the revelation vouchsafed to them; they did not always comprehend it in all its details; they could not interpret it to themselves; the written prophecy arose out of the interpretation of the revelation supplied by the same Spirit from whom the revelation itself proceeded. Therefore the prophetic books of Holy Scripture are sacred and precious, and we do well in giving heed to them; though the day-star of the Lord's own presence, shining in the illuminated heart, is holier still. Other views of this difficult passage are: Prophecy is not its own interpreter; the guidance of the Spirit is necessary. Or, prophecy is not a matter for the private interpretation of the readers; only the Holy Spirit can explain it. But the explanation adopted seems most accordant with the Greek words and with the general sense of the context (compare St. Paul's teaching in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). The gifts of the Spirit are divided as he will; to one man are given "divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues." Not every one, it seems, who had the first gift, had also the latter. Tongues and the interpretation of tongues were two distinct gifts. It may be so with prophecy and the interpretation of prophecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man;</span> literally, for <span class="accented">not by the will of man was prophecy borne at any time.</span> The verb is that already used in verses 17, 18, "was not borne or brought;" it refers not to the utterance of prophecy, but to its origin - it came from heaven. <span class="cmt_word">But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but being borne on by the Holy Ghost, the holy men of God spake</span>; or, if we follow the Vatican Manuscript, "But being borne on by the Holy Ghost, men spake from God." We have again the same verb, "being borne on" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/acts/27-15.htm">Acts 27:15, 17</a>, where it is used of a ship being borne on by the wind. So the prophets were borne on in their prophetic utterance by the Holy Spirit of God. They were truly and really inspired. The mode of that inspiration is not explained; perhaps it cannot be made plain to our human understanding; all the points of contact between the finite and the Infinite are involved in mystery. But the fact is clearly revealed - the prophets were borne on by the Holy Spirit of God. This is not, as some have fancied, the language of Montanism. Prophecy is but a lamp shining in a dark place; it is not the day-star. Prophecy came not by the will of man; the prophets were moved or borne on by the Holy Ghost. But St. Peter does not say that their human consciousness was suspended, or that they were passive as the lyre when swept by the plectrum. Had this passage been written after the rise of Montanism early in the second century, the writer, if a Montanist, would have said more; if not a Montanist, he would have carefully guarded his words from possible misunderstanding.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_peter/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Peter 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Peter 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_peter/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Peter 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Peter 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm"><title>2 Peter 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_peter/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_peter/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_peter/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_peter/1.htm" title="2 Peter 1">&#9668;</a> 2 Peter 2 <a href="../2_peter/3.htm" title="2 Peter 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there were false prophets also among the people;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">but there arose false prophets also among the people.</span> The transition is simple and natural. Besides the true prophets mentioned in the last chapter, who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, there arose false prophets, men who wore "a rough garment to deceive" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>), and assumed without warrant the prophetic character. Such pretenders would commonly prophesy false things; but the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems principally to imply the absence of a Divine mission. By "the people" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is meant the people of Israel, as in <a href="../../par/romans/15-11.htm">Romans 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>, etc. It is plain from these words that St. Peter, at the end of the last chapter, was speaking of the prophets of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies.</span> By the false teachers, again (the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is peculiar to St. Peter), may be meant men whose teaching was false, or men who falsely claimed the teacher's office. St. Peter describes them as such as (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)  shall bring in damnable heresies. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only here in the New Testament; the adjective derived from it is used by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>, "false brethren unawares brought in." It means "to bring in by the side of," as if these false teachers brought in their errors by the side of the true doctrine; it implies also the secondary notion of secrecy. Compare St. Jude's use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, compounded with the same prepositions (verse 4); and notice the difference of tenses - St. Jude using the past where St. Peter looks forward to the future; but St. Peter passes to the present tense in verse 10, and maintains it for the rest of the chapter. We may, perhaps, infer that the false teaching referred to was already beginning to affect the Churches of Asia Minor; but the errors were not so much developed there, the' false teachers had not gained so much influence as it seems they had in the Churches which St. Jude had principally in his thoughts. The literal translation of the words rendered "damnable heresies" is "heresies of destruction," the last word being the same which occurs again at the end of the verse. These heresies destroy the soul; they bring ruin both to those who are led astray and to the false teachers themselves. The word for "heresy"(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), meaning originally "choice," became the name for a party, sect, or school, as in <a href="../../par/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "the sect of the Sadducees;" <a href="../../par/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>," the sect of the Pharisees;" <a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a> (in the mouth of Tertullus). "the sect of the Nazarenes;" then, by a natural transition, it came to be used of the opinions held by a sect. The notion of self-will, deliberate separation, led to its being employed generally in a bad sense (see especially <a href="../../par/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>, "A man that is a heretic, (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>)")<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even denying the Lord that bought them;</span> literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">denying even the Master that bought them.</span> The word for "Master" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) implies that the deniers stand to the Lord in the relation of slaves, bondservants. The Lord had bought them; they were not their own, but his, bought with a price, "not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; see also the parallel passage <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). These words plainly assert the universality of the Lord's redemption. He "tasted death for every man" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), even for those false teachers who denied him. The denial referred to may have been doctrinal or practical; most of the ancient forms of heresy involved some grave error as to the Person of Christ; and the germs of these errors appeared very early in the Church (see <a href="../../par/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22, 23</a>), denying sometimes the Godhead of our Lord, sometimes the truth of his humanity. But St. Peter may mean the practical denial of Christ evinced in an ungodly and licentious life. The latter form of denial appears most prominent in this chapter; probably the apostle intended to warn his readers against both. It is touching to remember that he had himself denied the Lord, though indeed the price with which our souls were bought had not then been paid; but his denial was at once followed by a deep and true repentance. The Lord's loving look recalled him to himself; his bitter tears proved the sincerity of his contrition. <span class="cmt_word">And bring upon themselves swift destruction;</span> literally, <span class="accented">bringing.</span> The participial construction unites the two clauses closely; the latter expresses the consequence of the former: they bring heresies of destruction into the Church, and by so doing bring upon themselves swift destruction. The word for "swift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is used by no other New Testament writer. There is an apparent allusion to this verso in Justin Martyr ('Cum Tryph.,' 82), and the first clause of it is quoted in a homily ascribed to Hippolytus of Portus. Notice St. Peter's habit of repetition, he repeats the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> three times in verses 1-3; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> three times in verses 7, 8; the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> three times in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12-14</a>, etc.

The expression, "way of truth," occurs in the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' chapter 5. Christianity is called "the way" several times in the Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>, etc.). It is the way of truth, because Christ, who is the Center of his religion, is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; because it is the way of life which is founded on the truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in covetousness.</span> Covetousness was their besetting sin, the sphere in which they lived. St. Paul warned Titus against false teachers who taught "things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake" (<a href="../../par/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a> and <a href="../../par/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). Simon Magus, the first heresiarch, sought to trade in holy things; the like sin seems to have been characteristic of the false teachers of apostolic times. The word translated "feigned" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; the  words of these men were not the expression of their real thoughts and feelings; they were invented, craftily contrived to deceive men, and that for the sake of money. The last words of the clause will admit another sense: "shall gain you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall gain you over to their party;" and this view derives some support from the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>. But the verb is often used in classical writers in the sense of making a profit out of people or things, and this meaning seems most suitable here. The false teachers will work hard, as the Pharisees did, to make proselytes; but their real motive <span class="accented">is</span>, not the salvation of souls, but their own selfish gain. <span class="cmt_word">Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for whom the sentence of a long time idleth not.</span> The sentence of judgment is for them, for their condemnation; in the foreknowledge of God it has been pronounced long ago, and ever since it has been drawing near; it doth not tarry (comp. <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). The word rendered "of a long time" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs only here and <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And their damnation slumbereth not;</span> <span class="accented">destruction:</span> it is the word which has been used already twice in verse 1. The verb means literally "to nod," then "to slumber;" it is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in the parable of the virgins (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-5.htm">Matthew 25:5</a>).

St. Peter is giving proofs of his assertion that the punishment of the ungodly lingereth not. The first is the punishment of angels that sinned. He does not specify the sin, whether rebellion, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>; or uncleanness, as apparently in <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6, 7</a>, and <a href="../../par/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>. Formally, there is an anacoluthon here, but in thought we have the apodosis in verse 9. <span class="cmt_word">But cast them down to hell.</span> The Greek word, which is found nowhere else in the Greek Scriptures, is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having cast into Tartarus." This use of a word belonging to heathen mythology is very remarkable, and without parallel in the New Testament. (The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in the Septuagint, <a href="../../par/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>. Compare also the Septuagint rendering of the name of Job's daughter Keren-Happuch, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the horn of Amalthaea; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>.) Apparently, St. Peter regards Tartarus not as equivalent to Gehenna, for the sinful angels are "reserved unto judgment," but as a place of preliminary detention. Josephus, quoted by Professor Lumby in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' speaks of the oldest heathen gods as fettered in Tartarus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ('Contra Apion,' 2:33). And delivered them into chains of darkness. The Revised Version "pits" represents the reading of the four oldest manuscripts; but the variations in two of them (the Sinaitic and Alexandrine have <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> seems properly to mean a pit for the storage of corn, throw some doubt upon this reading. The other reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, cords, may possibly have arisen from the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, though the Greek word for "chains" is different there. The chains consist in darkness; the pits are in darkness, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, delivered, is often used, as Huther remarks, with the implied idea of punishment. It is simpler to connect the chains or pits of darkness with this verb than (as Fronmuller and others) with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having cast them in bonds of darkness into Tartarus" (comp. Wisd. 17:2, 16, 17). To be reserved unto judgment; literally, <span class="accented">being reserved</span>; but the readings here are very confused. St. Jude says (verse 6) that the sinful angels are reserved <span class="accented">"unto</span> the judgment of the great day." Bengel says, "Possunt autem in terra quoque versari mancipia Tartari (<a href="../../par/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; etc.) sic ut bello captus etiam extra locum captivitatis potest ambulare." But in the case of a mystery of which so little has been revealed, we are scarcely justified in assuming the identity of the angels cast into Tartarus with the evil spirits who tempt and harass us on earth.

In verse 1 the ungodly are represented as bringing upon themselves swift destruction; here God brings the punishment upon them. The same Greek verb is used in both places. In one place St. Peter gives the human, in the other the Divine, aspect of the same events (comp. Clement I, 7 and 9).

The literal translation is, "was tormenting his righteous soul." The sight of lawless deeds and the sound of wicked words were a daily grief to Lot. He distressed himself; he felt the guilt and danger of his neighbours, the dishonour done to God, and his own unhappy choice. St. Peter cannot mean (as OEcumenius and Theophylact suppose) that Lot's affliction was caused by the sustained effort to resist the temptation of falling into the like vices himself. The Greek words for "seeing" and "dwelling among" occur only here in the New Testament.

The three examples cited by St. Peter show that the Lord knows (and with the Lord knowledge involves power) how to deliver the righteous and to punish the wicked. The Greek words for "godly" and "unjust" are both without the article. The word rendered "to be punished" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a present participle, not future, and is better rendered, as in the Revised Version, "under punishment." The wicked are already under punishment while awaiting the judgment; the Lord had taught this in the parable of Dives and Lazarus (comp. also <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6, 7</a>, and verse 4 of this chapter). Aristotle makes a distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the first being "chastisement inflicted for the good of those chastised;" the second, "punishment inflicted on the incorrigible for the satisfaction of justice" (see 'Rhet.,' 1:10); but it is doubtful whether this distinction exists in the New Testament (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>). Therefore it seems dangerous to lay much stress on the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> here (comp.

Here it seems to stand for all forms of authority. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities; literally, <span class="accented">daring, self-willed, they tremble not when speaking evil of glories</span>; or, <span class="accented">they fear not glories, blaspheming.</span> The word rendered "daring" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. These daring, self-willed men despise all lordship, all glories, whether the glory of Christ ("the excellent glory," <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>), or the glory of the angels, or the glory of holiness, or the glory of earthly sovereignty. The next verse, however, makes it probable that the glory of the angels was the thought present to St. Peter's mind. It may be that, as some false teachers had inculcated the worship of angels (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), others had gone to the opposite extreme (comp. <a href="../../par/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>).

The literal rendering of the following words, "angels being greater," makes it probable that the comparison is with the false teachers of the previous verse rather than with the "glories." The false teachers rail at glories, where angels, though greater than they, bring not a railing judgment against those glories. It seems certain that the words "against them" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must refer to the "glories," and cannot mean, according to the Vulgate, <span class="accented">adversum se.</span> Men rail at these glories; but the elect angels, when they are commissioned to proclaim or inflict the just judgment (for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "judgment," not" accusation") of God upon the angels that sinned, the fallen glories, do not rail; they remember what those lost spirits once were, and speak solemnly and sorrowfully, not in coarse, violent language. The apostle may be alluding to <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>, but the resemblance to <a href="../../par/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8, 9</a> is so dose that this last passage must have been in his thoughts, even if he is not directly referring to the dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil. Luther's interpretation (adopted by Fronmuller and others), that the <span class="accented">wicked</span> angels are not able to bear the judgment of God upon their blasphemy, cannot be extracted from the words. The Alexandrine Manuscript omits "before the Lord;" but these words are well supported.

This reading is adopted by the Revised Version in the translation, "suffering wrong as the hire of wrongdoing." But the other reading is well supported, and gives a better sense, "receiving, as they shall, the reward of unrighteousness." Balaam loved the reward of unrighteousness in this world (verse 15); the false teachers shall receive its final reward in the world to come. Whichever reading is preferred, this clause is best taken with the preceding verse.

St. John connects his name with the Nicolaitanes in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-15.htm">Revelation 2:15</a>, much as St. Peter here connects it with the false teachers of his time. Some, again, see in the etymology of the word "Nicolaitane" an allusion to that of "Balaam," as if the Nicolaitanes were followers of Balaam. There is another explanation in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the word "Bosor" is an Aramaic form, and that "the form possibly became familiar to St. Peter during his residence at Babylon, and suggests the probability that Aramaic traditions were still current respecting Balaam at the Christian era, and on the banks of the Euphrates" (additional note on Numbers 22:5). But the two oldest manuscripts read "Beer" here. Who loved the wages of unrighteousness (comp. verse 13, and also St. Peter's words in <a href="../../par/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>). Balaam is not definitely accused of covetousness in the Old Testament narrative; but his conduct can be explained by no other motive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But was rebuked for his iniquity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but had a rebuke for his own transgression.</span> The word for "rebuke" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) Occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The guilt of offering the wages of unrighteousness rested with Balak; Balaam's own transgression lay in his readiness to accept them - in his willingness to break the law of God by cursing, for filthy lucre's sake, those whom God had not cursed. The dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet. The word for "ass" is literally "beast of burden" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as  in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). "Dumb" is literally "without voice;" naturally without voice, it spake with the voice of man. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, rendered "forbade," is rather "checked," or "stayed." The word for "madness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The ass checked the prophet's folly by her shrinking from the angel, and by the miracle that followed; the angel, while permitting Balaam to expose himself to the danger into which he had fallen by tempting the Lord, forbade any deviation from the word to be put into his mouth by God. Balaam obeyed in the letter; but afterwards the madness which had been checked for the moment led him into deadly sin (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). We observe that St. Peter assumes the truthfulness of the narrative in the Book of Numbers (see Mr. Clark's note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28</a>).

They are like wells without water; they deceive men with a promise which they do not fulfill. In <a href="../../par/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a> there is a slight difference - "clouds without water" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clouds that are carried with a tempest;</span> better, <span class="accented">mists driven by a tempest.</span> The best manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, mists, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, clouds; they are driven along by the tempest; they give no water to the thirsty land, but only bring darkness and obscurity. The Greek word for "tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>) is used by St. Mark and St. Luke in their account of the tempest on the Sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for over;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the blackness of darkness.</span> The words are the same as those of <a href="../../par/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a> (comp. verse 4 of this chapter; also <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where the same verb is used of the inheritance <span class="accented">reserved</span> in heaven for the saints). The words "for ever" are omitted in the Vatican and Sinaitic Manuscripts; it is possible that they may have been inserted from the parallel passage in St. Jude; but they are well supported here.

This last reading gives a better sense, "Those who are just escaping." The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> may be understood of time, or, perhaps better, of measure - "escaping by a little, a little way." Those who were "clean escaped "would not be so easily enticed by the false teachers. These are only beginning to escape; they have heard the word with joy, but have no root in themselves; they put their hand to the plough, but they look back. They "that live in error" are the heathen; the unhappy men who are led astray by the false teachers are just escaping from the heathen and from their mode of life. It is possible to understand these last words as a coordinate clause, a further description of those who are just escaping. The false teachers entice "those who are just escaping, those who live in error." But the common rendering seems better. The verb translated "live" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a favourite word with St. Peter (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 2, 16</a>).

Liberty was the subject of their great swelling words of vanity; they talked loudly, made a great boast, about liberty. Perhaps they were wresting to their own destruction (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15, 16</a>) the teaching of St. Paul concerning Christian liberty. St. Paul had spoken of the liberty of the glory of the children of God (<a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>); he had again and again asserted the liberty of Christians in things indifferent (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>, etc.). But he had insisted on the paramount duty of giving no offence (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>, etc.), and had earnestly cautioned his converts to "use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh." There were false teachers who maintained that the true Gnostic was free from moral restraints, in fact, that liberty meant libertinism, liberty to sin (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). They themselves are the servants of corruption. The construction is still participial, "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) being from the beginning servants of corruption. Those who talked about liberty were themselves all the time the bondservants, the slaves, of corruption. The  word rendered "corruption" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span>cludes the sense of" destruction," as in verse 12 and <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</span> "Of whom," or "by whatever;" by Satan, the personal tempter, or by sin, the innate tendency; the Greek word will bear either meaning. Some good manuscripts add "also," which strengthens the assertion; "is he also brought in bondage." St. Peter's teaching corresponds exactly with that of St. Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>. There is a very close parallel to this clause in the 'Clementine Recognitions' (5:12; quoted by Dr. Salmon, in his 'Historical Introduction to the Books of the New Testament'): "unusquisque illius fit servus cui se ipse subjecerit." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20</a></div><div class="verse">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for if, having escaped</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). Is St. Peter in this verse still speaking of the false teachers, or of those whom they had enticed (verse 18)? Bengel, Fronmuller, and others take the latter view, thinking that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("those having escaped") of this verse must be the same with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("those who are escaping," or "those having escaped") of verse 18. But it is far more natural to understand St, Peter as continuing his description of the false teachers. The conjunction "for" connects the clause closely with that immediately preceding, and suggests that St. Peter is explaining the term "bondservants or slaves" applied to the false teachers in verse 19; the repetition of the word "overcome" also seems to imply that the subjects of yore. 20 and 19 are the same. The word for" pollutions" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs only here. In 'Hermas' (Vis., 4:3, 2) there occurs what may be a reminiscence of this verse: "Ye who have escaped this world." Through the knowledge of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ. Several of the most ancient manuscripts read, "our Lord and Saviour." The word rendered "knowledge" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, full knowledge (comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-2.htm">2 Peter 1:2, 3, 8</a>; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The preposition is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>. The full, personal knowledge of the Saviour is the sphere in which the Christian lives; while he abides in that knowledge grace and peace are multiplied unto him, and he is enabled to escape the pollutions of the world. The apostle warns us here that some of those who once enjoyed the blessedness of that sacred knowledge have been entangled in sin and have fallen from grace. They are again entangled therein, and overcome. The first clause is participial; the connection seems to be, "If, having escaped...  but being again entangled they are overcome." The word "entangled" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) suggests the figure of fishes entangled in the meshes of a net, and seems to point back to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("entice") of verses 18 and 14; they entice others, but they are entangled themselves (comp. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>), and become captives and slaves to the pollutions of the world from which they had once escaped. The latter end is worse with them than the beginning; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the last state is become worse with them than the first.</span> This is a distinct quotation of our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/11-26.htm">Luke 11:26</a>. The evil spirit had been cast out from these men; for a time they had lived in the full knowledge of Christ; but now the evil spirit had returned, and had brought with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. This spontaneous adoption of our Lord's words without marks of quotation is not like the work of a forger.

St. Peter may be quoting <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>; but his words are  very different from the Septuagint Version of that passage; perhaps it is more probable that the expression had become proverbial, and that the apostle is referring to a form of it in common use with his readers; like that which follows, which is not in the Book of Proverbs. <span class="cmt_word">And the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the sow that had washed to her wallowing</span>; or, according to some ancient manuscripts, "her wallowing-place."

The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, vomit; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, wallowing; and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, mire, are not found elsewhere in the New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_peter/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Peter 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Peter 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_peter/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Peter 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Peter 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm"><title>2 Peter 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_peter/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_peter/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_peter/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_peter/2.htm" title="2 Peter 2">&#9668;</a> 2 Peter 3 <a href="../1_john/1.htm" title="1 John 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i>both</i> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This Second Epistle, beloved, I now write unto you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this Epistle already a second one I write unto you.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span> ("already") implies that the interval between the two Epistles was not long. The expression "beloved," four times repeated in this chapter, shows the apostle's affectionate interest in his readers; and the word "second" forces us to make our choice between the Petrine authorship of the Epistle or the hypothesis of a direct forgery. <span class="cmt_word">In both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in which, i.e.</span>, "Epistles;" the word "second" implied an allusion to a First Epistle. St. Peter repeats the words which he had used in chapter 2 Peter 1:13, "I think it meet...  to stir you up by putting you in remembrance." Mind (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is the reflective faculty (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>); that faculty should be exercised in holy things. The thoughts that pass through the Christian's mind should be holy thoughts; his mind should be pure. The word rendered "pure" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a> (where see note); the corresponding substantive is found in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>. It is said of things which can bear to be judged in the sunlight, and so means "pure, clear," or (according to another possible etymology) "unmixed," and so "genuine, sincere."

It is a remarkable expression; but Christ's apostles can be rightly called the apostles of those to whom they are sent, as being their teachers, sent to them for their benefit; just as the angels of God are called also the angels of Christ's little ones (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>). Compare also "the angels of the seven Churches" in the Revelation. St. Peter shows an intimate knowledge of several of St. Paul's Epistles, and of that of St. James; he is writing to the Churches addressed in his First Epistle, most of which were founded by St. Paul or his companions. We must therefore understand this passage, as well as verse 15 of this chapter, as a distinct recognition of the apostleship of St. Paul. The translation of the Authorized Version, "the apostles of the Lord and Saviour," involves a violent disturbance of the order; it seems best to make both genitives depend on "commandment:" "your apostles' commandment of the Lord;" the first genitive being that of announcement, the second of origin. The commandment was announced by the apostles, but it was the Lord's commandment. (For the double genitive, comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>.

St. Peter has the words, "knowing this first," in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>, where he is speaking of the interpretation of prophecy; he repeats them now when referring to the scoffers who mocked at the long delay of the Lord's coming foretold by the prophets. (For "the last days," see note on 1 Peter 1:20.) The Revised Version has, "Mockers shall come with mockery." This represents the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, found in nearly all the best manuscripts, which give emphasis to the expression after the Hebrew manner.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they were</i> from the beginning of the creation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, "Where is the God of judgment?"). The Lord had prophesied of his coming; St. Paul had spoken more than once as if that coming were very near at hand (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Yet he came not. Already men were beginning to mock, and to question whether the long-delayed promise  would ever be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">For since the fathers fell asleep;</span> better, <span class="accented">from the day that.</span> By "the fathers" must be meant here the fathers of the Christian Church. St. Peter was writing more than thirty years after the Ascension. The first generation of Christians was rapidly passing away. Stephen "fell asleep" first, then James the son of Zebedee, the other James the Lord's brother, and many others who had looked, it may be, to see the coming of the Lord among those "which are alive and remain" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). But they had died, and he came not; and from the day of their death things went on as they were. Should men look for him still, the mockers asked, when the fathers looked in vain? The mockers adopted, in mockery, doubtless, the Christian phrase for death. The Lord first had said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ;" then the holy Stephen "fell asleep;" and so "they which are asleep" became the recognized name for the dead in Christ. Death is like sleep; the holy dead rest from their labours. They "sleep not idly," for they are at home with the Lord, and they are blessed; but yet the quiet rest of Paradise, though "far better" than this earthly life, is sleep compared with the perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, which the redeemed of the Lord shall enjoy at last in his eternal glory. <span class="cmt_word">All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all things continue thus</span>, as they are, and as they have been from the beginning. There has been no sudden catastrophe; the world has gone on as it was; the laws of nature are still working with their changeless uniformity" (see a remarkable parallel in Clement, I, 23, which is important also as an independent proof that this argument of the scoffers is as old as the end of the first century). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this they willingly are ignorant of;</span> literally, for <span class="accented">this escapes them of their own will.</span> All things have not always been as they are; there have been great changes; there was once a great catastrophe; but this they willfully forget, Huther translates differently, "For, whilst they assert this, it is hidden from them that," etc. But this rendering seems forced and unsatisfactory, and gives a meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> which it has nowhere in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">That by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.</span> The Revised Version translates, <span class="accented">That there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the Word of God.</span> The mockers say that all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. That creation itself was a great, a stupendous change, a mighty effort of the power of God. St. Peter refers to it in words evidently derived from the Book of Genesis, not from any other sources, whether Greek, Egyptian, or Indian. There were heavens from of old (the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>). There was an earth formed or standing out of the water. The Greek participle here used is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, literally, "standing together or consisting" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>); it may be taken closely with both prepositional Clauses, "earth consisting of water and by means of water." Thales had taught that water was the beginning of things, the original element (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); the narrative in Genesis represents water as originally overspreading all things: "The earth was without form [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint], and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." We may therefore understand St. Peter as meaning that the earth was formed or compacted out of water, or out of those substances which the water at first held in solution; and that it is kept together in coherence and solidity by means of water. If, on the other hand, we regard the participle as closely connected with the second preposition only, the meaning will be that the earth, held together and compacted by means of water, rose up out of the water, and appeared above it, when God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." It is possible, again, to understand the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> locally, and to translate "amidst water." Comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>, "He stretched out the earth above the waters;" and <a href="../../par/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>, "He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods." Of course, neither St. Peter nor Moses is speaking in the language of science; their object was, not to teach scientific truth, but to present the great fact of creation in an aspect suitable to our poor capacities. For the clause, "by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>)," comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." St. Peter may be referring to the formula, "And God said," so constantly repeated in the account of the creation, or (what is really the same truth) to the fact that "all things were made by him [by God the Word], and without him was not anything made that was made." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-6.htm">2 Peter 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</span> The Greek for" whereby" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things." The plural here presents some difficulty. The most obvious antecedents are "the heavens and the earth" of the last verse; but many commentators refer the relative to the twice-repeated  "water." The meaning will be the same whichever view we take. "The fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened;" that is, the Deluge was brought to pass by means of the heavens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the waters that were above the firmament, and the earth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the waters that were below the firmament, which came from the earth as the waters first mentioned came from the heavens. Another possible view is that of Huther, who refers <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to the water and the Word of God. By the world here must be meant the world of living creatures. This is St. Peter's answer to the mockers: there had been one great catastrophe; there will be another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the heavens and the earth, which are now;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the heavens which are now, and the earth.</span> The "now" does not refer, as some think, to any change wrought by the Flood, but distinguishes the present heavens and earth from the new heavens and new earth, which Christians are to look for (verse 13). By the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire. Several of the better manuscripts have "by his Word," which, on the whole, seems to give the best meaning. The reading in the text may, indeed, be understood in a similar sense, "by the same Word of God;" otherwise it would mean that the original word of creation determined also the duration of the world and the means of its destruction. The words rendered, "are kept in store," are, literally, "have been treasured (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>)" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>). It seems better to take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> ("with fire," or "for fire") with this verb rather than with the following, as in the Authorized Version. If we take the first meaning of the dative, the sense will be that the world has been stored <span class="accented">with</span> fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that it contains, stored up in its inner depths, the fire which is destined ultimately to destroy it. But the other view seems on the whole more probable; the heavens and the earth are stored up <span class="accented">for</span> fire or unto fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with the purpose in the counsels of God of their ultimate destruction by fire. This is the clearest prophecy in Holy Scripture of the final conflagration of the universe; but comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>.

Bengel finely says, "Dei aeoniologium (sic appellare liceat) differt ab horologic mortalium. Illius gnomon omnes homis simul indicat in summa actione et in summa quiete. Ei nec tardius nec celerius labuntur tempera quam ipsi et oeconomiae ejus aptum sit. Nulls causa est cur finem rerum aut protelare aut accelerare necessum habeat. Qui hoc comprehendemus? Si comprehendere possemus, non opus foret a Mose et Petro addi, apud Dominum." God is eternal: his thought is not, like ours, subject to the law of time; and even we can understand that one day, as the day of the Saviour's death, may have far more of intense action compressed into it, and far more influence upon the spiritual destiny of mankind, than any period of a thousand years. This passage seems to be quoted by Justin Martyr, the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' Irenaeus, and Hippolytus; but they may be referring to <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, though the quotations resemble the words of St. Peter more closely than those of the psalm.

This is a possible connection, but, not so satisfactory as the ordinary rendering. (For the genitive with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, see Winer, 3:30, 6, b.) The latter clause may be understood, "as some think it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the delay of the judgment, to be slackness;" or better, perhaps, "as some understand the meaning of slackness." Men are slow in fulfilling their promises from various, often selfish, motives; the Lord's delay comes from love and long-suffering. But is long-suffering to us-ward; rather, to <span class="accented">you-ward</span>, which seems to be the best-supported reading; two ancient manuscripts give "for your sake." St. Peter has the same thought in the First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4.htm">1 Peter 4</a>:20); there he reminds us how the long-suffering of God waited while the ark was a-preparing; here he tells us that the delay of the judgment, at which unbelievers scoff, is due to the same cause. We note here an item of evidence for the common authorship of the two Epistles (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, quoted in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>, and Ecclus. 32:22, in the Septuagint; also Augustine's well-known words, "Pattens quid aeternus"). <span class="cmt_word">Not willing that any should perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not wishing or desiring</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The participle gives the reason of the Lord's  delay; he hath no pleasure that the wicked should die (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23, 32</a>, and Ezekiel 33:11). <span class="cmt_word">But that all should come to repentance.</span> The G reek word for "come" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17</a> (see also the remarkable parallel from Plutarch, 'De Flum.,' page 19 (quoted by Alford), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Calvin takes it transitively, "willing to <span class="accented">receive</span> all to repentance." But the common translation is plainly right (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a> combined with <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a></div><div class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the day of the Lord will come.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, will come, stands emphatically at the beginning of the clause; whatever the mockers may say, whatever may happen, come certainly will the day of the Lord. "The day of the Lord" meets us often in the prophets; it is usually associated with the thought of judgment (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>). In the New Testament it signifies the second advent of Christ (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a thief in the night.</span> The best manuscripts omit here "in the night." St. Peter is evidently echoing the Lord's words in that great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives, which must have made such a deep impression upon the apostles. This illustration of the sudden coming of the thief is repeated not only by St. Peter here, but also by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>), and twice by St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a> and Revelation 16:15). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</span> The Greek for "with a great noise (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and is one of those remarkable poetic forms which are not unfrequent in this Epistle: the noun <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the whizzing of arrows, of the rush of wings, of the sound of mighty winds or roaring waters. It may be understood here of the crash of a falling world or of the roar of the destroying flames. The word rendered "pass away" is that used by our Lord in the prophecy just referred to (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; also in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> and in <a href="../../par/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> It is uncertain whether by "the elements" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) St. Peter means the four elements (in the old and popular use of the word), or the great constituent parts of the universe, the heavenly bodies. Against the first view is the assertion that one of those elements is to be the agent of destruction. But the word rendered "melt" means "shall be dissolved" or "loosed;" and it may be, as Bishop Wordsworth says, that "St. Peter's meaning seems to be that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, elements or rudiments, of which the universe is composed and compacted, will be loosed; that is, the framework of the world will be disorganized; and this is the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in the LXX. (Wisd. 7:17 Wisd. 19:17) and in Hippolytus, 'Philos.,' pages 219, 318. The dissolution is contrasted with the consistency described by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in verse 5. The heavens are reserved for fire, and will pass away with a rushing noise, and, being set on fire, will be dissolved; the elements will be on fire and melt, and he reduced to a state of confusion; the earth and the works therein will be burnt up. There does not seem, therefore, to be any cause for abandoning the common meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, the elemental principles of which the universe is made." On the other hand, the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly used of the heavenly bodies by Justin Martyr ('Apolog.,' 2. c. 5, and 'Dial. cum Tryphon,' c. 23); and the heavenly bodies are constantly mentioned in the descriptions of the awful convulsions of the great day (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, etc.). The objection that the word does not bear this meaning elsewhere in Holy Scripture is of little weight, as this is the only place in which it has a physical sense. The literal translation of the clause is, "The elements, being scorched, shall be dissolved." The word for "being scorched" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only here and in verse 12; it is used by the Greek physicians of the burning heat of fever. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "shall be dissolved or loosened." <span class="cmt_word">The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span> By "the works that are therein" St. Peter seems to mean all the works both of God and of man, "opera naturae et artis" (Bengel). There is a very remarkable reading here (supported by the Sinaitic and Vatican and another uncial manuscript), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be discovered," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be burned up." If we understand "the works that are therein" of man's works and actions, this reading will give a good sense (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, "Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is"). Or the clause may be regarded as interrogative, "Shall the earth and the works that are therein be found?" But the reading, "shall be burned up" is well supported, and suits the context best.

Some of the  better manuscripts read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, then, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, thus: "seeing that all these things are thus being dissolved." <span class="cmt_word">What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?</span> The Greek word for "what manner of persons" means literally, "of what country;" it seems to point to the great truth that God's people are fellow-citizens of the saints, that the commonwealth of which they are citizens is in heaven. The word for "to be" is the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which denotes original, essential, continuous being. (On the word for "conversation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, behaviour, conduct), see note on 1 Peter 1:15.) Both this noun and the following are plural in the Greek, and therefore mean "in all aspects and forms of holy conduct and godliness." Some commentators connect these last words, "in all holy conversation and godliness," with the next verse: "looking in all holy conversation," etc. Some, again, understand this verse as asking a question, which is answered in the next; but the Greek word for "what manner of persons" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) seems to be used in the New Testament as an exclamation only, not interrogatively. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.</span> The preposition "unto" is inserted without authority.

In the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> represents the "hasting righteousness" of our translation (comp. Pindar, 'Isthm.,' 5:22, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> means "to pursue virtue"). Here the translation "hastening" is most appropriate. The Father hath put the times and seasons in his own power; but as the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, so now he is "long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish;" and in his gracious mercy waits for the repentance of his chosen. St. Peter seems to represent Christians as "hastening the coming [literally, 'presence'] of the day of God" by working out their own salvation, and helping to spread the knowledge of the gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>), and so rendering the long-suffering patience of God no longer necessary. The words imply also the duty of praying for that coming, as we do in the second petition of the Lord's Prayer, and in the Funeral Service, "Beseeching thee, that it may please thee, of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom." Compare St. Peter's speech in <a href="../../par/acts/3.htm">Acts 3</a>, where he says, "Repent ye therefore...  that so (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>) there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ" (verses 19, 20, Revised Version). This remarkable coincidence of thought furnishes an argument of considerable weight in favour of the genuineness of this Epistle. Another possible rendering of the word is "earnestly desiring," which is adopted in the text of the Revised Version, and is preferred by some commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved.</span> The Greek for "wherein" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span>,' <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bd;</span>, on account of which, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on account of the day of God, or, what comes to much the same meaning, on account of the coming, the presence, of that day. Old things must pass away because of the coming of the day of God; the old order must give place to new. <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> The apostle repeats the striking words which he had already used in verse 10, with a different verb. The Greek word for "shall melt" here is not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in verse 10, but a stronger word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, are being melted, or wasted away. The tense is the prophetic present, implying a certain fulfillment. There is probably a reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, where the Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

St. John saw in vision the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah and St. Peter: "The first heaven and the first earth were passed away." It may be that, as the water of the Deluge was the baptism of the ancient world into a new life, so the fire of the great day will be the means of purifying and refining the universe, transforming it into new heavens and a new earth, making all things new. Our Lord's use of the word "regeneration," in <a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, seems to favour this view. In the regeneration of the individual soul the personality remains, the thoughts, desires, affections, are changed; so, it may be, in the regeneration of the world the substance will remain, the fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the old world will pass away (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>). But it is impossible to pronounce dogmatically whether the new heavens and earth will be a reproduction of the old in a far more glorious form, through the agency of the refining fire, or an absolutely new creation, as the words of Isaiah seem to imply. St. John, like St. Peter, speaks of a new earth, and tells us that that new earth will be the dwelling-place of the blessed. He saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven; the throne of God and of the Lamb (he tells us) shall be in it: "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them." The holy city, Jerusalem, which is above, is  in heaven now; the commonwealth of which the saints are citizens is in heaven (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). But heaven will come down to earth; the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be there; there his servants shall serve him. The distinction between earth and heaven will be abolished; for where God is, there is heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein dwelleth righteousness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, "Thy people shall be all righteous;" also Isaiah lay. 25; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>).

Christians who look for the coming of Christ must earnestly strive to imitate their Lord, the "Lamb without blemish and without spot." In the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "without spot," we have a link with <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. The word for "blameless" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is found elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>. The dative <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> should be rendered, not "of him" or "by him," but "in his sight" or "before him."

"In peace" was a common inscription on Christian graves.

Scoffers count the delay of the judgment slackness; the Christian should count it salvation; it is for the salvation of the elect that the judgment tarrieth. It is almost certain that by "our Lord" here St. Peter means the Lord Jesus, whom he describes by the same title in verse 18. Even as our beloved brother Paul also. The plural pronoun may be intended to imply that St. Paul was known to the Churches to which St. Peter was writing, and was beloved there. St. Peter addresses his readers as "beloved" four times in this Epistle; he here uses the same epithet of St. Paul. It comes naturally from his lips; but a writer of the second century would probably have used much stronger words of praise in speaking of one so much reverenced. According to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; rather, <span class="accented">wrote to you</span> (comp. Polycarp, 'Ad Philipp.,' 1:3, "One like me cannot equal the wisdom of the blessed Paul"). That wisdom was given mite him, as he himself says (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). If we ask to what Epistles of St. Paul is St. Peter referring, the passage which at once occurs to us is <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a> and 5. This Epistle was probably known to St. Peter; there may be a reference to <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> in verse 10 of this chapter; and Silvanus, whose name St. Paul associates with his own in both Epistles to the Thessalonians, was with St. Peter when he wrote his First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). But St. Peter's Second Epistle is addressed (primarily at least) to the same Churches to which the first was written (chapter 3:1). We must therefore either say, with Dean Alford, that "our Epistle belongs to a date when the Pauline Epistles were no longer the property only of the Churches to which they were written, but were dispersed through, and considered to belong to, the whole Christian Church;" or we must suppose that the passages in St. Peter's thoughts were not in the Epistle to the Thessalonians, but in some of the Epistles addressed to the Churches of Asia Minor; as, for instance, <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; or, possibly <a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> and Romans 9:22, as there seem to be some reasons for believing that this last Epistle was addressed to the Church at Ephesus among others.

The first reading would refer to the words immediately preceding - "these things;" "among the subjects on which St. Paul wrote there are some things," etc. The second would refer to "all his Epistles," and would mean that there are certain difficulties in St. Paul's Epistles generally. St. Peter does not tell us what difficulties were in his thoughts - whether St. Paul's teaching about "the man of sin," and "the day of the Lord," or his doctrine of justification by faith, and his assertion of Christian liberty, which might be perverted into anti-nomianism by such men as the false teachers censured in chapter 2. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "hard to be understood," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the ignorant and unsteadfast.</span> Both words are peculiar to this Epistle; the last occurs also in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>, the first here only in the New Testament. The verb also translated "wrest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only  here; it means "to twist with a windlass," and so "to strain, to torture, to distort." <span class="cmt_word">As they do also the other Scriptures.</span> This passage is of the greatest interest, as showing that some of St. Paul's Epistles had by this time taken their place in the estimate of Christians by the side of the sacred books of the Old Testament, and were regarded as Holy Scripture. By "the other Scriptures" St. Peter means the Old Testament, and also, perhaps, some of the earlier writings of the New, as the first three Gospels and the Epistle of St. James. St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, quotes a passage which seems to come from <a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> as Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their own destruction;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their own destruction of themselves.</span> The use of both adjective and pronoun intensifies the meaning (comp. chapter 2 Peter 2:1, 12). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <i>these things</i> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing that ye know these things before.</span> The pronoun "ye" is emphatic; others have gone astray; "continue ye faithful." The construction is participial, and there is no expressed object; literally, "knowing before," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that false teachers will arise. Beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">lest, being carried away</span>...  <span class="accented">ye fall.</span> It is interesting to notice that the word rendered "led or carried away" is used by St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>, of St. Barnabas, who, along with St. Peter himself, was then "carried away" with the dissimulation of the Judaizers. The word rendered "wicked," rather "lawless," is used elsewhere in the New Testament only in chapter 2 Peter 2:7. The word for "steadfastness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">But grow in grace, and <i>in</i> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <i>be</i> glory both now and for ever. Amen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> Growth is necessary for steadfastness; we cannot persevere unless we continually advance in faith (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5-7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>). Some, as Alford, take the genitive with "grace" as well as with "knowledge;" but this connection forces us to regard it first as subjective, then as objective - the grace which Christ gives, and the knowledge of which he is the Object - and so seems somewhat forced. St. Peter insists on the knowledge of Christ as essential for growth in grace, at the beginning, as at the end, of this Epistle. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. We notice the doxology addressed to Christ; it reminds us of the hymn which Pliny, in his famous letter to Trajan, says the Christians of Bithynia (one of the provinces mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>) were wont to address to Christ as to God. To him be (or is) the glory - all the glory which belongs to God, which we ascribe to him. "For ever" is, literally, "for the day of the age or of eternity (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." This remarkable expression is found only here, and is variously interpreted. Bengel explains it as, "dies sine nocte, morus et perpetuus;" Huther as, "the day on which eternity begins as contrasted with time, but which day is likewise all eternity itself." Fronmuller quotes St. Augustine: "It is only one day, but an everlasting day, without yesterday to precede it, and without tomorrow to follow it; not brought forth by the natural sun, which shall exist no more, but by Christ, the Sun of Righteousness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_peter/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Peter 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Peter 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_john/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 John 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 John 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
