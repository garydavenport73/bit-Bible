The following clause is a repetition of <a href="../../par/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; and Amos thus connects his prophecy with that of his predscessor, to show the unity of prophetic mission, and to warn the Jews that God's punishments are not directed exclusively on heathen nations. To the nations denounced by Joel, Amos adds others of Israel's enemies, viz. Syria, Ammon, and Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Roar...  voice.</span> The thunder is the voice of God announcing his coming to judge. <span class="cmt_word">From Zion.</span> Not from Dan and Bethel, the seats of idolatrous worship, but from Jerusalem, the abode of his presence. <span class="cmt_word">The habitations;</span> better, <span class="accented">the pastures.</span> It is only natural that Amos, the shepherd, should use such terms to express the idea that the whole land, from Jerusalem on the south to Carmel on the north, should feel the vengeance of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Shall mourn;</span> explained by the following term, <span class="cmt_word">shall wither;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall lose their verdure (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The top of Carmel.</span> This is the Mount Carmel, which stretches boldly into the sea on the south of the Bay of Acre, and is remarkable for its extreme fertility, its rich pastures, its vines, olives, fruits, and flowers. Thomson, 'The Land and the Book;' writes thus about it: "The celebrated ridge, called in the Bible Merest Carmel, and by the Arabs Jebel Kurmul, or Mar Elyas, in honour of Elijah, is an extension of the hills of Samaria, in a northwesterly direction, for a distance of about eighteen miles, terminating in the bold promontory of Carmel, which descends almost literally into the sea. It is steep and lofty where it overhangs the Mediterranean above Haifa,  and on that face which overlooks the Plain of Acre on the north, and that of Esdraelon towards the southeast. There is no special excellency in Carmel at the present day, whatever may be said of Sharon. Its name, Kurmul, or Kerm-el, signifies 'the vineyard of God;' but its vineyards have all disappeared. It was a glorious mountain, however, and a prominent landmark; according to Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>), Carmel was a resort of herdsmen. Amos says, 'The habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither,' in the time of the threatened judgment, and this implies that its pastures were not ordinarily liable to wither. This may, in part, have been occasioned by the heavy dews which its lofty elevation, so near the sea, causes to distil nightly upon its thirsty head. I found it quite green and flowery in midsummer. It was a noble pasture field, and, in reference to that characteristic, Micah utters his sweet prayer, 'Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - Before announcing the judgment on Israel, Amos proclaims the punishment on neighbouring heathen nations for their injurious treatment of the chosen people, thus showing God's care for his elect, and leading them to fear vengeance for their own greater sins towards him. The order observed in denouncing these nations is not geographical, but is regulated by the nature of each people's relation to Israel, and the degree in which they have sinned against her. The denunciation begins with Syria, her hitherto most oppressive enemy, and the least akin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four.</span> This form of expression is repeated in each of the following strophes, and some critics have taken the terms literally, and have tried to identify that particular number of transgressions in each case; but this is trifling. The phrase and others similar to it are not uncommon, and are used to signify a great number, the last mentioned being supposed to fill up the measure and make it overflow. Thus <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>, "He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15, 18, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). So Hom., 'Od.,' 5:306, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span>: and Virg., 'AEn.,' 1:94, "O terque quaterque beati;" comp. Hor., 'Carm,' 1:31, 13. <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span> had been an active enemy of Israel since the time that Rezon threw off his allegiance (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>, etc.), and seized Damascus, which had been tributary to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-5.htm">2 Samuel 8:5</a>). The history of the wars carried on by Syria against the Jews may be read in the sacred books (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>, etc.; 2 Kings 10:32, etc.; 2 Kings 12:18; 13:5, 25; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will not turn away the punishment thereof.</span> So in the following strophes. Literally, <span class="accented">I will not reverse it.</span> Amos does not expressly say <span class="accented">what</span>; but he means the sentence or judgment (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>, "I cannot reverse it," where the same word is used). The Latin Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Non convertam eum</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">Damascum</span>, which Knabenbauer explains, "I will not avert its destruction, will not turn it aside from its downward course." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "I will not turn away from it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as explained by Theodoret, "I will no longer disregard its sins." <span class="cmt_word">Because they have threshed Gilead</span>. This is the culminating offence of the Syrians. The word rendered "threshing instrument" (<span class="accented">charutz</span>) signifies a kind of corn drag made of heavy planks fastened together and armed beneath with sharp stones or iron points. This machine, weighted with the driver who sat or stood upon it, was drawn by oxen over the corn (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>). A representation of it is given by Smith, 'Dict. of Bible,' 1:31, and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' 1:86. Such an instrument, set with sharp flints in rows, was to be seen in the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of the year 1886, in the Cyprus department. Another kind of instrmuent (<span class="accented">moreg</span>) is thus described by Jerome: "Est autem genus plaustri, quod rotis subter ferreis atque dentatis volvitur, ut excussis frumentis stipulam in areis conterat, et in cibos jumentorum propter foeni sterilitatem paleas comminuat." Such an implement was used in the infliction of capital punishment by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>). <span class="accented">Gilead</span> is here put for all the country east of Jordan (<a href="../../par/joshua/22-9.htm">Joshua 22:9</a>). The cruel treatment referred to in the text occurred in the time of Hazael during the reign of Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>, etc.; comp. 13:7). The Septuagint has, "Because with iron saws they sawed asunder women with child." This is doubtless a reminiscence of Elisha's words to Hazael (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fire</span>. Material fire, though elsewhere the term is used metaphorically for war and its evils (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-63.htm">Psalm 78:63</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). This passage of Amos, combined with ver. 14, is quoted by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:27), where he is pronouncing the doom of Damascus. <span class="cmt_word">House of Hazael...  palaces of Benhadad.</span> The  two expressions are parallel, or they may signify the family of Hazael, and Damascus itself with its magnificent royal palaces. There were three kings of Syria named Benhadad. The first of the name made alliance with Asa, and fought successfully against Baasha (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>); Benhadad II. was the contemporary of Ahab, and carded on war for many years with the northern kingdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>). He was murdered either by Hazael or his servants (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-15.htm">2 Kings 8:15</a>). Benhadad III., the son of Hazael, was a monarch of small ability, and Syria under his sway sank into insignificance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a>, etc.; 2 Kings 14:27; 15:17). All this happened before the time of Amos, who probably refers to all the kings of that name, Benhadad, "Son of the Sun," being the title of the dynasty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bar</span> which secured the gate of the city (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>). Breaking the bar is equivalent to laying the place open to the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">From the plain of Avon;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">de campo idoli</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">bikath-Aven</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;</span>; better, <span class="accented">from the valley of Aven</span>, or <span class="accented">vanity</span>, perhaps so called analogously with Hosea's naming <span class="accented">Bethel, Bethaven</span>, "House of God" and "House of vanity" (<a href="../../par/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>). Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 677) and Pusey refer the name to a valley between Lebanon and Antilibanus, a continuation of the Arabah, still called <span class="accented">Bukaa</span>, in the middle of which stood Baalbec, "the Temple of the sun of the valley," called Heliopolis by Greek and Roman writers (see 'Classical Museum,' 3:136). The LXX. Renders "On" in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a> by "Heliopolis;" and On and Baal being both titles of the sun, and indeed synonymous, the introduction of "On" into this passage may be accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">Him that holdeth the sceptre.</span> The king and princes, as ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">From the house of Eden;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-Eden</span>, "House of delight;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">de domo voluptatis</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "out of the men of Charran." This last rendering arises from considering that the reference was to the Eden of <a href="../../par/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>, which the translators placed in the region of Haran. The place in the text Keil supposes to be the Paradisus of the Greeks, which Ptolemy (5:15, 20) locates southeast of Laodicea. Schrader suggests a place on the banks of the middle Euphrates between Balis and Biredschich called <span class="accented">Bit</span>-<span class="accented">Adini</span> in inscriptions of Asurnasirhabal and Salmanassur II. But this seems to be a wrong locality (see 'Die Keilinschriften,' p. 327). The passage means that all the inhabitants of valley and city, king and peasant, shall be cut off. Shall go into captivity. The word implies that the land shall be "stripped" or "bared" of its inhabitants. Wholesale deportation had not hitherto been common in these regions. Kir has been identified with the country on the banks of the river Kar, which flows into the Araxes on the southwest of the Caspian Sea. It forms part of the territory known as Transcaucasia. From this region the Syrians originally emigrated (<a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), and back to this land a large body were carried when Tiglath-Pileser, some fifty years later, killed Rezin and sacked Damascus, as related in <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> This is the solemn confirmation of the prophet's announcement, and recurs in vers. 8, 15 and <a href="../../par/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>.

Gaza, modern <span class="accented">Guzzeh</span>, was the most southern city of Philistia in the immediate neighbourhood of the desert. (For a description of the Plain of Philistia, see Sir C. Warren, 'Survey Memoirs,' volume on Jerusalem, p. 436.) <span class="cmt_word">The whole captivity;</span> Hebrew, "an entire captivity," the whole people, so that neither age nor sex was spared.

Probably they punctuated the word translated "perfect" (<span class="accented">shelemah</span>) <span class="accented">shelomoh</span>, making "Solomon" stand for his people Israel. Cyril supposes that the reference is to cities which Solomon established among neighbouring nations; these had now been destroyed or seized. The event referred to may be the invasion of Judah by Philistines and Arabians in the time of Joram, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, etc., and in which it is possible that a compact was made that the captive Judaeans should be delivered to their bitterest enemies, the Edomites. One would rather have expected a reference to some evil inflicted on Israel (as in ver. 3) instead of an injury done to Judah.

"Askelon differs from the other celebrated cities of the Philistines, being seated on the sea, while Ekron, Garb, Jamnia, Ashdod, and Gaza are in the interior. It never could have had a harbour of any considerable size, however.... The topography of the place is peculiar. An abrupt ridge begins near the shore, runs up eastward, bends round to the south, then to the west, and finally northwest to the sea again, forming an irregular amphitheatre. On the top of this ridge ran the wall, which was defended at its salient angles by strong towers. The specimens which still exist show that it was very high and thick, built, however, of small stones, and bound together by broken columns of granite and marble. This clearly proves that it is patchwork, and not Askelon's original rampart.... The position is one of the fairest along this part of the Mediterranean coast; and when the interior of the amphitheatre was adorned with splendid temples and palaces, ascending, rank above rank, from the shore to the summit, the appearance from the sea must have been very imposing. Now the whole area is planted over with orchards of the various kinds of fruit which flourish in this region" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' <span class="accented">Southern Palestine</span>, p. 171). In spite of its bad harbour, it carried on a lucrative foreign commerce, which was the chief cause of its power and importance (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' 1:247, Eng. transl.). It was about fifty Roman miles from Jerusalem. In mediaeval times there were two cities of the name, one on the coast (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>), the same as Herod's Ascalon, and one inland.

Sennacherib, in a cuneiform inscription, records how he treated the two other cities: "Zedekiah King of Ashkelon," he says, "who had not submitted himself to my yoke, himself, the gods of the house of his fathers, his wife, his sons, his daughters, and his brothers, the seed of the house of his fathers, I removed, and I sent him to Assyria. I set over the men of Ashkelon, Sarludari, the son of Rukipti, their former king, and I imposed upon him the payment of tribute, and the homage due to my majesty, and he became a vassal....  I marched against the city of Ekron, and put to death the priests and the chief men who had committed the sin (of rebellion), and I hung up their bodies on stakes all round the city. The citizens who had done wrong and wickedness I counted as a spoil" (Professor Sayce, 'Fresh Light from the Monuments,' pp. 120, 121). <span class="cmt_word">I will turn mine hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">will bring back my hand</span>; visit again with punishment, or repeat the blow (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; see note on Zechariah 13:7). <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> All the Philistines who had as yet escaped destruction (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>).

From the time of Esau until now they had been consistent in enmity, and it is this unbrotherly conduct rather than any specific outrages which Amos here condemns. Edom is accused of relentless persecution, inhumanity, savage fury, and persistent anger.

Both Jerome and Eusebius ('Onomast.') speak of a city so called not far from Petra; but in the Old Testament the name is applied to a district; and as the word in Hebrew means "south," it is probably the southern portion of the land of Edom. <span class="cmt_word">Bozrah</span> (<span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Busaireh</span>) was the old capital of Edom, situated on a hill south of the Dead Sea (see <a href="../../par/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>). Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>) predicts the punishment of Edom, and Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>) does likewise.

The Ammonites seem to have been a predatory and roving nation, though the abundance of rains in the district shows that they possessed fixed abodes; but Rabbah was the only city of importance in their territory (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>). Their hostility to Israel was first shown in their participation with Moab in the affair of Balsam (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). Other instances are seen in their treatment of Jabesh-Gilead (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-3</a>) and of David's messengers, and in hiring the Syrians to make war on David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-6</a>). We have no historical account of the atrocious outrage on the Gileadites mentioned in the text, but it is quite in character with the ferocity of their disposition, and was doubtless intended to depopulate the territory which they wished to acquire. This barbarity is spoken of in connection with Hazael (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>), in concert with whom probably the Ammonites acted (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>). Another rendering would refer the clause to the removing of landmarks, and yet a third to the storming of lofty fortresses. But the Authorized Version is undoubtedly correct. That they might enlarge their border. The Ammonites laid claim to the territory which the Israelites had wrested from Sihon, lying between the Araon and Jabbok, and made an attempt upon it in the time of Jephthah (<a href="../../par/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>.), and in later years seized on the possessions of Gad - a proceeding which brought upon them the denunciation of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rabbah</span>, "the Great," or <span class="accented">Rabbath-Ammon</span>, the capital of Ammon, was situated on the southern arm of the Jabbok, and was a place of remarkable strength (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). "For picturesqueness of situation, I know of no ruins to compare with Ammon. The most striking feature is the citadel, which formerly contained not merely the garrison, but an upper town, and covered an extensive area. The lofty plateau on which it was situated is triangular in shape; two sides are formed by the valleys which diverge from the apex, where they are divided by a low neck, and thence separating, fall into the valley of the Jabbok, which forms the base of the triangle, and contained the lower town. Climbing up the citadel, we can trace the remains of the moat, and, crossing it, find ourselves in a maze of ruins. The massive walls - the lower parts of which still remain, and which, rising from the precipitous sides of the cliff, rendered any attempt at scaling impossible - were evidently Ammonite. As I leant over them and looked sheer down about three hundred feet into one wady, and four hundred feet into the other, I did not wonder at its having occurred to King David that the leader of a forlorn hope against these ramparts would meet with certain death, and consequently assigning the position to Uriah....  Joab afterwards took the lower city, which he called 'the city of waters,' indicating very probably that the Jabbok was dammed into a lake near the lower city, to which the conformation of the valley would lend itself" (Oliphant, 'Land of Gilead,' p. 259, etc.). There is a sketch of the citadel hill in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:985. The city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2, 3</a>), either at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, or in the course of his Egyptian campaign (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 10:09. 7). The expression, <span class="cmt_word">I will kindle a fire</span> (not "send," as elsewhere), possibly implies, as Pusey suggests, a conflagration from within. <span class="cmt_word">The shouting</span>  is the battle cry of the opposing host, which adds to the horror of the scene (<a href="../../par/job/39-25.htm">Job 39:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With a tempest.</span> The idea is that the walls should fall before the invaders, as if they were teats swept away in a whirlwind.

So Keil, Trochon, and others consider that the King of the Ammonites is meant. The Vulgate, with Aquila, Symmachus, the Syriac, and Jerome, retrains the word Melchous, or Melcham, which is the same as Molech, their god. This interpretation is favoured by passages in Jeremiah, of which one is evidently quoted from Amos, "For Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>); and the other (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>) is similar, with the substitution of "Chemosh," the god of Moab, for "Maleam." That the localized deity should share the fortunes of his worshippers is quite in accordance with the ideas of the time (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>). Probably Amos meant to include both notions - their "Malcam," whether king or god. should be carried into captivity, accompanied by the princes, all the chiefs, military and sacerdotal, so that no one should he left to head a future revolt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joel/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joel 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joel 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../amos/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Amos 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Amos 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/amos/2.htm"><title>Amos 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/amos/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/amos/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/amos/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../amos/1.htm" title="Amos 1">&#9668;</a> Amos 2 <a href="../amos/3.htm" title="Amos 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Judgment on Moab. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab</span>. The prophet now denounces the other nation connected by ties of blood with Israel (see on Amos 1:13). Moab's hostility had been shown in the hiring of Balsam to curse the Israelites, and in seducing them to idolatry (<a href="../../par/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-25:3</a>). He was their oppressor in the time of the Judges (<a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>); and David had to take most stringent measures against him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Moabites joined in a league against Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>), and later against Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and, as we see by the inscription on the Moabite Stone, were always ready to profit by the disasters or weakness of the chosen people. "I erected this stone," says Mesha, "to Chemosh at Kirkha, a stone of salvation, for he saved me from all despoilers, and made me see my desire upon all mine enemies, even upon Omri, King of Israel." And then he goes on to recount his victories. <span class="cmt_word">He burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</span> This profanation of the corpse of the King of Edom (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1, 2</a>) is not mentioned in the historical books. Some of the older commentators, as Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide, think that the prophet wishes to show that the sympathy of God extends beyond the covenant people, and that he punishes wrongs inflicted even on heathen nations. But as in the case of the other nations, Amos reproves only crimes committed against Israel or Judah, so the present outrage must have the same connection. The reference to the King of Moab's sacrifice of "his eldest son," even if we suppose (which is improbable) the son of the King of Edom to be meant, is plainly inapplicable (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), as the offence regarded the king himself, and not his son, and the expression, "burned into lime," can hardly be thought to refer to a human sacrifice. The act mentioned probably occurred during the time that the Edomites joined Jehoram and Jehoshaphat in the league against Mesha, the King of Moab (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 9</a>), the author of the inscription on the celebrated stone erected by him at Dibon. Unfortunately, the last lines of that inscription, describing the war against the Edomites, are lost. The paragraph that remains is this: "And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Edom], and take...  Chemosh...  in my days. Wherefore I made...  year ... and I..." The Jewish tradition, quoted by Jerome, tells that after this war the Moabites, in revenge for the assistance which the King of Edom had given to the Israelites, dug up and dishonoured his bones. Edom was then in vassalage to Israel, but regained its independence some ten years  later (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). The sacrilegious act was meant to redound to the disgrace of Israel

The obscure expression in the text is capable of two explanations. Hitzig, Pusey, Trochon, assume that its meaning is that in their avarice and cupidity the usurers or tyrannous rich men grudge even the dust which the poor man strews upon his head in token of his sorrow at being brought to so low a state. But this seems unnatural and farfetched, and scarcely in harmony with the simple style of Amos. The other explanation, supported by Kimchi, Sehegg, Keil, and Knabenbauer, is preferable. These oppressors desire eagerly to see the poor crushed to the earth, or so miserable as to scatter dust on their heads (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>). <span class="accented">The poor</span> (<span class="accented">dal</span>, not the same word as in ver. 6); <span class="accented">depressed</span>, as brought low in condition. The Septuagint joins this with the previous clause, "And the poor for sandals, the things that tread on the dust of the earth, and smote on the heads of the needy." The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Qui conterunt super pulverem terrae capita pauperum</span>, "Who bruise the heads of the poor on the dust of the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Turn aside the way of the meek.</span> They thwart and hinder their path of life, and force them into crooked and evil ways. Or <span class="accented">way</span>, according to Kimchi, may mean "judicial process," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. This gives, to the clause much the same meaning as ver. 6. <span class="accented">The meek</span> are those who are lowly and unassuming (see note on Zephaniah 2:3). <span class="cmt_word">And a man</span>  <span class="cmt_word">and his father will go in unto the same maid;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate, which omits "the same," is closer to the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Et filius ac pater ejus ierunt ad puellam</span>, though the Greek doubtless gives the intended meaning. This sin, which was tantamount to incest, was virtually forbidden (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>).

Such crimes dishonoured the God who called them his people, so that to them could be applied what St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>), "The Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20, 23</a>).

These do, not coincide by mere chance, no more than two persons pursue in company the same end without previous agreement. The prophet announces God's judgment because God has commissioned him; the prophet is of one mind with God, therefore the Lord is with him, and confirms his words. The application of the parables is seen in vers. 7, 8. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "except they know one another."

The lion roars when he has his pray in sight, and is about to spring upon it. So God makes the prophet utter his voice because he is ready to execute vengeance. The second clause expresses the same fact in different terms. The young lion (<span class="accented">kephir</span>) is not a whelp, but one able to provide for itself. He growls over the prey which he has in his lair. So Israel lies helpless as the words of God's threatenings strike upon him.

St. Gregory, moralizing, takes the lion in a spiritual sense: "After the power of his Creator has been made known to him, the strength of his adversary ought not to be concealed from him, in order that he might submit himself the more humbly to his defender, the more accurately he had learned the wickedness of his enemy, and might more ardently seek his Creator, the more terrible he found the enemy to be whom he had to avoid. For it is certain that he who less understands the danger he has escaped, loves his deliverer has; and that he who considers the strength of his adversary to be feeble, regards the solace of his defender as worthless" ('Moral.,' 32:14). Of course, this exposition does not regard the context.

God bids the prophets (<span class="cmt_word">publish ye</span>) summon the inhabitants of the palaces of Philistia (of which Ashdod is the representative) and Egypt, because they had been the chief enemies of his people, and in their sight had mighty works been wrought for Israel; thus they could appreciate her iniquity and ingratitude. Some, translating <span class="accented">al</span> "upon," say that the prophets are bidden publish their  message upon the flat roofs of the palaces, that it may be heard far and near (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>).

The illustration from a common incident in a shepherd's life is very natural in Amos. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh</span>; better, <span class="accented">rescueth</span>. So below, <span class="cmt_word">shall be taken out;</span> <span class="accented">shall be rescued</span>. The usual explanation is that a shepherd attacks the lion which has seized one of his sheep (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, etc.), and rescues from it the most worthless parts - "a couple of shank bones or a bit, or tip, of an ear." But as an attack on a lion would be an abnormal act of courage on the part of a shepherd, and the comparison is with things likely and usual, it is probable that the meaning is that the shepherd finds only these poor remnants after the lion has left his prey. So such a poor remnant shall be rescued from the ten tribes of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">That dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed;</span> that sit at ease, lounging in the cosiest corner of the divan, an image of indolent ease and careless security in the face of impending judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And in Damascus in a couch;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">et in Damasci grabato</span>. The Syriac and Jewish Versions agree in considering the word "Damascus" to be a proper name. The other modern rendering takes it to mean the material which we call "damask," or something similar. Hence our Revised Version gives, "on the silken cushions of a bed;" and others, "on the damask of a couch." Dr. Pusey retains the old rendering, on the grounds that there is no evidence to prove that the manufactures for which Damascus was celebrated in after time existed at this period, its exports being then wine and white wool (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), and that the Arabic word <span class="accented">dimakso</span> (which critics have cited as connected with the term "damask") has nothing to do with Damascus, and meant raw, not manufactured, "silk." He translates, "in Damascus, a couch," and explains this to mean that Damascus, which Jeroboam II had won for Israel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>), "was a canopied couch to them, in which they stayed themselves." This agrees with the ancient Jewish interpretation, which explains the clause to mean that the Israelites would some day depend for help on the Syrians represented by Damascus A third exposition, favoured by the Latin Vulgate, makes the words to mean, "on a couch of Damascus;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Syrian couch of a costly and luxurious nature. This comes to the same as the modern rendering given, above and seems to be the easiest explanation of the expression.

The Hebrew expression <span class="accented">haharmonah</span> occurs nowhere else. Our version takes it in the sense of <span class="accented">armon</span>, "a palace," intending probably a palace or citadel of the enemy, which certainly ought to have been expressed. Kimchi renders, "Ye shall cast yourselves into the palace of the king." The passage is probably corrupt. If the verb is taken as passive, the unusual word must be considered to denote the place of banishment. Thus, "Ye shall be cast forth into Harmon." Whether Harmon means Armenia, as many ancient commentators thought, or not, cannot be determined. Various opinions may be seen in Keil, Schegg, Trochon, and others; but the simplest explanation is that of Orelli and Ewald, viz. that each fugitive shall fling away her idol Rimmona (the wife of the god Rimmon, <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>), in order to be more free for flight (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>).

Gilgal was a strong position in the plain of Jordan, three miles east of Jericho, taking its name probably from the stone circles erected for purposes of worship in very early times. Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>) gave a new meaning to the old name. There is a large pool of water in this neighbourhood called Jil-julieh, about four miles from the Jordan, which is doubtless a corruption of the ancient name Gilgal. It seems to have been regarded as a holy place in Samuel's days or even before (see <a href="../../par/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 13:8, etc.);   and later was appropriated to false worship, though we have no information as to the date of this declension. Gilgal and Bethel are associated together in idolatrous worship (<a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and in <a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bring your sacrifices every morning.</span> They were careful to maintain the outward semblance of the regular Levitical worship, even beyond the letter of the Law in some respects, though their service was all the time idolatry. As this and the following clause are still ironical, Amos is speaking, not of the daily-prescribed sacrifice (<span class="accented">olah</span>, <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>), but of the offerings (<span class="accented">zebach</span>) of individual Israelites which were not required to be presented every day. <span class="cmt_word">Your tithes after three years;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">three of days</span>; <span class="accented">lishlosheth yamim</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">tribus diebus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "every third day." Revised Version, "every three days." So Gesenius, Ewald, Keil, Schegg, Hitzig, Baur. The prophet bids them bring their tithes, not as the Law ordered, every year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>), or, as in the case of the second tithe, every three years (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), but, by an ironical exaggeration, "every three days." Dr. Pusey defends the English Version on the ground of the idiomatic use of "days" for one circle of days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a>). But this loses the irony which is so marked in the whole passage. Keil, "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God."

The ironical charge to the Israelites is that in their unlicensed zeal they should not only burn on the altar that which was leavened, but, with the idea of being more bountiful, they should also offer by fire that which was to be set apart for other uses. The Septuagint Version can only be explained by considering the translators to have had a different reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "and they read the Law without." <span class="cmt_word">Proclaim...  publish.</span> Make public proclamation that free will offerings are to be made, or else, like the Pharisees (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>), announce with ostentation that you are about to offer.

(For an exhaustive catalogue of the earthquakes in this country, see Pusey's notes on this verse.) <span class="cmt_word">As God overthrew.</span> The substitution of the name of God for the personal pronoun, when the Lord himself is speaking, is not uncommon in Hebrew.

This verse has been explained in different ways. Hitzig, Keil, with many ancient commentators, find in it a threat of chastisement, "the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God." Pusey, Professor Gandell, and others consider it to be a call to amendment. "He bids them let judgment, which had hitherto been perverted in its course, roll on like a mighty tide of waters, sweeping before it all hindrances," filling the whole land with righteousness. Schegg makes it to be a promise of the coming of the day of the Lord, that is, the revelation of Messiah. But such a promise in this position is very forced and unnatural. The second interpretation seems most suitable. In the midst of the denunciation of men's formal worship, the prophet announces their duty in the present crisis, attention to which could alone win God's favour. Judgment and righteousness, long neglected and forgotten, should permeate the land like refreshing streams of water - a simile of special signification to an inhabitant of an Eastern country, where the neighbourhood of a perennial stream was as delightful as it was unusual. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty</span> (<span class="accented">ethan</span>); <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "impassable" (Septuagint); <span class="accented">fortis</span> (Vulgate). The word may mean "strong," or "perennial." "Whence the seventh month, just before the early rain, was called the month <span class="accented">Ethanim, i.e.</span> the month of <span class="accented">the perennial streams</span>, when they alone flowed" (Pusey).

It is certain, too, that during the sojourn in the wilderness sacrificial worship fell greatly into desuetude, as we know that the rite of circumcision was suspended (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5-7</a>), the Passover was not duly celebrated, and Joshua urged  the people to put away the strange gods from among them (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>). Moses, too, doubtless with a view to existing practices, warns them against worshipping the heavenly bodies (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), and offering sacrifice unto devils (<span class="accented">seirim</span>), "after whom they had gone a-whoring" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>).

But to argue (as some neologians do) from this passage of Amos that the Israelites during those forty years knew nothing of Jehovah, or that Amos himself denies that they offered him any worship, is absurd, seeing that the prophet presupposes the fact, and blames them for corrupting the Divine service and mingling the prescribed and enacted ritual with idolatrous accretions. <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifices</span>; slain, bloody sacrifices. <span class="cmt_word">Offerings</span>; bloodless sacrifices, meal offerings.

The connection with the context, the meaning of some of the terms, and whether the reference is to past, present, or future, are questions which have roused much controversy. We need not here recapitulate the various opinions which have been held. It will be sufficient to state what seems to be the simplest and most probable explanation of the passage. But we must not omit to mention first the explanation adopted by Ewald, Schrader, Farrar, Konig, and others, viz. that this verse refers to the punitive deportation which was to be the people's lot, when they should take their shrines and images with them into captivity. "So shall ye take (into exile) Sakkuth your king," etc. But the punishment is foretold in ver. 27; and this verse contrasts their idol worship with the neglected worship of Jehovah (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">But ye have borne;</span> <span class="accented">and ye bare</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">portastis</span> (Vulgate).

The Hebrew word rendered "tabernacle" (<span class="accented">sikkuth</span>). which is found nowhere else, has been variously explained. Aquila gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: Theodotion, "vision," reading the whole sentence thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Many moderns render, "stake," "column," or "shrine." Others suppose it to be equivalent to <span class="accented">Sakkuth</span>, an Assyrian name for Molech (or Adar); but this is very uncertain (see 'Studien und Kritiken.' 1874, p. 887), sad the parallelism requires the word to be an appellative and not a proper name. It most probably means "shrine," a portable shrine, like those spoken of in <a href="../../par/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a> in connection with the worship of Diana. The Syriac and Arabic versions call it "tent," and thus the reproach stands forth emphatically that, instead of, or in conjunction with, the true tabernacle, they bore aloft, as if proud of their apostasy, the tabernacle of a false god. Such shrines were used by the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2:63, where see Rawlinson's note) and Diod. Sic. (1:97). Many such may be seen in the Egyptian room of the British Museum. Keil quotes Drumann, 'On the Rosetta Inscription,' p. 211, "These were small chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways, intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be carried or driven about with it." Hence we must look to Egypt as the source of this idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Moloch</span>, though sanctioned by the LXX. and St. Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), is a mistranslation. De Rossi, indeed, mentions that one Hebrew manuscript gives <span class="accented">Moloch</span>, but the received reading is <span class="accented">Melkekem</span>, which is confirmed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Syriac. The translation, therefore, should run, "Ye took up the shrine of your king," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of him whom ye made your king in the place of Jehovah, meaning some stellar divinity. <span class="cmt_word">And Chiun your images;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fec;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "and the star of your god Raephan "(Septuagint); <span class="accented">et imaginem idolorum vestrorum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the kiyyun of your images.</span> The parallelism again requires us to take this unknown word as an appellative; and according to its probable derivation, its meaning is "pedestal," or "framework," that on which the image stood.

Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 215, etc.) considers Gath to be the same city as Betogabra, Eleutheropolis, and the modern <span class="accented">Beth Jibrin</span>, which is some few miles south of <span class="accented">Tell Safi</span>. He thinks the site of Tell Sift is not adapted for the seat of a large city, and he saw few indications of ancient ruins there; whereas Beit Jibrin has in and around it the most wonderful remains of antiquity to be found in all Philistia. It had probably declined in importance at this time (see note on ch. 1:6), but its old reputation was still remembered. It was taken by Uzziah, but seems not to have remained long in his possession (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>).

It is too late to call upon God now; it is the time of vengeance. We rejected him in life; we may not cry to him in death. St. Jerome refers the prohibition to the hardness of heart and unbelief of the people, who even in all this misery will not confess the name of the Lord. Keil says, "It indicates a fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, his eye should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death." Others again think that the notion in the mind of the impious speaker is that Jehovah is the Author of all their calamities, and that he is impatient at the very mention of his name. The simplest explanation is the first, or a modification of it The person addressed is about to pray or to call on God in his distress. "Be silent," says the speaker; "we can no longer appeal to Jehovah as the covenant God; by naming him we call to his remembrance how we have broken the covenant, violated our relation to him; therefore provoke him not further by making mention of his name."

But to interpret the expression entirely in a spiritual sense, with no substantial basis, as "Jehovah's judgments," destroys the harmony of the vision, ignoring its material aspect altogether. It is quite possible that the custom above mentioned did exist, though it was probably limited to certain lands, and did not apply to the whole pasturage of the country. It is here mentioned to define the time of the plague of locusts - the time, in fact, when its ravages would be most irremediable.

The particular calamity alluded to is the second invasion of Tigiath-Pileser II, when he conquered Gilead and the northern part of the kingdom, and carried some of the people captive to Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>).

As the word in other dialects means tin or lead, it is usually taken here to mean the plumb line which builders use to ascertain that their work is even and perpendiculur (see a very different explanation in Knabenbauer, p. 314, etc.). The "wall" is the kingdom of Israel, once carefully built up, solidly constructed, accurately arranged. God had made it upright; how was it now?

Jeroboam II. had roved Israel from Syria, and was popular owing to his success in war (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>); but his dynasty was overthrown, and this overthrow was the destruction of the Israelitish monarchy. The murder of his son Zachariah by Shallum (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>) led to those disastrous commotions which culminated in the conquest of Samaria by the Assyrians and the deportattion of the people.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">This bold prophecy, no longer conceived in general terms or referring to distant times, but distinct and personal, arouses the animosity of the priestly authorities at Bethel, who accuse Amos before the king, and warn him to leave the country without more words, or to fear the worst.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amaziah the priest of Bethel.</span> Amaziah ("the Lord is strong"), the chief of the idol priests at Bethel, a crafty and determined man, hearing this prophecy against the royal house, takes it up as a political matter, and makes a formal accusation against Amos with the view of silencing him. <span class="cmt_word">Hath conspired against thee.</span> Probably some of the Israelites had been convinced by the prophet's words, and had joined themselves to him; hence Amaziah speaks of "a conspiracy" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>) against the king. Or very possibly the story was fabricated in order to accentuate the charge against Amos. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the house of Israel.</span> In the very centre of the kingdom, where his treasonable speeches would have the greatest effect. The land, personified, cannot endure such language, which is calculated to disturb its peace, and is quite contrary to its ideas and hopes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/7-11.htm">Amos 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - This is a partly correct account of what the prophet had said, but it differed in some important particulars. Amaziah carefully omits the fact that Amos had merely been the mouthpiece of God in all his announcements; he says falsely that a violent death had been predicted for Jeroboam himself; and, in stating that Amos had foretold the captivity of Israel, he says nothing of the sins which led to this doom, or of the hope held out to repentance, or of the prophet's intercession. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12</a></div><div class="verse">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also Amaziah said</span>. Jeroboam appears to have taken no steps in consequence of this accusation, either deeming that the words of a visionary were unworthy of serious consideration, or, like Herod (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>), fearing the people, who had been impressed by the prophet's words and bold bearing. Therefore Amaziah endeavours by his own authority to make Amos leave the country, or else does not wait for the command of the king, who was probably at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">O thou seer!</span> Amaaiah calls Amos <span class="accented">chozeh</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>), either with reference to the visions just given, or in derision of his claims - as we might say, "visionary." <span class="cmt_word">Flee thee away;</span> fly for thine own good to escape punishment, patronizing and counselling him. <span class="cmt_word">Go to the land of Judah;</span> where doubtless your announcement of the ruin of the rival kingdom will be acceptable. <span class="cmt_word">Eat bread.</span> Amaziah speaks, as if Amos was paid for his prophecies, made a gain of godliness. <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy there.</span> "Vaticinare in terra Jude, ubi libenter audiuntur insani" (St. Jerome). The idoloatrous priest has no conception of the inspiration under which the prophet speaks. He judges others by himself, attributing to Amos the sordid motives by which he himself was influenced.

Not the political, but the religious, capital, the chief seat of the religion appertaining to the nation.

As the tree bore many crops of fruit in the year, it would afford constant employment to the dresser (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' 3. p. 1394; 'Bible Educator,' 4, p. 343).

Orelli takes it as an expression of the apathy that accompanies severe and irremediable suffering - suffering too deep for words. The Greek and Latin versions take this onomatopoetic word has! "hush!" as a substantive.

(For the phrase, comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; and to illustrate the idea, refer to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/87-5.htm">Psalm 87:5, 6</a>.) The Messianic kingdom shall be established in order that salvation may be extended to all hastens who embrace it. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">is the saying of Jehovah.</span> This is added to show the immutability of the promise. The covenant God himself hath predicted it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The prophet expatiates upon the rich blessings which shall follow the establishment of the kingdom. Under the figure of a supernatural fertility are represented the victories of grace (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 34:25, etc.). The blessing is founded on the Mosaic promise (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ploughman shall overtake the reaper.</span> Ploughing and harvest shall be continuous, without sensible interval. <span class="cmt_word">The treader of grapes him that soweth seed.</span> The vintage should be so abundant that it should last till sowing time. <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall drop sweet wine.</span> This is from <a href="../../par/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And all the hills shall melt.</span> As Joel says, "shall flow with milk," in this promised land "flowing with milk and honey."

For, as Corn. a Lapide quotes, "Bacchus amat colles" (Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:113). The hyperbolical expressions in the text are not to be taken literally; they depict in bright colours the blessings of the kingdom of Messiah. Material and temporal blessings are generally represented as closely connected with spiritual, and as figurative of them. Such predictions, understood literally, are common in the so called Sibylline Books; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> lib. 3:743, etc., where, among other prodigies, we have - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> One is reminded of the golden age depicted by Virgil in his fourth eclogue.
