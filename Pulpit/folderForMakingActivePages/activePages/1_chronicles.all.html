On the contrary, it is there the natural conclusion of the wars between the Philistines and Saul. This engagement took place (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1, 11</a>) on the plains of Jezreel. The name Jezreel marks either the city (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1, 11</a>), or the cele<span class="accented">brated valley or plain</span> called in later times Esdraelon, the Greek form of the word. The plain in its largest proportions may be said to have been bounded by the Mediterranean (although it is called the plain of Accho, where it abuts on that sea) and the Jordan, and by the Samaria and Carmel ranges on the south and south-west, and those of Galilee on the north and northeast. While called a "plain" and "the great plain" in <a href="../../par/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>, its name in the Old Testament is "valley." It lay like a scalene triangle, with its apex in the direction of the Mediterranean, opening into the above-mentioned plain of Accho, and its sides going from right to left, about fifteen, twelve, and eighteen miles long respectively. The allusions to it in Old Testament history are frequent. Its exceeding richness is now turned into desolation unexceeded. Megiddo (<a href="../../par/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>), the city, centre of a smaller valley called by the same name (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), was situated within it, in the direction of Carmel. (For very full and interesting account of the Jezreel with which we have here to do, and of Esdraelon, see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 336-356, edit. 1866.) <span class="cmt_word">Mount Gilboa</span> identifies for us the exact battle-field of the text. It is the same with that on which Gideon triumphed (<a href="../../par/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1, 8</a>). It is in the lot of Issachar, flanked by the Little Hermon ridge on the north-east, and by Gilboa on the south-east, a mountain range of ten miles long, about six hundred feet high, and mentioned only in the melancholy connection of this history. The flight of the men of Israel and of Saul was from the plain back to their position on Mount Gilboa, where they were pursued, overtaken, and slain. The modern name of the town Jezreel is Zerin, the depraved <span class="accented">aliases</span> of which appear as <span class="accented">Gerin</span> and <span class="accented">Zazzin</span> (Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 3:162-165, 3rd edit.), and Jezreel, Shunem, and Beth-shean are the three most conspicuous places in this part of the whole plain of Esdraelon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-2.htm">1 Chronicles 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Followed hard after</span>. The Hebrew verb implies all this and rather more, viz. that they made the pursuit of <span class="cmt_word">Saul and his sons</span> their one special object. Luther's "Hingen sich au Saul" expresses this forcibly. <span class="cmt_word">Abinadab</span>; or Ishui (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Saul</span>. Omit the article, which is not present in the Hebrew text. The fourth son, not withstanding our ver. 6, survived (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The archers hit him</span>. The literal translation would be, <span class="accented">the shooters</span>, <span class="accented">men with the bow</span>, <span class="accented">found him.</span> The context makes it plain that the meaning is that the arrows of the pursuers rather than the pursuers themselves "found" him, and these made him argue all the rest. To this our Authorized Version has jumped by the one word "hit" him. It is evident from ver. 8 that the Philistines did not find the body of Saul to recognize it till next day. <span class="cmt_word">And he was wounded of the archers</span>. The radical meaning of the verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>) is rather "to twist" (<span class="accented">torquere</span>) or "be twisted," "writhe" (<span class="accented">torqueri</span>). And the meaning here is in harmony with it, that Saul trembled from fear or writhed with the pain already inflicted of the arrows. Hence the parallel passage couples with this same verb, the adverb <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5da;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-4.htm">1 Chronicles 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And abuse me</span>. The main idea of the Hithp. of the verb here used is to <span class="accented">satisfy the</span> thirst of lust or cruelty. Saul probably feared not the abuse of mocking only, but that of torture. In the corresponding passage this verb is preceded by the clause, <span class="cmt_word">and thrust me through. His armour-bearer would not</span>. He refused the request or bidding of Saul, no doubt mainly in respect of the fact that Saul was still "the anointed." We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the armour of the body in the case of the Philistine Goliath (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4-7</a>). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and armour, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, date from so early a period (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-26.htm">Genesis 31:26</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of Scripture are remarkably scanty on this subject. The sword is the earliest mentioned in Scripture, carried in a <span class="accented">sheath</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-27.htm">1 Chronicles 21:27</a>); though the Hebrew word is here different from that used in Samuel. It was slung by a <span class="accented">girdle</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), rested on <span class="accented">hips</span> or <span class="accented">thigh</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>), and was sometimes "two-edged" (<a href="../../par/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>). Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>.

Again as a <span class="accented">lancet</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a>). In addition to these three chief varieties of spear - the spear proper, the javelin, end the lancet - there is mention of two other weapons used at all events as the dart of a light kind would be used, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-10.htm">2 Chronicles 23:10</a>, and elsewhere, and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, respectively. After sword and spear rank the bow and arrow (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) And lastly, the sling (<a href="../../par/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>), and a very strong weapon of the same kind mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>. The chief articles worn as bodily armour were the breastplate (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5, 38</a>); the somewhat obscure habergeon, mentioned only twice, in no connection then of battle (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-23.htm">Exodus 39:23</a>), the original name of which, <span class="accented">tacharah</span>, is found on Egyptian papyri of the nineteenth dynasty, - it seems to have been a species of doublet or corselet; the helmet (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>; ch. 26:14; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>); greaves (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>); two kinds of shield (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7, 41</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>); and lastly the article mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; and of which we can say nothing certainly bearing upon its nature or its use, except that it was made of gold. Armour-bearers, then, the first distinct mention of whom we find in <a href="../../par/judges/9-54.htm">Judges 9:54</a>, may well have been a necessity for kings and for the great. Joab had ten (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>). The word is not expressed as a compound in Hebrew, but as "one carrying (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) arms." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-5.htm">1 Chronicles 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And died</span>. The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-5.htm">1 Samuel 31:5</a>) adds "with him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All his house</span>. In place of these words, the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>) has, "And his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together." This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either passage the moral is plain, that the end and ruin of Saul's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-7.htm">1 Chronicles 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when all the men of Israel that <i>were</i> in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the valley</span>. In place of these words, the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-7.htm">1 Samuel 31:7</a>) has, "On the other side of the valley, and.., on the other side Jordan." We have here a clear instance of the desire of the compiler of Chronicles to compress his narrative, while the fidelity of the parallel narrative is testi-fled in the naturalness of its statements, amounting to this, that, quick as the intelligence or report could reach all those Israelites who were at all within the range of the victorious Philistines, they hastened to vacate their abodes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-8.htm">1 Chronicles 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his sons</span>. The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8</a>) says explicitly, "And his <span class="accented">three</span> sons." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-9.htm">1 Chronicles 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour</span>. Some comparing this with the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>), "They cut off his head, and stripped off his armour," say "our author" leaves the beheading unmentioned! It is certainly sufficiently implied. <span class="cmt_word">To carry tidings unto their idols.</span> This sentence is more clearly explained, and brought into rather unexpected and perhaps unwished accord with the most modern of our ecclesiastical habits, when in the parallel as above, we find "to publish it in the house of their idols "as the form of expression. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of their gods</span>. In place of this general designation, the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>) designates the house more exactly as "the house of Ashtaroth" (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; the Phoenician female deity, as Baal was their male deity. The Greek form of the name is Astarte. See also Cic., 'De. Nat. Deo.,' 3:23). <span class="cmt_word">And fastened his head in the temple of Dagon</span>. The parallel, as above, gives us, "And fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shah" (which account is corroborated in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), and does not say what further was done with the head. It is no doubt remarkable that one historian puts on record the one fact and the other the other; and it is one of the clearer indications that both took from some common sources. It is perhaps something to be remarked also that, while the historian in Samuel says nothing further about the <span class="accented">head</span> (though allusion to it is probably included in the "body" and the "bones," the further account of which is given in vers. 12, 13, as well as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), the compiler of Chronicles does revert to mention of "the <span class="accented">body</span> of Saul," ver. 12, <span class="accented">infra</span>, though without any corresponding naming of Beth-shah. Bertheau finds little difficulty in the question, by simply supposing that the omission in Chronicles is another instance of the desire to compress; while others suppose corruption in our text, or, as Thenius and Ewald, the loss of a sentence to our text. After all said, the omission in Samuel of the fate of the head would seem to be fully as remarkable as the omission, so far as this verse is concerned, in Chronicles of the fate of the body. It is reasonable to suppose that the head and trunk of the body of Saul were brought together again, or it were likely some allusion to the contrary would have transpired in the following verses of this chapter or in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>. With regard to the act of the Philistines in dedicating the armour of Saul, and fixing his head in the temple of Dagon, as though trophies, the custom was both ancient and not uncommon (<a href="../../par/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>). The house of Dagon (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>) here spoken of was that at Ashdod (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>), between Gaza and Joppa. Though belonging to Judah's lot, it was never subdued by Israel, and remained throughout their history one of their worst foes. It is the Azotus of <a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. There was another Dagon temple at Gaza (<a href="../../par/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-31</a>). Dagon's representation was the figure of a man, as to head, hands, and bust, but for the rest that of a fish, which was a symbol of fruitfulness. As Ashdod was situate on the extreme west of Palestine, so Beth-shah  - generally written Beth-shean, a city of Manasseh (ch. 7:29), though within the borders of Issachar (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>), flora which the Canaanites were not expelled (<a href="../../par/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>) - was on the extreme east near the Jordan. It was afterwards called Scythopolis. Considering the distance these were apart, and their contrary directions, we may suppose that some suggestion was intended by the fixing the head in the one place and the body in the other.

Gilead comprised the lots of Reuben and Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5, 25-32, 39-41</a>) and of half Manasseh (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-21.htm">1 Chronicles 27:21</a>). Saul had on a celebrated occasion (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-13</a>) befriended the people of Jabesh-gilead, coming to their rescue against Nahath the Ammonite, of which kindness they are now mindful, show that rarest of virtues, gratitude to a fallen monarch, and are further on (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>) commended for it by David. This verse does not tell us, as the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) does, of the first burning of the bodies, and then of the burying of the calcined bones. The silence is very remarkable. It does name the kind of tree, the "oak" or "terebinth." The word for the tree, however, in both passages is of doubtful and perhaps only generic signification. The several Hebrew words translated in various places as "oak," all share a common root, significant of the idea of <span class="accented">strength.</span> Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 243, 244) says that the country owns still to an abundance of oaks of very fine growth in some cases, and that these are exceedingly more plentiful and altogether a stronger tree than the "terebinth." The different names, though all connected with one root, referred to are probably owing to the large variety of oaks. With the statement of the burying of the bones under a tree, and the fasting of seven days on the part of these brave and grateful men of Jabesh-gilead, the <span class="accented">parallel</span> account comes to its end.

Already David had been anointed at Hebron by "the men of Judah, king over the house of Judah" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). And David continued "king in Hebron over the house of Judah seven years and six months" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Notice the agreement of this date with the account of the six sons born to David in Hebron (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>). The explanation of the chronology for Ishbosheth affecting this period is not easy. It is said that he reigned over Israel "two years" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>). Where was the difference of five and a half years lost? Our first verse here, with its apparently emphatic <span class="cmt_word">then</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), would seem to make it very unlikely that it was lost between the death of Ishbosheth and the kingship of David over "all the tribes of Israel" together with Judah. On the other hand, the interval in question might find its account in the "<span class="accented">long war</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1, 6, 17-21</a>) between the house of Saul and the house of David." There is, however, still possible the supposition that the historian intends to give the intrinsically correct facts of the case, and means that, what with delay before getting the adhesion of the people to Ishbosheth, and what with the early decay of his sovereign power, he could not be said to have <span class="accented">reigned</span> more than two years. This verse, then, shows that the history proper of Chronicles purports to begin from the time of David's rule over the entire and united people, at the exact date of seven and a half years after Saul's death, while no mention is here made of his intermediate partial rule over Judah, or of Ishbosheth's temporary rule over Benjamin and Israel. <span class="cmt_word">All Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), by their representatives, "the elders of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>; as well as our ver. 3). The first nine verses of this chapter cover the same ground as the first ten verses of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>. Unto Hebron. We learn how David came to be here from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>. "And it came to pass after this" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after David's "lamentation over Saul and Jonathan") "that David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron." Hebron was the "earliest seat of civilized life, not of Judah only, but of all Palestine." It and Bethlehem are two of the most special memorials of David. An interesting sketch of the topography and natural features of this place, and a succinct Biblical history of it in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 164 (edit. 1866), from which comes the following quotation: - "Hebron, according to the Jewish tradition, was the primeval city of the vine. Its name indicates <span class="accented">community or society.</span> It was the ancient city of Ephron the Hittite, in whose gate he and the elders received the offer of Abraham, when as yet no other fixed habitation of man was known in central Palestine. It was the first home of Abraham and the patriarchs; their own permanent resting-place when they were gradually exchanging the pastoral for the agricultural life. In its neighbourhood can be traced, by a continuous tradition, the site of the venerable tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and of the double cavern in which he and his family were deposited and perhaps still remain. It was the city of Arba, the old Canaanite chief, with his three giant sons, under whose walls the trembling spies stole through the land by the adjacent valley of Eshcoh Here Caleb chose his portion when, at the head of his valiant tribe, he drove out the old inhabitants, and called the whole surrounding territory after his own name; and here the tribe of Judah always rallied, when it asserted its independent existence against the rest of the Israelite nation. It needs but few words to give the secret of this early selection, of this long continuance of the metropolitan city of Judah. Every traveller from the desert must have been struck by the sight of that pleasant vale, with its orchards and vineyards and numberless wells, and we must add, in earlier times, the groves of terebinths and oaks which then attracted from far the eye of the wandering tribes. This fertility was in part owing to its elevation into the cooler and the more watered region above the dry and withered valleys of the rest of Judaea  - and commanding this fertile valley, rose Hebron, on its crested hill." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh</span>. This is a figurative expression, the pedigree and lineage of which it is interesting to note (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>). The highest service to which it was promoted may be said to be reached, however, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-30.htm">Ephesians 5:30</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-2.htm">1 Chronicles 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt feed my people Israel</span> (so <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>).

A forcible use of this phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>. It implies that the engagement was ratified in the presence of a holy place, a holy vessel of the sanctuary, or a holy person (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>). Whether the tabernacle was now at Hebron is doubtful, but the two priests, Abiathar and Zadok, were. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David</span>. The first time of David's being anointed (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>) Samuel the prophet officiated. The second time (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) was when the "men of Judah" anointed him king over "the house of Judah." This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of "all the elders of Israel," although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord by Samuel</span>. The sentence marks the complete fulfilment of what had been foreshadowed in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12, 13</a>; and it may probably have been the more carefully introduced by the compiler of Chronicles, in consideration of the absence from his own work of previous details and of the previous anointings of David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, which is Jebus</span>. This ancient name of Jerusalem, of Canaanitish date, is found only once beside, viz. in <a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10, 11</a>; the Gentile form of the noun, however, Jebusi, is of more frequent occurrence, and sometimes it is found even as the name of the city (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8, 63</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16, 28</a>). The derivation and meaning of the word are unascertained. Gesenius explains it to mean "a place dry or downtrodden like a threshing-floor." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-5.htm">1 Chronicles 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither.

The <span class="cmt_word">inhabitants of Jebus</span> added something beside (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). They had said, "Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither." <span class="cmt_word">The castle of Zion</span>. This fort became the site of the temple. It is the <span class="accented">Acra</span> of Josephus, and is different from the modern Zion. It was the eastern hill in the city, was the second highest elevation in the city, and up to the time of the destruction of the city of Jerusalem was uniformly named Zion, though from the time of Constantine it has been used for the name of the western hill, the site of <span class="accented">Jerusalem.</span> There is but little doubt of the identity of the hill of Moriah with the hill of Zion, though no individual passage of Scripture asserts it. The passage before us, however, with its parallel, tells us plainly enough that the city of David, and that which became the sacred hill of Zion are one; and many passages in the Psalms and the prophets both confirm this and point out the difference between Zion and Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.

It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David <span class="accented">and others</span>, upon his slaying of Abner (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37</a>); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while "David built...  even from Millo round about,...  Joab repaired the rest of the city." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-7.htm">1 Chronicles 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</div><div class="comm">

There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root "to fill." Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for "<span class="accented">David's wall round Millo</span>," this, viz. "buildings round about the lower city" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those "buildings," etc., with <span class="accented">Acra</span>). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). The Septuagint represents it by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. In the remarkable passage, <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, the word "Silla" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the "steps from the city of David" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), or "the <span class="accented">causeway of going up"</span> to the west of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a>). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> the otherwise unvarying translation (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Septuagint is superseded by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word "foundation," Schleusner translates it "height." Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in "the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion." Some clue may lie in the word "inward," applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city? (See also Keil on Kings, vol. 2:163.)

It plainly belongs to the time of the establishment of David's sway over the whole people.

And a careful comparison of the passages suggests how the omission came about, and that it was but part of a larger omission. Between the sentences, "and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle," and "where was a parcel of ground full of barley" (in our next verse, 13) there is an <span class="accented">hiatus</span> of two verses (viz. those found in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>,  <span class="accented">as latter half of ver.</span> 9, ver. 10, <span class="accented">and former half of ver.</span> 11), and this hiatus was occasioned probably by the recurrence of the expression," and the Philistines were gathered together," in the remaining half of ver. 11 (see Kennicott's Bible, and 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

It was near Shocoh, or Soech, in Judah, some fourteen miles south-west of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Full of barley</span>. The Authorized Version reading in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>) is "full of lentiles," the Hebrew for "barley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, for "lentiles" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of "barley" occurs in <a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>, from which verses we learn that it, together with "flax," was an earlier crop than "rye" and "wheat." It was not only used for food for man (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), but also for horses (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the "jealousy offering" (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, comp. with <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying "to bristle," is in noticeable analogy with the Latin <span class="accented">hordeum</span>, from <span class="accented">horreo.</span> Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the "growing crop," and the plural the "grain" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The <span class="accented">lentile</span>, on the other hand, was a species of <span class="accented">bean</span>, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat <span class="accented">lentile-bread</span>, but, what is more <span class="accented">apropos</span> of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little "barley" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the "parcel" of ground was "full of lentiles," and again "full of barley," the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation.

In that same place Shammah is called the "son of Agee," which probably answers to the "Shage" of the present chapter (ver. 34), where our reading should rather be, "Jonathan the son of Shammah the son of Shage, the Hararite." The word "Hararite" designates, according to Gesenius, "one from the hill-country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hill-country of Judah or Ephraim, and would be equivalent with us to such a description as "the mountaineer."

Adullam, evidently a place of great antiquity (<a href="../../par/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>:l, 12, 20), is mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; it was the seat then of a Canaanite king. It afterwards lay in Judah, in that lowland (called often the Shephelah) that ran from Joppa to Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea. It kept name and fame to the last (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). The "rock" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called <span class="accented">Khureitun</span>, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, "Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it." <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host</span>. For this word "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>) has the "life of the Philistines" (but the Authorized Version, the "troop of"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, and in Samuel <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">valley of Rephaim</span>. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for "valley" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> should mark an <span class="accented">enclosed</span> one. <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> means "giants."

He is right, certainly, if he means that it has received both translations, for see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-19.htm">1 Kings 4:19</a> for the one, and our present passage supplies the other (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>).

If the reference is not as above (see ver. 22), the margin of the parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>) may be followed, which would translate "guard" as <span class="accented">council.</span> This Gesenius adopts, and translates "privy council." There seems, however, no necessity for this, with the references before us above given (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, etc., to which may be added ch. 27:6, which shows Benaiah to be captain of the third division).

The list announced here as comprising "the valiant men of the armies," is unannounced there, but, beginning with the same name, <span class="cmt_word">Asahel</span>, it calls him "one of the thirty," and suggests the inference that those who follow will make up the rest. The number that follows (coinciding in this respect strictly with our list here) is itself thirty, which, though one too many, may be considered satisfactorily accounted for in the fact of the untimely death of Asahel, already recorded (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). Considering the exact crisis at which he died, it is very likely that his place should be compensated for, although his name were unremoved from the honourable list. Amid the difficulties that develop themselves in the <span class="accented">contents</span> of these lists, when compared, the comparison of them aids the conviction that, so far as they go together, they do stand for "the thirty" spoken of in both places, and that a sentence or two here and there, now lost or corrupted beyond recognition, would clear up the whole subject. The comparison also seems to make it clear that the compiler of Chronicles, meaning to go beyond an enumeration of the <span class="accented">thirty</span>, nowhere speaks of thirty after ver. 25. On the other hand, the writer of the account in Samuel carefully sums up all (ver. 39) in the words, "<span class="accented">thirty</span> <span class="accented">and seven in all</span> " - an addition which means either the actual thirty-one given and the two sets of three each; or the thirty, with the two sets of three each and Joab ever all. Our present chapter, however, goes on to the number forty-eight in all, vers. 41-47, adding sixteen to the thirty-two which precede. Beside some minor differences, it must be said that at fewest three names, <span class="accented">Hepher</span>, <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, and <span class="accented">Mibhar</span>, in Chronicles, resist identification with those that should (from position) correspond with them in the list of Samuel and with any others. And the same thing may be said of the same number in the list of Samuel (<span class="accented">Elika</span>, <span class="accented">Eliam</span>, <span class="accented">Bani</span>) when compared with the list now before us. The points of contact and clearest identification are, therefore, in so great a majority and are so uniformly distributed that, although it is left hard to decide the causes of them, these differences cannot throw any discredit upon the list as a whole. Perhaps the most probable suggestion to be offered is that the knowledge of the writer of the Book of Samuel enabled him to supersede the names of such as were soon lost to their brave career by death by other names; or, resting on the same fundamental reason, there may have been two different <span class="accented">editions</span> of the list, to one of which the writer of Samuel was indebted, and to the other the compiler of Chronicles.

David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-7</a>). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3-6</a>). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, "they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep," is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The <span class="accented">middle voice</span> form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag.

Hamath was one of the great cities of the Orontes valley, in Upper Syria, which formed the boundary in especial of the empire of Solomon. This valley is watered by the Orontes, the river of Antioch, a river remarkable for its abundant spring (situate immediately north of the source of the Leontes), which won for it the name, among all the other springs of Syria, of "The Spring," and remarkable for "the length of its course, the volume of its waters, and the rich vegetation of its banks."

This river was to the ancient Romans "the representative of Syria, as the Timings might be said to be of England, and in later times the region formed the chief point of contact between this part of Asia and the West" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 414, <span class="accented">e</span>,<span class="accented">f</span>, edit. 1866).

Beside this Hiram or Huram, the king, there was another Hiram or Huram, the same king's chief artificer, and whom he sent to the help of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11, 16</a>). The willing aid which this king lent to David on this occasion, in supplying cedar timber and workmen, was "the commencement of that amity between the Tyriaus and the Hebrews, so mutually advantageous to the two nations, the one agricultural and the other commercial" (Milman's 'History of the Jews,' 1:239). The meaning of the name Hiram is probably "noble," or "highborn." This disposition, at all events, he seems to have illustrated in his generous friendship to David, Solomon, and their people. Very little to be relied upon is known of him outside Scripture, but his reign is said to have extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 1023-990</span>.

It may be considered either an irregular Niphal third pers. fem.; or Niphal infin, absolute (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>); or possibly even an irregular Piel form, in which case the pronoun "he" will need to be supplied as the subject. Supposing that any special connection subsists between this and the previous verse, it is not necessary to consider it remote. Then, as now, the building of a house for one's self, much more the building of a noble palace on the part of a king, is an indication of feeling settled and "confirmed." It was a partial indication of the "lifted-up kingdom" that the king should have a palace of unwonted magnificence. This must have weighed all the more in the case of a nation which, not for its sacred things, nor for its king, nor for its people, had ever had as yet any adequate and worthy housing,

As matter of course, we do not look in this connection for any remarks to be made by the writer condemnatory of David's enlargement of the harem, or of his having an harem at all. Yet it is open to us to note how, at a time when polygamy was "winked at," and no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David, yet by this very thing he was undermining the peace and unity of his own family, the comfort of his declining years once and again, and the very stability of his house in the days of Solomon his son. The less necessitated we are to regard David's polygamy in the light of individual sin, the more emphatic in the light of history does the <span class="accented">tendency</span> of the practice proclaim itself as thoroughly and irredeemably bad.

From a careful comparison of this passage with the parallel and with <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-12.htm">2 Samuel 23:12-14</a>, it appears likely that the meaning is that "David went out against them" after having "gone down" first to the "hold," probably at the "cave of Adullam" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15-17</a>). When it is said that the Philistines went up to seek David, the sequel makes it evident that they did not seek him as friends. And it is to be remembered that the Philistines held territory near Jerusalem at this time, and to the north of it (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-7.htm">1 Samuel 31:7-9</a>).

The "valley" was south of Jerusalem, but whether more south-east or south-west is not certain; probably the former (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>).

The meaning of the directions as here given is sufficiently evident, yet it is somewhat more forcibly expressed in the parallel place, "Thou shalt not go up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "against the Philistines" (see our tenth verse, and note the form of David's inquiry); "<span class="accented">but</span> <span class="accented">fetch a compass behind them."</span> The mulberry trees were evidently behind the Philistines. The Hebrew word for the trees here spoken of is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and the correct rendering of it is probably neither "mulberry" nor, as the Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "pear" trees. But judging from the probable derivation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to weep), they were trees of the balsam species, and it seems that this is as far as we can safely conjecture. One of the latest authorities (see Condor's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 398, 2nd edit.) pronounces it an "unknown species." The tree, strange to say, is only mentioned here and in the parallel place. A summary of opinions as to the tree intended may be found in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:439, and this is just sufficient to show that it is not as yet identified with any semblance of certainty. However, it is easy to understand hew the balsam species, from which the exuding gum resembles "tears," might come by the name set forth in the present Hebrew root. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-15.htm">1 Chronicles 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A sound of going</span>. This is net a mere generic or longer form of expression to signify a sound itself. There is significance in the word "going." The sense of the Hebrew word would be thrown out more emphatically by such a rendering as, <span class="accented">the sound of steps</span> (literally, <span class="accented">stepping</span>). When the motion of the agitated leaves simulated the sound of steps, the stepping of men, then David and his army were to step forth to battle. Though the root of the "stepping" spoken of as heard in the trees is not identical with that of the "going" repeated twice in the remainder of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">Then thou shalt go out...  for God is gone forth</span> - yet it does alliterate to some extent with it, and rather creates the impression that it was intended to do so. However, the parallel place does not sustain this impression, inasmuch as a different word, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">bestir</span> thyself," is there employed, in place of the first occurrence of our supposed alliteration, in the clause, "Thou shalt go out." There is something stirring to the imagination, and probably it was felt so by David and his men, in the signal unseen yet not unheard, and in a sense not of earth, but midway between earth and heaven. The very various voices of the various trees, according to the character of their foliage, may well set poetry going, and startle or fascinate imagination, as the case may be. The music of one tree or grove is as different from that of another as can be - listen to the difference between the melancholy plaint so unceasing of some plantation of firs, and the multitudinous, silvery, rippling of but one white poplar of good size. Presumably the sound in the present ease more resembled that of the steady tramp of them that march.

These preparations occupied the three months, or part of the three months, spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>. The <span class="cmt_word">houses</span> may have been both his own (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>) and the buildings referred to in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>. The old tent, or <span class="accented">tabernacle</span>, is repeatedly alluded to, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>. It will be remembered that the tabernacle established by Joshua at Shiloh remained there till the time of Eli, and the ark within it (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>). Afterwards we find it removed to Nob, for there David ate the shewbread (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>). From thence, very possibly after the savage slaughter of the priests by the order of Saul, it was removed, and we find it at Gibeon, according to the above references. Here at Gibeon was an altar and "high place," which, in the earlier time of Solomon, formed the chief religious centre. The wanderings of the ark already given from Shiloh, through Philistia to Beth-she-mesh, Kirjath-jearim, Perez-uzzah, now land it in this tent in Jerusalem. It is no more sheltered in the tabernacle. But the tabernacle, as well as the ark, was ultimately brought to the new-built temple of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse together with vers. 12-15 show that the severe lesson of the destruction of Uzzah had been laid to heart, and had made David supremely anxious to take better counsel of the Law. Uzzah, though possibly the son of a Levite, more probably of a Hivite (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7, 17</a>), was not a priest, nor is there any sufficient evidence that he was a Levite; and most distinct was the order of the Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51-53</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-29.htm">Numbers 3:29-32</a>; 4:15420), that "when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." So the sons of Kohath are to come to bear the sanctuary with all its sacred vessels, "but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die." Many things were allowed to be carried on waggons under the charge of the Gershonites and Merarites, but the strict contents of the sanctuary were to be borne in a specified manner by the Kohathites.

The word here employed for "bring" is not the same with the "carry" of vers 1 and 2. But the following verses (13-15) seem to intimate that, whatever the exact reason for which Uzzah had been peremptorily cut off, the Levites had also been to blame in not sanctifying themselves to <span class="accented">carry</span> the ark by its staves in the way originally appointed.

It is plain that from the first stress was laid upon the rings and the staves through them by which the ark was to be carried, as also the "table of shittim wood" (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-26.htm">Exodus 25:26-28</a>) and the "altar" (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-4.htm">Exodus 27:4-7</a>) and the "altar of incense" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-4.htm">Exodus 30:4, 5</a>).

These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains <span class="accented">psalteries on Alamoth</span> to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices.

There is considerable diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this word.

Its exact position here seems not unfavourable to such interpretation. On the other hand, its position in ver. 27 seems conclusively to point to the translation of the Septuagint and of our Authorized Version in this place as the correct one. Dr. Murphy, however, to escape this, thinks "with the singers" in ver. 27 to be a "copyist's inadvertent repetition."

These trumpets were of solid silver, of one piece, were straight and narrow, and had an expanded mouth. They are found on the arch of Titus, and are described by Josephus. On the other hand, the trumpet, more correctly rendered "cornet" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, as distinguished from our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which was used for proclaiming the jubilee, for announcing the new year for sentinel and other special signals, and for war, was shaped like a ram's horn, and probably made of the same.

The</span> original number of the silver trumpets was two only, and they were to be sounded strictly by the anointed priests, sons of Aaron, at all events when their employment was within the sanctuary. Their employment, however, grew far more general, and we find (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>) that their number had risen to a hundred and twenty (so too <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).

The word in both of those verses that represents the dancing, does correctly so represent, bet is a somewhat generic form, as it carries the idea of dancing in a circle. The reason of Michal "despising David in her heart" can only be found in the unreason and the irreligion of that heart itself. She was a type of not a few, who despise devotion, enthusiasm, and above all practical liberality and generosity, on the part of any individual of their own family, when these are shown to Christ and his Church, and when they think they may be a trifle the poorer for it, or when they feel that the liberality and devotion of another exposes their own "poverty" in both these respects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_chronicles/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_chronicles/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm"><title>1 Chronicles 16 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_chronicles/16.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_chronicles/16.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_chronicles/16-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_chronicles/15.htm" title="1 Chronicles 15">&#9668;</a> 1 Chronicles 16 <a href="../1_chronicles/17.htm" title="1 Chronicles 17">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1</a></div><div class="verse">So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it</span>. So ch. 15:1 distinctly states that David had "pitched a tent" for the ark, and evidently to be ready for its arrival. On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-12.htm">1 Chronicles 13:12, 13</a>), for a while, at all events. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (tent) of the original designates, when Intended strictly, a haircloth covering, resting on poles or planks (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14, 19</a>). The first occasion of the use of the word is found in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (booth) was made of leaves and branches interwoven (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 40, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (tabernacle) was the dwelling-place or pavilion, which owned to the ten inner curtains as well as the outer covering and the framework (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 12-15</a>, etc.; Exodus 39:32; 40:2, 29). The first occurrence of this word is in the first of these last-quoted references. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt sacrifices and peace offerings</span>. The identical words of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17, 18</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "burnt offerings and peace offerings." These were the two great sacrifices - the former speaking of atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>, etc.), the latter of <span class="accented">reconciliation effected</span> and the enjoyment of peace (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-5</a>, etc.). Neither here nor in the parallel place is any mention made of the altar upon which these sacrifices were offered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He blessed the people in the name of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reverently in the Name of the Lord, and as vividly conscious of being in his presence, he pronounces blessings upon the people, and by short ejaculatory prayer and holy wish further begs for them those blessings which God only can give. In the time of David and Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>) the king realized far more closely the idea of the paternal relation to the people than had ever been since the time of the patriarchs of the elder days. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Each little clause of this verse is replete with interest. The royal giver, who now <span class="cmt_word">dealt to every one of Israel</span>, was, after all, but a channel; yes, and only one channel, through which the fulness and the bounty of the royal Giver of every good and perfect gift, of all good whatsoever, of all things necessary to life and godliness, are supplied to every one of his creature-subjects. But it is highest honour, as servant and instrument alone, to figure forth him in any way. The second little clause tells us either that <span class="cmt_word">women</span> took a recognized place on occasion of this joyous festival, or that the hospitality of such an occasion did not forget them and their homes. And the following three little clauses require closer examination. The word here translated "loaf" in the expression <span class="cmt_word">loaf of bread</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, for which in this sense we may turn to <a href="../../par/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>. The corresponding word, however, in the parallel place is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (for which see <a href="../../par/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-15.htm">Numbers 6:15, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20</a>). The essential meaning of the former word is a <span class="accented">circle</span>, hence applied to the cake because of its shape, and of the latter word <span class="accented">perforation</span>, hence applied to the cake because it was perforated. <span class="cmt_word">A good piece of flesh</span>. This is the Authorized Version rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, which occurs only in the parallel place and here. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">assatura bubulae carnis</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. The imagined derivation of the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (ox) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (fire), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (to burn), seems to be what has led to these translations, helped, perhaps, by the apparent convenience of adapting <span class="accented">meat</span> from the sacrifice to the <span class="accented">bread.</span> But Gesenius, Rodiger, Keil, and others prefer the derivation <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to measure), and they would render "a measure" of wine. <span class="cmt_word">And a flagon</span>.

But there is no doubt, or but little, that the rendering should rather be "dried, pressed cakes of raisins or grapes." It is then to be derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (to press). The substantive has both masculine and feminine form in plural.

The verse seems to describe what should be the essence of that service. It was threefold - <span class="cmt_word">to record, to thank</span>, and to praise the Lord God of Israel. The word here used for "record" is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to remember), and is remarked upon by Gesenius as a title strictly appropriate to the character of the two psalms Psalms 38 and Psalms 70, on the head of which it stands, as meaning, "to make others remember" (see also such passages as <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>). The minds of the people were to be refreshed in this service and in their very psalm of praise (so note in this sense vers. 8, 9, 12, 21, etc.), by being reminded or told, so far as the youngest of them might be concerned, of God's marvellous and merciful deeds for their forefathers of many, many a generation. Then they were to give intelligent and hearty thanks. And, lastly, they were to offer to approach that purest form of worship which consists in adoring praise. One might imagine with what zest they would have accepted, with what fervour they would have added lip and instrument of music to it - that one verse which needed the revolution yet of nearly another three thousand years, that it might flow from the devotion or' Addison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When all thy mercies, O my God,<br />My rising soul surveys,<br />Transported with the view I'm lost<br />In wonder, love, and praise."</span>

The contents of this verse put us, then, into possession of this much, that Asaph presided (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a>) at this musical service, and that his instrument was the cymbals (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>), with which time was kept; that Zechariah was next to him, and, with eight others formed a band, who played on <span class="cmt_word">psalteries</span> (or lutes) and <span class="cmt_word">harps</span>. If we may guide ourselves by vers. 20, 21 of the preceding chapter, three of these - viz. Mattithia, Jeiel, Obed-edom  - performed on the harp, the other six on the psaltery, or lute.

David makes selections from four psalms already known; for it cannot be supposed that the verses we have here were the original, and that they were afterwards supplemented. The first fifteen verses (viz. 8-22) are from <a href="../../par/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1-15</a>. The next eleven verses (23-33) are from <a href="../../par/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a>; but a small portion of the first and last of these verses is omitted. Our thirty-fourth verse is identical with <a href="../../par/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-1.htm">Psalm 118:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>; and forms the larger part of <a href="../../par/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. It is, in fact, a doxology. And our thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses consist of a short responsive ("and say ye") invocation, followed by another doxology. These are taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47, 48</a>. Hereupon "all the people" are directed to find the final outburst of praise to Jehovah, and "Amen." In the first of these selections (vers. 8-23) there is no material variation from the language of the psalm itself. Yet the original psalm has <span class="accented">Abraham</span>, where our own thirteenth verse reads <span class="accented">Israel.</span> And the original psalm uses the third person, where our fifteenth and nineteenth verses have the second person. In the second selection it is worthy of note that our ver. 29, "Come before him," probably preserves the ante-temple reading, while <a href="../../par/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a> was afterwards, to fit temple times, altered into, "<span class="accented">Come</span> <span class="accented">into his courts."</span> The arrangement of all the succeeding clauses does not exactly agree with the arrangement of them found in the psalm, as for instance in the latter half of our ver. 30 and in ver. 31, compared with the clauses of vers. 10,11 of the psalm. Again, one clause of the tenth verse of the psalm, "He shall judge the people righteously," is not found in either alternative position open to it through the inversion of clauses, in our vers. 80, 81. The rhythm and metre of the psalm are, however, equally unexceptionable. The whole of the twenty-nine verses of this Psalm of praise (vers. 8-36 inclusive) are divided into portions of three verses each, except the portion vers. 23-27 inclusive which consists of five verses. As regards the matter of it, it may be remarked on as breaking into two parts, in the first of which (vers. 8-22) the people are reminded of their past history and of the marvellous providence which had governed their career from Abraham to the time they were settled in Canaan, but in the second (vers. 23-36) their thought is enlarged, their sympathies immensely widened, so as to include all the world, and their view is borne on to the momentous reality of <span class="accented">judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - These verses are an animated invocation to thanks and praise.

The suggestion in the midst of the unbounded gladness of this day is affecting, and must have been intended for salutary lesson and timely warning. In the midst of the fulness of praise and joy, the people are led to prayer - say ye - and the prayer is an humble petition for salvation, union, and protection from every enemy. God's treatment of his anointed people had been on his part one continued protection and one prolonged salvation. Yet they had often neither prayed for these nor acknowledged them. Now they are led again by the hand, as it were, to the footstool of the throne.

And the first of them may be considered to mark an important step in advance in the crystallizing of the world's ecclesiastical institutions. Asaph and his brethren of song are <span class="cmt_word">left there before the ark of the covenant...  to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required</span>. A permanent local ministry and choir are thus established, with a fixity of place on Zion, and regularity of time that had been hitherto unattainable.

Explanation is needed of the <span class="accented">plural</span> pronoun "their." Either another name is wanted with Obed-edom, or tacit reference is made to "Asaph and his brethren," as though the name Asaph had not been followed in its own place by the clause "and his brethren." Keil draws attention to the "three score and two" of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>, in connection with the <span class="cmt_word">three score and eight</span> of this place; and it has been proposed to make up this number by some of the sons of <span class="cmt_word">Hosah</span>, of our following verse and of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">1 Chronicles 26:11</a>. In this case the name Hesah might be the name missing before, "and their brethren." Conjecture, however, has not sufficient clue here to warrant it, and the textual state of this verse must be debited with the obscurity. The ambiguity respecting the name Obed-edom has already (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>) been alluded to. Neglecting this ambiguity, it may be repeated that <span class="cmt_word">Obed-edom,...  son of Jedithun</span> (as the Keri of this passage is) was a Merarite Levite, while Obed-edom son of Jeduthun (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>) was of Gath-rimmon, a Gittite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>), a Kohathite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-66.htm">1 Chronicles 6:66, 69</a>), and a Korhite (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-5</a>).

It is now brought into prominence that the ark and the tabernacle are in two separate places. The great ordinary sacrifices and services, "all that is written in the Law of the Lord," are carefully observed on the original altar (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>) in the tabernacle. Other and special sacrifices evidently were offered in the presence of the ark.

The present passage first tells us where it had been since the slaughter of the priests at Saul's command by Doeg the Edomite. Some distinct statement, like that of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, might have been expected here<span class="cmt_word">.

David's thoughts respecting the honour due to God and to the ark of the covenant had time to grow into convictions, and they were greatly and rightly stimulated by reflection on his own surroundings of comfort, of safety, of stability and splendour. He revolves the possible methods and the right methods of showing that honour due. The completion of his own house, one presumably fit for the permanent abode of the King of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>), is the clear demonstration to him that the ark should not dwell in a mere tent. It is a true touch of life, when it is written that as <span class="cmt_word">David sat in his house</span> these thoughts possessed him, and so strongly. The exact time, however, here designed, and the exact occasion of his revealing the thoughts that burned within him, to Nathan, do not appear either here or in the parallel place. In the opinion of some, an indication of some interval having elapsed is found in the words (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>), "The Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies;" while others consider those words to refer to the victories gained over the Philistines, as recorded in ch. 14. <span class="cmt_word">Nathan the prophet</span>. This name suddenly breaks upon us, without any introduction, here for the first time. Nathan is emphatically entitled "the prophet," but perhaps merely to distinguish him from Nathan, David's eighth son. Amid many other important references to Nathan, and which speak for themselves, must be specially noted <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>. And it will be noticed from the former of these references, in particular how Nathan is the prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>); not (like Samuel and Gad) seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>). Possibly he is intended in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a><span class="cmt_word">. An house of cedars</span>. The cedar here spoken of does, of course, not answer to our red, odorous cedar. The word employed is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span>, in the plural number. The first Biblical use of this word is found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4, 6, 49-52</a>. It is derived by Gesenius from an obsolete word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>, from the grip and the firmness of its roots. It is probably the <span class="accented">derived</span> signification, therefore, that should be adhered to (as in the Authorized Version), and not the original, where in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>, the plural of the passive participial is found, "made of cedar," not with A. Schultens, "<span class="accented">made</span> <span class="accented">fast."</span> The cedar genus belonging to the order Coniferae, is odoriferous, very lasting, and without knots. The numerous good qualities which it possesses are spoken to in the variety of uses, and good kind of uses, to which it was put - these all crowned by the almost solitary spiritualized appropriation of the tree, found in <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>. From a comparison of <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6, 8</a> (in the Hebrew, 20, 22) with <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3, 8</a>, and some other passages, we may be led to believe that the <span class="accented">cedar</span> as the name of timber was used occasionally very generically. Nevertheless, the very passages in question instance by name the other specific kinds of wood. Two of the chief kinds of cedar were the Lebanon and the Deodara, which is said not to have grown in Syria, but abounds in the Himalayas. And as the use of the Lebanon cedar for some <span class="accented">purposes</span> (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> for the <span class="accented">masts</span> of ships) is almost out of the question, it is exceedingly probable that this <span class="accented">Deodars</span> and some other varieties of pines are comprehended under the <span class="accented">eh-rez.</span> Dean Stanley points out what may be described as very interesting moral <span class="accented">landmark</span> uses of the celebrated cedars of Lebanon, in those passages which speak of Solomon's sweep of knowledge, commencing in the <span class="accented">dewing</span> direction from them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>), of the devouring fire that should begin with the bramble and reach high up to those cedars (in Jotham's parable, <a href="../../par/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>), and (in the parable of Joash, King of Israel, to Amaziah, King of Judah, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-18.htm">2 Chronicles 25:18</a>) of the contempt with which the family of the cedars of Lebanon is supposed to hear of the matrimonial overtures of the family of the thistles of Lebanon. Stanley's pages ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 414-414d) are full of interest on the subject of the cedars of Lebanon (see also full article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:285, 286; and Dr. Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' pp. 197-200). Cedar was the choice wood for pillars and beams, boarding and ceiling of the finest houses; and alike the first and second temples (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>) depended upon the supply of it. <span class="cmt_word">Under curtains</span>. Here rightly in the plural, though our parallel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>) shows the singular (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-8.htm">Exodus 36:8-19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-2.htm">1 Chronicles 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse gives Nathan's response on the spur of the moment. And that it was not radically wrong from a prophet may be inferred from the stress afterwards laid upon the acceptableness to God of what had been in the heart of David to do. Even with God, silence would sometimes be understood by a prophet to be equivalent to assent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-3.htm">1 Chronicles 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The express word of God came, however, that same night. It proved to be an overruling word. But it brought with it the point of a fresh and most welcome new departure for David. We might glean here by the way a suggestion of the beneficent operation of express revelation, superseding the thought, the method, the reason of man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-4.htm">1 Chronicles 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-15.</span> - These verses are the unfolding to David of the magnificent and far-stretching purposes of God's grace towards him in his son Solomon and his descendants for ever. The revelation is made by the mouth of Nathan. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Thou shalt not build. The Hebrew marks the personal pronoun here as emphatic," Not <span class="accented">thou</span> shalt build," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> but some one else. In the parallel this prohibition is conveyed by that interrogative particle which expects the answer No, and may be thus translated: "Is it thou shalt build for me," etc.? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">1 Chronicles 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - This verse contains the three terms - <span class="cmt_word">house, tent, tabernacle</span> (see notes on 1 Chronicles 16:1). Gesenius observes that when the Hebrew of the last two words is used distinctively, the tent describes the outer coverings of the twelve curtains; and the tabernacle, the ten inner curtains and framework as well, in other words, the whole equipment of the well-known tabernacle. As compared with the version we have here, the parallel place speaks an almost pathetic condescension, "I was a shifting traveller in tent and tabernacle." God meant to remind David how surely and faithfully he had shared the pilgrim lot and unsettledness of his people. What most holy the tabernacle contained was herein a type of the bodily tabernacle of Jesus Christ in later times. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The judges of Israel</span>. The substitution of the Hebrew character <span class="accented">beth</span> for <span class="accented">pe</span>, in the word "judges," would make it "tribes," and bring it into harmony with the parallel place. But the succeeding clause, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I commanded to feed my people</span>, would rather suggest that the parallel place, which adds the same clause, should be brought into harmony with this (see again ver. 10 of this chapter). The general meaning and the gracious spirit underlying it is evident enough. God had never made a suggestion to tribe, or leader of tribe, nor to judge, who had been temporarily raised up to lead, and so to feed, all his people Israel, to build him an house. He had shared their lot, and had shared it unmurmuringly. He also "had not opened his mouth" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67-71</a>). Note also the expression, "I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16</a>). It is to be remarked that we learn from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a> and 1 Chron 28:3 the fuller causes why David was not to be permitted to be the builder of the house. It is not apparent why those causes are not recited here. The same remark applies to the parallel place.

The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> strictly signifies a resting or place of resting.

The sheepcote was sometimes a tower, with roughly built high wall, exposed to the sky at the top, used for protection from wild beasts at night; sometimes the sheepfold was a larger low building of different shape, to which a fenced courtyard was adjacent, where the peril of cold or of wild beast was less imminent. The word of our present passage, however, cannot be compared with these places; comp. rather <a href="../../par/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-10.htm">Isaiah 65:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-13.htm">Hosea 9:13</a>, as above.

The time here denoted will stretch from the people's occupation of the laud to the death of Saul, as the expression, "at the beginning," in ver. 9, will point to the experience of Egyptian oppression. <span class="cmt_word">Will build thee an house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will guarantee thee an unfailing line of descendants.

They were early perceived to be prophecies also, and of the highest significance and application (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-26.htm">Psalm 89:26-37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>). The alternative of the "son who commits iniquity" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>) is omitted from the middle of our thirteenth verse. The latter half of ver. 13 manifestly purports to say, "I will not take my mercy away from Solomon, as I did take it away from Saul." The close of our fourteenth verse is in the parallel place (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>) distinctly referred to David, with the use of the second person possessive pronoun.

His appreciation of the contents of that promise is expressed in a manner which would seem to indicate that he was not altogether untaught, even then, by the Spirit of some of the deeper significance of the far-reaching promise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sat before the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before the ark. It has surprised many that it should be said that David sat before the Lord, in the act of prayer or devotion. But this was not altogether unusual (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>) in the first place; and then, secondly, it is not quite clear that this <span class="accented">is</span> said. Possibly he sat awaiting first some such token as he might know how to construe into the presence of Jehovah, and into his gracious vouchsafing to give him audience, and thereupon he may have altered his attitude. Confessedly, however, the other is the morn natural reading. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-17.htm">1 Chronicles 17:17</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - David here makes a clear sad very just difference between all that had been done for him, and the very great prospect now in addition put before him<span class="cmt_word">: Thou...  hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou hast treated me, or dealt with me, in this promise as though [ had been of high rank indeed. The parallel reading is very concise (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a>), and perhaps somewhat obscure, "And is this the manner [or, 'law'] of man?" or, "And this is to be a law of man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this continuity of a great while to come. Elliptical as this reading may seem, there is no real difficulty in feeling its essential harmony with the passage before us. David's unfeigned surprise and joy in the "<span class="cmt_word">great while to come"</span> nature of the promises made to him and his house overpower all else in his estimation. It is, indeed, a most opportune emphasis that he lays upon this element of the full promise, and accords exceptionally well with our later knowledge and brighter light. Our Authorized Version rendering throws out sufficiently this surprise, and gives not inadequately the drift of the passage. The continuity and exaltedness of the promise, which was only fully realized in the greater Son of David, the Christ, might well astonish David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-18.htm">1 Chronicles 17:18</a></div><div class="verse">What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant</span>. The Septuagint Version has not got these words on their first occurrence. They may have found their way in wrongfully out of the next clause. They are not found in the parallel place. If they remain, they can mean nothing else than "How can David further acknowledge the honour conferred on thy servant," - a sense by no means far-fetched. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy servant's sake</span>. The parallel place reads, "For thy word's sake." This reading is superior, and well suits the connection, suggesting also whether the first occurrence of the word "servant" in the previous verse might not be similarly explained. The similarity of the characters of the words in the Hebrew would render easy the exchange of the one word for the other.

The transition is awkward, no way in harmony with the other short clauses of the passage, and it would be inexplicable except for the alternative open to us, of regarding it as a quotation from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, brought in regardless of the context into which it was introduced. The difficulty does not meet us in our present passage, being obviated by the other sentences of our compiler. Both places, however, manifestly quote from the Book of Deuteronomy, with the grand passages and grand verbiage of which we may well imagine David familiar. A similar familiarity is also betokened in the following verses, as regard other Pentateuchal passages.

Its literal signification is "the bridle or curb of the mother city," and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David "subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself," quoting the Arabian proverb, To <span class="accented">give</span> one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him. He quotes also <a href="../../par/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>.

Much doubt has been entertained as to the meaning of this word. Its etymology is uncertain. Gesenius derives it from a root signifying "hardness." For the most part, however, the context of the seven places of its occurrence which he instances (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>) favour the rendering "shields," though the quotation from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a> (literally, "fill ye the shields") is not so satisfactory.

It is now called a sea, because of its large size. The use of the original laver is plainly told, for the priests to wash at it their hands and feet before offering sacrifices. It stood in the court of the tabernacle, between the altar and the door. The ten lavers of Solomon's temple were used for washing the sacrificial victims themselves (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>). The brazen sea (which was rather of <span class="accented">copper</span> than brass, however) rested upon twelve standing oxen, three turning their faces to each quarter of the heavens. Its height was five cubits, its diameter ten cubits, the thickness of its metal a handbreadth, and its capacity variously given at two thousand baths (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-26.htm">1 Kings 7:26</a>) or three thousand (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>). It was removed from its supports of oxen by Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>), and placed on a pedestal of stone.

The parallel place omits to say that it was by aid of Abishai that David slew these eighteen thousand Edomites. They are there called Syrians, which reading is at all events in keeping with the Aram of the previous verse. Abishai, here named son of Zeruiah, possibly served under "Joab son of Zeruiah" (ver. 15), who is spoken of (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>) as very trenchant in this Edomite war, without any mention being made of Abishai. <a href="../../par/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>.

The phrase occurs twice with the article expressed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>.

The real situation of this place is still doubtful. Since the time of the German traveller Geethen ('Reisen,' 2:356), and of Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:109), it has been generally assumed to be a tract of land extending some six miles south of the Dead Sea, and bounded at that distance by the range of hills which there runs across the country; but beside the consideration that the word "ravine" could not describe that tract of country, there are others very unfavourable to the supposition (see these carefully stated by Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1097).

The historical development of this title is obscure, and not easy to trace. The use of some form or other of the root is abundantly frequent from the times of the earliest parts of Scripture, in the sense of "numbering," or "declaring," or "recording." Perhaps our title of "secretary" would answer sufficiently to it, and all the better, because the Old Testament scribes were also of different leading kinds, like in some degree to our various secretaries of state. There was the kind of scribe of <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a> - where our Authorized Version is far from the mark, and should rather read "the staff of the scribe," in place of "the pen of the writer" - a military officer, whose duty it was to keep the muster-roll. There was the scribe of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>  - a passage which throws light on the former (see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>). There were the scribes of a more literary, lawyer-like, or clerk-like kind, as here, and in the parallel place, and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>. In the time of Hezekiah, if not before, the scribes became distinctly a class of men (<a href="../../par/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>); and the times of the Captivity greatly enlarged their importance. Their exact duties in the best times of the monarchy are not laid down, but the dignified place the king's scribe held is evident from the company in which he is placed here and in the parallel passage.

The meaning and derivation of these two names leave it possible to translate them at once, and to read, "the public executioners, and the public couriers," not treating them as proper names, and to this course Geseuius (see 'Lexicon') gives his sanction. On the other hand, a comparison of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a> would lead us to treat them as the names of people, although the Pelethites are net as identifiable in this sense as the Cherethites and Gittites. Anyway, it is evident they were the special guard of the king, and were faithful to David and to Solomon after him. Their duties included those of the executioner or <span class="accented">lictor</span>, and the courier. They are frequently mentioned on special occasions of the king's moving, and of danger (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-7.htm">2 Samuel 20:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38, 44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Chief about the king</span>.

With this the statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 6:05, &sect; 3), would tally, which says that the Nahash of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>. was killed in the destruction of the Ammonite army then wrought by Saul. Possibly the word "Nahash" was the official title of kings of the Ammonites (and, though considering its signification, <span class="accented">i.e. serpent</span>, scarcely a flattering one from a modern point of view, yet this is overruled by the association of the attribute of <span class="accented">wisdom</span> with the serpent in olden time, of which we have more than a trace in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), as "Pharaoh" of kings of Egypt, etc.

It is, however, very remarkable that we find a genuine kindliness towards David still cleaving to the succession of Ammonite kings, even after the events of this chapter (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>).

The parallel place makes the resemblance close, in that it tells us that "one-half of their beards" was shaved. To shave them was an affront to their customs, dignity, and religion: to shave them half added mockery; and to cut off half their garments completed the tale of ignominious and contemptuous insult (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>).

From comparing this verso with ver. 16, it may seem probable that those strictly called "<span class="accented">of Mesopotamia"</span> lent either no aid at first or but very partial. It is observable that the numbers of men supplied by Beth-rehob, Zobah, and Ishtob in the parallel place (viz. <span class="accented">thirty-two thousand</span>) agree with the numbers of this verse, from which we may conclude that, whatever Aram-beth-rehob (probably either Reho-both on the Euphrates, or Rehob last of Lebanon) and Aram-naharaim may <span class="accented">strictly</span> stand for respectively, they here substantially mean the same. It is possible that the difference is that of a corrupt text or careless copying. The Aram-naharaim (<span class="accented">Mesopotamia</span>), which comes before us first in <a href="../../par/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>, passes out of Scripture language after the defeats of this chapter - the tract of country which it designated (some seven hundred miles by twenty to two hundred and fifty) being absorbed, first by Assyria, and afterwards by Babylon. The <span class="accented">Assyrian Inscriptions</span> reveal the fact that Mesopotamia was the prey of a largo number of small separate tribes at the period of the judges and the early Jewish monarchy, which is quite consistent with the glimpses we here get of it and its people<span class="cmt_word">. Aram-maachah</span> probably designates the tract of country north of East Manasseh, bordering on Palestine, and bounded by the Jordan, Mount Hermon, and on its east, Salcah. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, note; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>).

LIST OF GENERATIONS FROM ADAM TO NOAH. These verses contain a line of genealogical descents, ten in number, from <span class="cmt_word">Adam</span> to <span class="cmt_word">Noah</span>, adding mention of the three sons of the latter. The stride from Adam to Seth, and the genealogy's entire obliviousness of Cain and Abel, are full of suggestion. All of these thirteen names in the Hebrew and in the Septuagint Version, though not those in the Authorized Version, are facsimiles of those which occur in <a href="../../par/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>. They are not accompanied, however, here, as they are there, by any chronological attempt. Probably the main reason of this is that any references of the kind were quite beside the objects which the compiler of this work had in view. It is, however, possible that other reasons for this chronological silence may have existed. The uncertainities attaching to the chronology found in Genesis, as regards this table, may have been suspected or evident - uncertainties which afterwards proclaim themselves so loudly in the differences observable between the Hebrew, Samaritan, and Septuagint versions. Thus the Hebrew text exhibits the total aggregate of years from Adam to the birth of Noah, as amounting to one thousand and fifty-six; the Samaritan version to seven hundred and seven only; and the Septuagint to as many as sixteen hundred and sixty-two; nevertheless, all three agree in adding five hundred years onward to the birth of Shem, and another hundred years to the coming of the Flood. It must be remarked of this first genealogical table, whether occurring here or in Genesis, that, notwithstanding its finished appearance, notwithstanding the impression it undoubtedly first makes on the reader, that it purports to give all the intervening generations from the first to Shem, it may not be so; nor be intended to convey that impression. It is held by some that names are omitted, and with them of course the years which belonged to them. There can be no doubt that this theory would go far to remove several great difficulties, and that some analogies might be invoked in support of it, from the important genealogies of the New Testament. The altogether abrupt opening of this book - a succession of proper names without any verb or predication - cannot be considered as even partially compensated by the first sentence of ch. 9, "So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah." This verse applies directly to the genealogies of Israel and the tribes, beginning ch. 2:1, while under any circumstances, we must look on the first portion of this book as a series of tables, here and there slightly annotated, and suddenly suspended before the eyes.

After the mention of Noah's three sons, in the order of their age (though some on slender ground think Ham the youngest), this order, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, is reversed; and the compiler, beginning with <span class="cmt_word">Japheth</span>, the youngest, apparently with the view of disposing of what his purpose may not so particularly require, gives the names of seven sons and seven grandsons, viz. three through <span class="cmt_word">Gomar</span>, the eldest son, and four through <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>, the fourth son. These fourteen names are identical in the Authorized Version with the list of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-4</a>.

At the close of this short enumeration, we have in Genesis the statement, "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations." It is evident here also that, whether the compiler borrowed from the Book of Genesis itself, or from some common source open to both, his objects are not exactly the same. Time and the present position and condition of that part of his people for which he was writing governed him, and dictated the difference. Accordingly we do not pause here on the colonizings and the fresh seats and habitations of the sons and grandsons of <span class="accented">Japheth.</span> The subject, one of extreme interest, and the threads of it perhaps not so hopelessly lost as is sometimes thought, belongs to the place in Genesis from which the above verse is cited. It may, however, be written here that the rather verbose disquisitions of Joseph Mede are neither altogether unin-retorting nor in some parts of them unlikely. They form Discourses 47, 48, bk. 1.

And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city." And again, at the close of the enumeration of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, follow the statements, "And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

But the place Zimira, in company with Arpad, is found in the Assyrian inscriptions of Sargon, n.o. 720, leaving little cause to hesitate in accepting the identification of Michaelis (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 233). Certainty, however, cannot be felt on the subject.

THE LIST OF SHEM'S DESCENDANTS TO ABRAM. This list is broken in two; it pauses a moment exactly halfway to Abram, at the name <span class="cmt_word">Peleg</span>, to mention Peleg's brother <span class="cmt_word">Joktan</span> and Joktan's thirteen sons. Then, repeating the first five names of lineal descent, and picking up the thread at Peleg, the list gives the remaining five to Abram. In the first half of this list, we have apparently the names of nine sons of Shem, but, as Genesis explains, really the names of five sons, and through Aram, the last of them, the names of four grandsons. Another grandson, through Arphaxad the third son, follows, and through this grandson two consecutive lineal descents bring us, in the name Peleg, half-way to Abram. It is here the lineal table pauses to give Joktan and his thirteen sons. The names then in this portion of the list are twenty-six in number. In the Authorized Version they correspond with those in Genesis, except that <span class="cmt_word">Meschech</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>) here is called Mash (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) there; <span class="cmt_word">Shelah</span> here is spelled Salah there; and <span class="cmt_word">Ebal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) here is written Obal (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) there. The difference between the Hebrew texts justifies the first and last of these variations in the Authorized Version, but in all other respects those texts are in entire accord with one another, for this paragraph. The Septuagint gives very little of this portion of the list. It corresponds, whether with the Hebrew or the Authorized Version, only as far as to the name Arphaxad, after which it carries down the line at once to Abram by the remaining eight names as given in our twenty-fourth to twenty-seventh verses. Nor is it in agreement with its own version in Genesis, which has points of important variation with the Hebrew text also. It is then at this break of the list that, after the names of Joktan's sons, we have in Genesis these words, "And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lauds, after their nations. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the Flood." Upon this follows the account of Babel, in nine long verses, and then a chronological summary is furnished in lineal descent <span class="accented">only</span> from Shem to Abram. It is with the names in this chronological summary that those in this second part of our list (vers. 24-27) are found to agree. But any attempt at reproduction of the chronology found in Genesis is again absent here. At this point a significant stage of these genealogies is reached. The ever-broadening stream of population now narrows again. Two thousand years have flown by, then Abraham appears on the stream and tide of human life. Of that long period the life of Adam himself spanned nearly the half. So far we learn without partiality of all his descendants in common. But henceforth, the real, the distinct purpose of the genealogy becomes apparent, in that the line of the descendants of Abraham, and that by one family, alone is maintained, and proves to be a purpose leading by one long straight line to Christ himself. With Abraham "the covenant of innoceney," long forfeited in Adam, is superseded by the everlasting "covenant of grace," and we lose sight in some measure of Adam, the "common father of our flesh," to think of a happier parentage found in Abraham, the "common father of the faithful."

That these stand in the inverse order of their birth and age requires no explanation. The distinct and separate mention of these two sons, apart from all the others, is of course in harmony with <a href="../../par/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12, 13</a>, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed." Although stated in the first place in the order of importance, and Isaac takes precedence of Ishmael, the name of this latter and of his posterity are treated of first.

The sons are six; the grandsons, two by the son placed second in order, and five by the son placed fourth in order; in all thirteen names.

Of <span class="accented">Esau</span>, the names of five sons are given; and of seven grandsons by the first in order, and four grandsons by the second in order of these sons. In <a href="../../par/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1-5</a> we have the names of the five sons of Esau, which correspond in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text exactly with those of this list. We have there in addition the names of their mothers respectively, who were "daughters of Canaan," Adah of the Hittites, mother of the first; Bashamath of the Ishmaelites, mother of the second (and by these two lines came the seven and four grandsons); and Aholibamah of the Hivites, mother of the remaining three sons. The names correspond also in the Septuagint in the two places, with the minute differences of Eliphaz and Ieoul here, for <span class="accented">Eliphas</span> and <span class="accented">Ieous</span> there. Then follow the names of seven grandsons of Esau though his son <span class="cmt_word">Eliphaz</span>, of whom the first five are found and in agreement (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>), with the exception of <span class="cmt_word">Zephi</span> here for Zepho there, both in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text. But the sixth name here, Timna, is explained in Genesis as the name of a concubine of Eliphaz, by whom he had the son <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>, who appears here as the seventh son. There can be no doubt that we come here upon a transcriber's error, and it would be easily amended if we read "and by Timna, Amalek," <span class="accented">vice</span> "and Timna and Amalek." If this be the correct account of the matter, the grandsons of Esau of course count one fewer here. These two names also tally in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text in the two places; while for all seven names the agreement in the Septuagint is exact, except that we read Gootham here for Gothom there. There remain, in ver. 37, four grandsons to Esau, by Reuel. Their names agree with Genesis in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint, except that this last reads <span class="cmt_word">Naches</span> here for Nachoth there.

LIST OF DESCENDANTS OF SEIR. These verses contain the names of seven sons of <span class="cmt_word">Seir</span> and one daughter, and of grandsons through every one of the seven sons, viz. two through <span class="cmt_word">Lotan</span> the first, five through <span class="cmt_word">Shobal</span> the second, two through <span class="cmt_word">Zibeon</span> the third, one through <span class="cmt_word">Anah</span> the fourth, four through <span class="cmt_word">Dishon</span> the fifth, three through <span class="cmt_word">Ezar</span> the sixth, and two through <span class="cmt_word">Dishan</span> the seventh, - twenty-six names in all, or, including the one daughter, who is introduced as <span class="cmt_word">Lotan's</span> <span class="cmt_word">sister</span>, twenty-seven. The first question which arises is, who Seir was, now first mentioned here. He is called in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> "Seir the Horite," and the only previous mention of the name Seir in that chapter is in ver. 8, "Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom;" while we read in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>, "The Horites in mount Self;" in <a href="../../par/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>, "To the land of Seir, the country of Edom." For anything we know of the person Self, then, we are confined to these two notices - that in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> and the one in our text. The name signifies "rough;" and whether Seir. the person, took the name from Seir, the place (a mountain district, reaching from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf), or <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, it would seem plain that the proper name belonged to the head of the tribe, which had become located there, and was, of course, not in the line of Abraham. This tribe, called Horites - Hori being the name of Seir's eldest grandson - or Troglodytes, acquired their name from hollowing out dwellings in the rocks, as at Petra. They were visited evidently by Esau: he married at least one of his wives from them; and his descendants, the Edomites, in due time dispossessed and superseded them (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>). No doubt some were left behind, and contentedly submitted to the Edomites and became mingled with them. These considerations put together account for the introduction here of the names of Seir and his twenty-seven descendants, while the particulars of their genealogy, so far as here given, would lie easily to hand. The sons of Seir are called in Genesis also "dukes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>), a word answered to by the later "sheikhs;" and they are called "dukes of the Horites," or "the dukes of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Self." The twenty-six or twenty-seven names under notice agree in the Authorized Version entirely with those in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20-27</a>, except that for <span class="cmt_word">Homam, Allan, Shephi, Amram,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Jakan</span> here, we have Hemam, Alvan, Shepho, Hemdan, and Akau there. Also in the Hebrew the texts agree in the two places as regards these names, with the same exceptions. But in the Septuagint the names differ much more in the two places. Thus for <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>),<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> here, we have <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span> there. When the name of Anah is reached in Genesis, it is added, "This was that Anah that found the mules [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, more probably 'hot springs,' as the finder of which Anah is supposed to have been called <span class="accented">Beeri</span>] in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon, his father." And again, when Dishon is mentioned as the son of Anah, there is added, "And Aholi-bamah the daughter of Anah." Note is made of her name, no doubt, for the same kind of reason as Timna is mentioned above. Aholibamah (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> "Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite," <a href="../../par/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>) enjoys notice inasmuch as she became the wife of Esau; and Timna, as she became the concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, and thereby the mother of Amalek.

It has hence been asserted far too dogmatically, as by Spinoza, that the Book of Genesis was no work of Moses; or again, that the passage, in the course of some transcription of manuscripts, had found its way from Chronicles, through a marginal note, at last into the text of Genesis (see Kennicott). But these positions are only forced by the assumption that kings must have reigned in Israel before the sentence could have been written, which is an unnecessary assumption. Kings had been promised to Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>), as among his posterity, and had been prophesied of by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). It <span class="accented">may have been</span> that Edom, secure in her kings for generations, had been wont to make her boast of them. in comparison of and in presence of her neighbours, and the remark may have <span class="accented">thence</span> originated. Lastly, it has been correctly pointed out that the structure of the sentence in the original does not at all necessitate the suggestion (of which in the English Version there is confessedly the <span class="accented">appearance</span>), that kings had already been in Israel. At the same time, too great stress must not be laid upon this, for the slight alteration of translation that would suit the time for Genesis, would throw it out again for our text here, and yet the words of the original are identical. These kings are eight in number; the parentage or the land of each is given. It is to be noticed that the line of royalty is not hereditary, and that several dukes, or heads of tribes, or princes of districts, rule under the king. The names, whether of persons or places, agree in the Authorized Version as they occur here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31-39</a>, except that Saul is here spelt <span class="cmt_word">Shaul</span>, and that we have here <span class="cmt_word">Hadad</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Pai</span> for Hadar and Pan there. These two differences are occasioned by the Hebrew text, and are the only differences between the two Hebrew texts, except that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> here is given <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> there, and that the incorrect spelling here of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is found right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>) in Genesis. The superfluous statement, <span class="cmt_word">Hadad</span> died <span class="cmt_word">also</span>, which begins our fifty-first verse, is not found in Genesis. In the Septuagint the variations between the two places are greater, as well as those from the Hebrew text in either place. Thus we <span class="cmt_word">have Asom, Gethaim, Sebla, Roboth, Balaennor, Achobor, Adad,</span> here, for Asom, Getthaim, Samada, Robboth, Ballenon, Achobor, Arad, there. There is also an entire omission here of the name of the wife of the last king, with those of her mother and grandmother, all of which are given in the passage of Genesis, as found in the Hebrew text.

Thus this first chapter contains those genealogical tables which concern the patriarchs from Adam up to Israel, spanning a stretch of some two thousand three hundred years, and embracing also tables of Edom and certain of the descendants of Edom up to the period of kings. The chapter contains not a single instance of a remark that could be described as of a moral, religious, or didactic kind. Yet not a little is to be learnt sometimes, not a little suggested, from omission and solemn silence as well as from speech; no more notable instance of which could perhaps be given, when we take into account time, place, and circumstances, than that already alluded to in the omissions involved in the following of the name of Seth upon that of Adam. The genealogies of this chapter, with their parallels in Genesis, are notable also for standing unique in all the world's writing, and far over all the world's mythology, for retracing the pedigree of the wide family of men, and especially of the now scattered family of the Jew, to its original. From the time of the close of our Chronicle genealogies, supplemented by the earliest of the New Testament, no similarly comprehensive but useful, ambitious but deliberately designed and successfully executed enterprise has been attempted. And as Matthew Henry has well said, since Christ came, the Jews have lost all their genealogies, even the most sacred of them, "the building is reared, the scaffold is removed; the Seed is come, the line that led to him is broken off." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

There we read more particularly that Joab sent word he had taken the "city of waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lower part of the city (where a stream had its source, and no doubt supplied the city with water), which was very likely the key of the whole position,and called upon David to come up and "encamp against the city and take it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the city, or citadel, which stood upon the heights north of the stream. Glimpses of this kind may suffice to convince us how rapidly a text, really correct, would melt away for us a very large proportion of the whole number of the lesser obstacles which often impede our path in the historical books of the Old Testament.

Tim punishment of Ammou for the treatment of David's well-intended embassy of condolence is now about to be completed. The familiar root of Rabbah signifies multitudinous number, and, resulting thence, the greatness of importance. It was the chief city of the Ammonites, if not their only city of importance enough for mention. In five passages its connection with Ammon is coupled with its name (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>), "Rabbah of the children of Ammon." It has been conjectured to be the <span class="accented">Ham</span> of the Zuzim, or the Ashteroth Karnaim of the Rephaim (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>), of which latter theory there is some interesting evidence of a corroborating tendency at all events (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:985). Rabbah is the proper spelling of the word, except when in a constructive state, as in the above phrase. The relations of Moab and Ammon with Israel are full of interest. After the overthrow of Og, King of Bashan (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>), "Moab and Ammon still remained independent allies south and cast of the Israelite settlements. Both fell before David  - Moab, evidently the weaker, first; Ammon not without a long resistance, which made the siege and fall of its capital, Rabbah-ammon, the crowning act of David's conquests. The ruins which now adorn the 'royal city' are of a later Roman date; but the commanding position of the citadel remains; and the unusual sight of a living stream abounding in fish (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-27.htm">2 Samuel 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>) marks the significance of Joab's song of victory, 'I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters'" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 323, edit. 1866). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-2.htm">1 Chronicles 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Found it to weigh a talent of gold</span>. Two difficulties present themselves in this verse, viz. the reported weight of this crown, and the uncertainty as to what head it was from which David took it. Whatever was its weight, if David's head was able to sustain it for a minute or two, the head of the King of the Ammonites might also occasionally have borne it. Yet it would scarcely be likely that the King of the Ammonites would have so ponderous a crown (calculated at a weight of a hundred and fourteen pounds Troy, or a little more or less than one hundredweight) as one of ordinary wear, or that he would have one of extraordinary wear on his head precisely at such a juncture. Both of these difficulties will remove if we suppose that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, instead of meaning <span class="cmt_word">their king</span>, is the name of the Ammonitish and Moabitish idol (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> Moloch), and which we find (Authorized Version) in <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably (though not Authorized Version) in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>, and <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>.

Probably it is nowhere else used in the sense of "cutting," if it is here. Its ordinary sense is to rule or put into subjection. The parallel place (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) corrects, in the word (Authorized Version) <span class="accented">axes</span>, our Hebrew text, which repeats the word for saw, though putting it in the plural, and which thereby shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This last word means "Axes" or "scythes," and is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;</span>, to cut (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a>). It is found only in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, though it should appear here also. There is a fourth severity of punishment mentioned in the parallel place, that the people were "made to pass through the brick-kilns," a form of torture possibly suggested by the own familiar cruelty of the Ammonites in "making their children to pass through the fire to Moloch." However, in harmony with what is above said respecting the doubtfulness of the just signification of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, much uncertainty hangs over the interpretation of this verse. Instead of severity and needless cruelty on the part of David, it may rather set forth that he <span class="accented">subjected</span> them to hard tasks in connection with the cultivation of the soil and with the making of bricks. The saws and harrows and axes (or scythes) were awkward and unlikely weapons to be employed for the purpose of inflicting torture, when the ordinary weapons of battle and warfare were close at hand. This view, however, is contrary to the verdict, so far as the above Hebrew verb is concerned, of Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' p. 1326, and of Thenins, on this and the parallel passage. When such punishments were of the nature of torture, the cruelty was in some cases extreme. "The criminal was sometimes sawn asunder lengthwise; this was more especially the practice in Persia. Isaiah, according to the Talmud-isis, was put to death in this wise by King Manasseh, 'Sanhedrin,' p. 103, c. 2; comp. Justin's dialogue with Trypho" (Jahn's 'Sacred Antiquities,' p. 132, &sect; 260, 7.). <span class="accented">With saws.</span> The word in the original is not in the plural. It occurs again only in the parallel place (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-9.htm">1 Kings 7:9</a>, both times in the singular. The teeth of Eastern saws then and now usually incline to the handle instead of from it. With harrows of iron. The only <span class="accented">harrow</span> known to have been used at this time consisted of a thick block of wood borne down by a weight, or on which a man sat, drawn over the ploughed land by oxen (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>), and the root of the Hebrew word expresses the idea of crushing or levelling the land. But our present word is very different, and is found only here and in the parallel place, with the word "iron" accompanying it, so as to be equivalent to a compound word, and appears to mean "sharp instruments of iron," or sharp threshing instruments. The use of the former part of this phrase (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>) for <span class="accented">cheeses</span> is the only other instance of its occurrence. <span class="accented">Saws</span> should be "axes," or "scythes," as stated above, though it is not any of the three more ordinary words for "axe" (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142).

Still this, it may justly be argued, may have been the very reason of the form of expression here chosen, coupling David's work and that of his servants. This brief summary in the last verse of this chapter, as also in the last verse of the corresponding chapter, just serves to reveal to us the nexus that bound together the three or four exploits for narration.

Our own passage seems to confine the temptation and sin to David. David also seems to be spoken of as the object of malignant attack on the part of Satan, though Israel is spoken of as the object of malignant envy and animosity. It is also to be noticed that in ver. 17 David takes all the blame to himself, and speaks of the people as "innocent sheep." A people and whole nation have, indeed, often suffered the smart of one ruler's sin. Yet here the light thrown upon the whole event by the account in the Book of Samuel must be accepted as revealing the fact that there had been previously something amiss on the part of the people - perhaps something of illest significance lurking in their constitution. This alone could "kindle the anger of the Lord against Israel." It is the opposite of this which kindles the anger of Satan - when he witnesses excellence, surpassing excellence, as when he witnesses "the <span class="accented">weakest</span> saint," yet in that strongest position," <span class="accented">on his knees."</span> The apparent inconsistency in Satan being spoken of as resisting Israel, and the anger of the Lord being spoken of as kindled against Israel, is but apparent and superficial. In the first place, these histories do only purport to state the facts <span class="accented">overt.</span> And in this sense either alternative statement gives the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> facts. Either is true, and both may be true in different chronological order. And further, that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel is no disproof that Satan will see and seize his opportunity. It looks the contrary way. There was a time and an occasion in Eden when Satan thought he saw an opportunity, tried it, and found it, when the anger of the Lord was <span class="accented">not</span> kindled against Adam and Eve for certain. But much more prompt will be the <span class="accented">executive</span> of Satan at another and less doubtful time. The paths in written history are often awhile rugged and broken up; the written history of Scripture is no exception. And in thus being the more in analogy with history <span class="accented">itself</span>, those unevennesses and breaks are the better attestation of both the reality of the Scripture history and the veracity of its writers. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) occurs twenty-four times in the Old Testament. On all occasions of its occurrence in the Book of Job and in the prophecies of Zechariah, it shows the prefixed definite article; in all other places it is, with the present passage, unaccompanied by the article. Its translation here might appear strictly as that of a proper name. But this cannot be said of the other instances of its use, when without the article (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>). This constitutes with some the ground of the very opposite opinion and opposite translation. If we regard the name as utterly expressing the personality of Satan, the passage is very noteworthy, and will be most safely regarded as the language of the compiler, and not as copied from the original source. The signification of the word "Satan," as is well known, is "adversary," or "accuser." The sin of David in giving the order of this verse was of a technical and ceremonial character, in the first place, whatever his motives were, and however intensified by other causes of a moral and more individual complexion. We learn (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>) the special enactments respecting what was to be observed when "the sum of the children of Israel after their number" was to be taken. However, the same passage does not say, it fails to say, when such a numbering would be legitimate or when not. It is left us, therefore, to deduce this from observation. And we notice, in the first place, that, on the occasion of its undoubted rightness, it is the work of the distinct commandment of God (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1-4</a>). Next, we notice the religious contribution, "the ransom," that was required with it (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-48.htm">Numbers 31:48-54</a>). Again, we notice that the numberings narrated both in the beginning of the Book of Numbers (1.) and toward the close (26.) had specific moral objects as assigned by God - among them the forcible teaching of the loss entailed by the successive rebellions of the people (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-64.htm">Numbers 26:64, 65</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14, 15</a>). And though last, not least, all these indications are lighted up by the express and emphatic announcements in God's original promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their seed should become <span class="accented">past</span> numbering, multitudinous as the stars, and as the sands of the seashore. From all which we may conclude that only <span class="accented">that</span> numbering was held legitimate which was for God's service in some form, and as <span class="accented">against</span> human pride and boastfulness - by God's command as against a human king's fancy - and which was attended by the payment of that solemn "ransom" money, the <span class="accented">bekah</span>, or half-shekel (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>). Other numbering had snares about it, and it was no doubt because it had such <span class="accented">intrinsically</span> that it was divinely discountenanced, and in this case severely punished. It seems gratuitous with some to tax David with having other motives than those of some sort of vanity now at work, sinister designs of preparing, unaided and unpermitted, some fresh military exploits, or stealing a march on the nation itself in the matter of some new system of taxation. The context offers no corroboration of either of these notions, while several lesser indications point to the simplest explanation (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the rulers of the people</span>. So <a href="../../par/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a>, "And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers" (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-3.htm">1 Chronicles 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be</i>: but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants?</span> The place of this perfectly intelligible sentence, indicating that Joab discerned the object of David in desiring the numbering of the people, is occupied in the Book of Samuel by the words, "And that the eyes of my lord the king may see it;" which some for no very evident reason prefer. It was, no doubt, a very radical element of David's sin in this matter that he was thinking of the nation too much as <span class="accented">his</span> own servants, instead of as the servants of his one Master. The Lord ever knoweth who are his, and numbereth not only them and their names, but their every sigh, tear, prayer. <span class="cmt_word">A cause of trespass</span>. This clause may be explained as though <span class="accented">trespass</span> was equivalent to the consequences, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the punishment of trespass. This. however, rather tends to explain away than to explain a phrase. More probably the deeper meaning is that, in the fact of the numbering, nation and king would become one in act, and would become involved together in indisputable sin. Though there were no unfeigned assent and consent in the great body of the nation to the numbering, yet they would become participators in the wrong-doing. It would further seem evident, from Joab addressing these words to the king, that it was a thing familiarly known and thoroughly understood that the course David was now bent on following was one virtually, if not actually, prohibited, and not one merely <span class="accented">likely</span> to be displeasing to God on account of any individual disposition in David to be boastful or self-confident. Otherwise it would be scarcely within the province of Joab either to express or suppose this of his royal master. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-4.htm">1 Chronicles 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab.

This short verse stands in the place of all the five verses of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4-8</a>, with their interesting contents, giving the route which Joab and his assistants took, and the time occupied (nine months and twenty days) to their return. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.

Here they are three hundred thousand more for Israel, and thirty thousand fewer for Judah, than there. No really satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies has yet appeared. The somewhat ingenious suggestion that the Chronicle-compiler counted in the standing army (two hundred and eighty-eight thousand, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>) for Israel, and omitted from Judah a supposed "thirty thousand," under the head of "the thirty" of our ch. 11; while the writer of the Book of Samuel did exactly the converse, - can scarcely pass muster, although it must be noticed that it would meet in the main the exigencies of the case. A likelier suggestion might be found in a comparison of the statements of our ver. 6 compared with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22-24</a>. Indeed, the last sentence of this last-quoted verse (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>) may possibly contain the explanation of all (cutup. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47-50</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-33.htm">Numbers 2:33</a>). That Joab utterly refused to number Levi, because this was a thing most distinctly prohibited (and further because it was not material to David's presumable objects), was quite to be expected. And though Joab is said in the following verse not to have numbered Benjamin, it is possible enough that he may have known this number (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-11</a>). Yet see what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Averse to his task as Joab was, he may have been indebted to the memory of the exemption of Levi from census for the idea of enlarging upon it and omitting Benjamin as well. The important contents of this short verse are not found in Samuel, so that we can borrow no light thence. But Benjamin was "the least of the tribes" (<a href="../../par/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1-23</a>), and Peele has suggested that God would not permit the numbers of either of these tribes to be lessened, as he foresaw that they would be faithful to the throne of David on the division of the kingdom. Others think that the omission of these tribes in the census may have been due to Joab's recall to Jerusalem before the completion of the work, and to the king's repentance in the interim cutting off the necessity of completing it. This little agrees, however, with the resolute tone and assigned reason contained in this verse. Peele's explanation, meantime, explains nothing in respect of the statement that <span class="cmt_word">the king's word was abominable to Joab.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a></div><div class="verse">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smote Israel</span>. These two words serve simply to summarize in the first instance what the compiler is about to rehearse at greater length. The parallel place shows, "And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people." Some better power occasioned that smiting. Reflection brought to David's heart and conscience (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>), as often to those of others, restored vitality. The exact circumstances or providences, however, which roused into action the conscience of David are not stated. The second clause of our verse cannot refer to any preliminary smiting, but to the oncoming visitation of pestilence. It is noticeable, if only as a coincidence, that the eleventh verse of the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>) opens with a similarly ambiguously placed clause, "For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet Gad," although this is explainable simply as our insufficient Authorized Version rendering. However, failing any external cause, the beginning of ver. 10 in this same parallel place may intimate the adequate account of all in the <span class="accented">spontaneous</span> stirring of David's conscience" the bitter thoughts of conscience born." In these two verses we suddenly come upon the name "God" instead of "the Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah.

In this last passage our Authorized Version translates "prophet" while in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a> our Authorized Version translates both Hebrew names in the very same verse by the one English word "seer."

The parallel place shows no mention of the destroying angel here spoken cf.

This sentence is followed in the parallel place by "from the morning even to the time appointed." It has been suggested that "the time appointed" may mean the time of the evening sacrifice, and that God shortened thus the three days to a short one day. There seems nothing sufficient to support the suggestion, unless it might lie in the "repenting" of the Lord, and his "staying" of the angel's hand, in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">There fell of Israel seventy thousand men</span>.

The verb "stood" is employed here quite generically. It does not imply that the angel stood on the ground; for see next verse, in which it is said that he "stood between the earth and the heaven," the Hebrew verb being exactly the same. <span class="accented">Ornan is</span> the uniform form and spelling of the name in Chronicles. In Samuel, however, the name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a>), or <span class="accented">Araunah.</span> Yet in ver. 16, of the same chapter the Kethiv inverts the order of the <span class="accented">resh</span> and <span class="accented">vau</span>, prefixing the article, or what looks like it, and again in ver. 18 the Kethiv shows the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Ornan, then, or Arauuah, was a descendant of the old Jebusite race to whom the fort of Zion once belonged. And the present narrative finds him living on the Hill of Moriah (Conder's' Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., 236 [6]). <span class="accented">The threshing-floor.</span> The primitive threshing-floors of the Israelites still essentially obtain. They were level spots of stamped and well-trodden earth, about fifty feet in diameter, and selected in positions most exposed to the wind, in order to take the advantage of its help in the separating of the grain from the chaff. On these circular spots of hard earth the sheaves of grain, of whatever kind, were distributed in all sorts of disorder. Oxen and other cattle trod them. And sometimes these beasts were driven round and round five abreast. The stalk of the grain was, of course, much bruised and crushed, and the method is described still as of a very rough and wasteful kind. Instruments were also employed, as the "flail" (<a href="../../par/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27, 28</a>); the "sledge," to which possibly reference is made in <a href="../../par/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7, 16</a>, under the name <span class="accented">barkanim</span> (Authorized Version, "briers").

Ornan's prompt offer of gift was, perhaps, all the prompter from the desire to render every assistance to the staying of the plague. <span class="cmt_word">For burnt offerings ...  for the meat offering.</span> The whole code of regulations for offerings - sin offering, trespass offering, peace offering, burnt offering, meat and drink offering - is to be found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>. As regards the <span class="accented">burnt offering</span>, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8-13</a>. It was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from its "ascending" accepted to heaven, or else from its being put up or raised up (Hiph. conjugation) on the altar; and sometimes <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, from being "wholly" consumed. The sin and trespass offerings were for special sins, but this was of a more comprehensive kind and of much greater dignity, as standing for the "purging of the conscience." The entire consuming of the sacrifice signified the unqualified self-surrender of him who brought the sacrifice. It was a voluntary offering, the offerer laid his hand on the head of the victim, and the blood of the victim was sprinkled round about the altar. <span class="accented">The meat offering</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is fully described in Leviticus it.; Leviticus 6:14-23. It was an offering without blood, and therefore was an accompaniment of an offering of blood. It was composed of flour or cakes, prepared with salt, oil, and frank-incense - the salt emblematic of non-decay; the oil, of spiritual grace; and the frankincense, of acceptable fragrance. A portion of this offering was to be burnt, and a portion eaten by the priests in the court, unless it was for a priest himself, when all must be burnt. Meantime a drink offering of wine was, in fact, a part of the meat offering itself (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4-7, 9, 10</a>). The material of the meat offering might be the green or fresh-gathered ears of corn. The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Luther, <span class="accented">speis-opfer</span>; and it need scarcely be said that our Authorized Version <span class="accented">meat</span> offering exhibits only the generic employment of the word "meat" for food.

The extraordinary and impressive designating of this spot was in itself a signal for an active commencement of the work, and made at the same time such commencement practicable. Solomon and many others would afterwards often think, often speak, of the "threshing-finer of Ornan the Jebusite" as the place "which was shown to David his father," and which "David had prepared" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>).

It is impossible to fix the exact age of Solomon as marked by these words. In a "fragment" of Eupolemus (see Cory's 'Ancient Fragments of the Phoenician,' etc., Writers,' edit.

It seems remarkable that no previous statement of this objection, nor even allusion to it, is found.

Yet, if it seem impossible to resist the impression that it must have found expression on the occasion referred to in those two passages, we may fit it in best between vers. 10 and 11 of the former reference, and between vers. 11 and 12 of the latter.

The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Luther's translation adopt here our marginal reading, "poverty." Keil, Bertheau, and others translate, with much greater probability, "by severe effort," which translation may be fortified, not only by such references as <a href="../../par/genesis/31-43.htm">Genesis 31:43</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1</a> (where the same root is found in Pual infinitive), but by the expression evidently answering to the present one in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;</span>), "with all my strength." Moreover, David could not with correctness speak of poverty as characterizing his condition during the time that he had been collecting for the object of his heart's desire. And scarcely with any greater correctness could he speak of the necessary anxieties and responsibilities of his royal office as at all specially marking this period. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver</span>. Our sense of dissatisfaction in being able neither heartily to accept nor conclusively to reject this statement of the quantities of gold and silver prepared by David, may be lessened in some degree by the statement found in ver. 16, that "of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number." Milman, in his 'History of the Jews' (1. 266, 267, edit. 1830), says upon the general subject of this verse, "But enormous as this wealth (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of Solomon) appears, the statement of his expenditure on the temple, and of his annual revenue, so passes all credibility, that any attempt at forming a calculation, on the uncertain data we possess, may at once be abandoned as a hopeless task. No better proof can be given of the uncertainty of our authorities, of our imperfect knowledge of the Hebrew weights of money, and, above all, of our total ignorance of the relative value which the precious metals bore to the commodities of life, than the estimate made by Dr. Prideaux of the treasures left by David, amounting to eight hundred millions, nearly the capital of our national debt." It must be noted, however, that Milman himself proceeds, when speaking of "the <span class="accented">sources</span> of the vast wealth which Solomon undoubtedly possessed," to bring very enormous sums (whether somewhat less or even somewhat more than the above estimate of Dr. Prideaux) more within the range of the possible, to our imagination. He justly remarks, for instance, that it is to be remembered that "the treasures of David were accumulated rather by conquest than traffic, that some of the nations he subdued, particularly the Edomites, were very wealthy. All the tribes seem to have worn a great deal of gold and silver, both in their ornaments and in their armour; their idols were often of gold; and the treasuries of their temples, perhaps, contained considerable wealth. But during the reign of Solomon, <span class="accented">almost the whole commerce of the world</span> passed into his territories." After substantiating by details these and similar positions (pp. 267-271), he sums up, "It was from these various sources of wealth that the precious metals and all other valuable commodities were in such abundance that, in the figurative language of the sacred historian, '<span class="accented">silver was in Jerusalem as stones</span>, <span class="accented">and cedar trees as sycamores.</span>" Since the date of Milman's words just quoted, however, investigation of ancient weights and measures, and of those of Scripture, has made some advance, yet not sufficient to enable us to arrive at any certainty as to those of our present passage. Assuming that the text of our present verse is not corrupt, and that the figures which it gives are correct, the weight and the value of the gold and silver mentioned are very great, whatever the talent in question. This assumption, however, cannot be relied upon, and it seems scarcely legitimate to interpret the talent as any than the Hebrew talent, considering the silence observed as regards any other. It need not be said here that the exchanges of money value were estimated in these times by so much weight of gold or silver. Further, "the shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-3.htm">Leviticus 27:3</a>), possibly the same with "the shekel after the king's weight" (2 Samuel 16:26), and which was kept in the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple - was presumably the standard. The gold talent was double the <span class="accented">weight</span> of the silver talent. It weighed 1,320,000 grains, instead of 660,000. The silver talent contained 50 manehs, of 60 shekels each; but the gold talent contained 100 manehs, of 100 shekels each. The modern money equivalents of these weights are very uncertain. Both the silver and the gold talent have been very variously calculated in this relation. Some of the best authorities put the silver talent at &pound;342 3s. 9d., and the gold at &pound;5475. This would make the money value described by this verse nearly nine hundred millions of our money. Other estimates are considerably in excess of this sum, and but few fall below it. Vast as the sum is, we may be helped in some degree to accept it by the statement of Pliny, who ('Nat. Hist.,' 32:15) tells us that Cyrus, in his subjugation of Asia, took half as many talents of silver as are here mentioned, and thirty-four thousand pounds of gold (see articles in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' on "Money," and on" Weights and Measures"). Among the most valuable works on these subjects are De Saulcy's 'Numismatique Judaique,' and F. Madden's 'Jewish Coinage.'

And now at last it is given to the lip of the aged David to pronounce the termination of a nation's prolonged conflict, its entrance into peace, and the fulfilment of the most impassioned wishes, ima-ginings, end prayers of the patriarchs, of Moses, and of a long line of the faithful. It was well for David that he could not foresee and did not know how near the culminating of a nation's glory and prosperity might be to its woeful fall and prolonged decay. The analogy that obtains in this respect between the history of an individual and of a nation is as remarkable as it should be instructive and turned to the uses of warning.

These words give the key note of what remains in this book. David made his son king, as he himself acknowledges (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), under the superintending direction of God. The manner in which the formal event was precipitated by the conduct of Adonijah is found at length in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>. The original occasion alluded to there more than once, on which David promised, "and sware" to Bathsheba, that her son should be his chief heir and successor to the throne, is not distinctly recorded. We can easily assign one convenient place in the history for it to have found monition, viz. in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>. The brevity of the statement which composes this verse, when compared with all the deeply interesting matter recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>, is one among many other very clear illustrations of the purposed silence of our present history in certain directions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-2.htm">1 Chronicles 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span> As on an occasion of supreme importance, David, in view of his own death and of his son's succession at the present time, calls together the full council, and the highest possible representative council of the nation. So <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>; in which last passage the word "captains" should have have been rendered "princes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The arrangement of the Levites, and the distribution of their functions in the presence of the princes, as here described, and as it is even more strongly put (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>), "by" them, simply points to the fact that the ultimate outer authority, as between Church and state, lay with the state. The Church was made for it, not it for the Church. And it was the duty of the state to defend the Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward.</span> The thing which Joab had rightly resisted (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-3.htm">1 Chronicles 21:3-6</a>) and shrunk from doing was now rightly done. There was now a practical and a legitimate object for doing it. This consideration helps to determine what it was that "displeased the Lord" in the former general census of David. In connection with this clause, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a> should be noted, where we read, "But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens." The period from the age of thirty years up to fifty (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 23, 35, 39</a>) was fixed under Moses, for those "that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation" (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). It is not certain, however, that this census did not inquire, in point of fact, respecting some below this limit of age. For we may note ver. 24 in the first place, and this is partly explained by <a href="../../par/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-25</a>. The number "thirty and eight thousand" of our present verse may be compared with the "eight thousand and five hundred and four score" of <a href="../../par/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47, 48</a>. It is to be observed how promptly the national council did on this occasion commence with the arrangement of the ministers of religion, "the Levites." As we read (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>) of "thirty years" of age as the appointed age for the commencement of their ministry, and (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>) of the present or "offering" of "six covered waggons and twelve oxen," which the twelve "princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, princes of the tribes," offered "before the Lord," which greatly lessened the laborious work of the Levites; so we find the commencing age reduced from time to time, to "twenty-five" years (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), and to "twenty years" of age, as in our present chapter (vers. 24-28). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">Of which, twenty and four thousand <i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To set forward</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, Piel conjugation).

The explanation of the nature of the work of these, as really outward work, for the "outward business of Israel," is distinctly stated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5-11</a>. These <span class="accented">officers</span> are mentioned under the same Hebrew term in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>, in a very different connection. It is plain that they were generally foremen, or overseers; while the <span class="accented">judges</span> took cognizance of matters which involved the interests of religion. This verse and the following give between them the <span class="accented">four</span> divisions of Levites, afterwards to be more fully described. The fuller account of the "twenty-four thousand" priests (including attendants) occupies ch. 24; the "six thousand" officers and judges, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20-32</a>; the "four thousand" porters, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-19</a>; and the "four thousand who praised the Lord with the instruments," ch. 25.

There is no connection between either the word or idea we have here, and those of <a href="../../par/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>, where the Hithp. conjugation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5e4;</span> is used, and the sense of residence probably intended to be conveyed. <span class="cmt_word">The instruments which I made...  to praise</span>. Possibly the quotation of a short sentence often on David's lips. Men given to music may have been very conscious of it, in ancient days, as well as in modern. The language, however, does not necessarily assert that David claimed the inventing or in any similar sense the <span class="accented">making</span> of these musical instruments, but that he <span class="accented">appointed</span> them for the service of praise. What some of them were may be seen in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> - "cymbals, psalteries, harps, trumpets" (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>).

The duties of the priest are described as threefold, in this place, viz.: "to burn incense before the Lord," - this will carry the idea of making atonement; "to minister to God," on behalf of man, ? this will be one part of the work of a mediator; and "to bless in the Name of God,"  - this will fulfil the remaining part.

Yet it would seem far more natural to explain this last-quoted passage by our ver. 23, which would then parallel it. Otherwise we must account for the name of Mahli habitually standing first, as here, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-19.htm">1 Chronicles 6:19</a> also, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26</a>, as also in <a href="../../par/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20, 33</a>, etc.; in all of which places the statement is as distinct as in this verse, that Mahli and Mushi were sons.

It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the "thirty" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with "David's last words" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number "thirty" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David.

The "for" of this clause cannot be supposed to account exclusively for the inclusion in the census of Levites beginning from the age of twenty years; it accounts no doubt for the whole proceeding. Since there would be no more journeyings for people, for buildings, or for sacred vessels, it was nosy fully time to organize religious duty and "the service of the house of God" in a manner adapted to permanent institutions. In order to this, the first step was to know and to arrange the number of those who were answerable for sacred duties.

Keil supposes there may be no distinction between them, but adds that if there is, he would take the "princes of God" to stand for the regular high priests exclusively, viz. those who could enter into the most holy place before God. The "princes of God" is a title evidently illustrated by the word "Israel" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).

The evident and easy correction of the first occurrence of which into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> (one) will make the clause and sense correspond with what goes before. Bertheau, however, and Keil, and some others do not accept this correction, and would keep the present Hebrew text, the first-named, moreover, contending that the repetition of the word for "taking" points to two lots being represented by each house of Ithamar, whose total number was only eight, for one of Eleazar, whose total was sixteen. Not only does the repetition of the present Hebrew text not avail to authorize such a supposition, but the supposition itself would be unsupported and gratuitous. What is really told us amounts to this only, that the drawing was first from the collection of families under the name of Eleazar, and then from that descended from Ithamar. For anything we are here told, the urn of Ithamar can have held out only half as long as that of Eleazar, and it can be only conjecture to suppose that two lots were drawn from the urn of Eleazar for every one from that of Ithamar, so as to make them run out together at the end. Could any one of the names from sixteen to twenty-four that are recorded in this chapter as "coming forth" in the shape of a "lot," be identified as belonging to families descended from Ithamar, the question might be solved. <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>; read, as above, ver. 3, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, etc., <span class="accented">Abiathar the son of Abimelech.</span>

An interesting allusion to this order of courses is tacitly made in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>, where the twenty-fifth idolater may be supposed to be the high priest. Some have, on very insufficient grounds, supposed that this "ordering" of courses was not really the institution of David, but attributed to him after the Exile for the sake of the authority of his name. In <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for. In addition to the direct scriptural witness on this subject, Josephus's ('Ant.,' 7:14) testimony confirms the account of our present chapter, while Movers (in 'Chronik.,' 279) and Dehler (in Herzog's 'R.E.,' 12:185) effectively combat the positions of De Wette and Gramberg, and of Herzberg, in his 'History of the People of Israel.'

These, of course, do not exhaust the whole of the non-priestly Levites; for we read distinctly in the following two chapters of other detachments of the non-priestly Levites, whose office was as singers, doorkeepers, and treasure-keepers. And this consideration may of itself possibly be a sufficient account of the absence of any of the family of Gershonites in the list of the present chapter, though they do appear to view for other work in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-21.htm">1 Chronicles 26:21</a>, etc. Amram...

The latter of these two names marks the line of Moses, in his eider son, Gershon, whose son was Shebuel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-15.htm">1 Chronicles 23:15, 16</a>), as the former is the name of the father of Moses, and <span class="accented">eldest</span> son of Kohath.

This Jahath furnishes for us the third name of this series of "other sons of Levi." And Keil plausibly argues, from the absence of these three names from the list of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6, 23</a>, that, while that list is occupied with fathers' houses, this list is occupied with the official classes of the Levites who were to be engaged in the way already stated.

The elder of these, <span class="accented">Mahli</span>, as already seen in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-21.htm">1 Chronicles 23:21, 22</a>, had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, the sons of the latter of whom took the daughters of Eleazar, who had no sons, and thus kept only one house surviving, the head of which was (ver. 29) <span class="cmt_word">Jerahmeel</span>. This would seem to complete all that needs to be said of the Mahli line. Meantime, however, we are confronted by the contents of the latter half of our ver. 26 and ver. 27. These purport to give, amid some confusion of expression, sons of <span class="cmt_word">Merari by Jaaziah his son</span> (<span class="accented">Beno</span>). No anterior authority, however, can be found for this <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>. Neither of him nor of any of the three names (omitting <span class="accented">Beno</span>, which is evidently to be translated "his son") here linked on to his, is anything known. While we accept the text as it at present is, we have an additional branch with three families to add to the account of Merari - the branch of <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>, the three families of <span class="cmt_word">Shoham</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Zaeeur, Ibri</span>. Even so we have in ver. 27 to obliterate arbitrarily the conjunction <span class="accented">van</span>, prefixed to the name Shoham. Under these circumstances, Keil impatiently rejects these clauses altogether, as an interpolation, though one of which he can give no account, and adds up, in consequence, the families of Levi (exclusive of the priests) to twenty-two instead of the unexplained twenty-five of the present text. On the other hand, Bertheau retains the present reading, and accepts Jaaziah as a third branch of the family of Merari. If this were so, it is surprising that nowhere else is room found for the slightest mention of Jaaziah, nor any other mention of these supposed descendants.

It is to be observed that, in the foregoing verses, we have no expressed sum of the families or heads to which they add up. Hence Bertheau finds twenty-five in all, which he would reduce to the twenty-four he wants by omitting, without any adequate justificacation, the Mahli of ver. 30. Others, omitting the three names of Shoham, Zaccur, Ibri, bring the twenty-five to twenty-two. Keil finds only fifteen "heads" or "classes," but surmises that the Hebronite and Mushite "fathers' houses" may have been numerous enough to find more than one "class;" and thereby to make up the twenty-four classes which he desires as well for symmetry's sake as for the patent suggestions of ver. 31.

There can be no doubt at all that it contains no allusion whatever to the horn as an instrument of sound (the almost solitary approach to which use of the word is found in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), but that it falls in with the very frequent <span class="accented">figurative</span> use of the phrase as it occurs in the very same words (<a href="../../par/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>, etc.), and which means "to add to the strength" or "honour" of any one. The allusion is to the number of Heman's children being a mark of the honour God set on him.

Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable.

These two classes will surely satisfy the "teacher and the scholar" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the "scholar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) and the "teacher" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of "sons" and "brethren." The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the "four thousand" of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here.

It has been supposed that this is a mere omission of carelessness. But this can scarcely be asserted conclusively. It is observable, for instance, that the order of the formula in the same verse, on occasion of its very first occurrence, is not identical with the other twenty-two instances of it, the word "brethren" preceding "sons," and the pronoun "he" being expressed. The preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>) is sometimes expressed and sometimes not expressed before both the proper names and the ordinal numerals of the list. Examination of the contents of these verses shows, either that it was due to the Divine direction of the lot (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>) that an issue resulted which looks so unlike mere chance, and the system of which is so methodical and traceable; or that the lot-taking was not one of families and sons, all thrown together from the first. This supposition would, of course, leave room for some such ingenious hypothesis as that of Berthean, too artificial by far to be defensible except as a theory that would indeed work out the result. He suggests that the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> was by two urns, one for the first seven odd numbers, into which were put the names of Asaph's four sons and of the second, third, and fourth of Heman; the other for the first seven even numbers, into which were put the six sons of Jeduthun and the first of Heman. Turning from such a concocted theory to these verses, we find that the first cast brings to the surface the <span class="accented">second</span> son of Asaph, and the second cast brings up the eldest son of Jeduthun. At the end of the seventh all of Asaph's sons are exhausted, and what would have been his next place (the ninth) is occupied by the second son of Heman, whose eldest had just taken the sixth place so thrown out by the lot. At the end of the fourteenth throw Jeduthun's six sons are all used up, and all the remaining places belong to Heman's sons, but still in the order in which they are thrown out by the lot.

And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of "four thousand porters," it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the <span class="accented">two hundred and twelve</span> of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>.

At the same time, no little light may be thrown on this subject by noticing that the porters numbered in Zerubbabel's time one <span class="accented">hundred and thirty-nine</span> (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>); and that the number one <span class="accented">hundred and seventy-two</span> is given for them by Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>). The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13</a></div><div class="verse">And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.</div><div class="comm">

A special note is made of the care taken for the house of <span class="cmt_word">Asuppim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of "gatherings" or "stores." For all that we know of this "house," we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>), "the storehouses, or stores of the gates" (though the Authorized Version, the "thresholds" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, "the gates of the stores." Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">seniorum concilium. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To Shuppim</span>. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12, 15</a>) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding "Asuppim." But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of <span class="accented">Asuppim</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "gatherings for stores." <span class="cmt_word">Shallecheth</span>. By derivation, this word means "sending or throwing down." Hence some call it, "the refuse gate." The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the <span class="cmt_word">causeway of the going up</span>, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>); and Grove would identify the "gate of Shallecheth" with the present <span class="accented">Bab Silsileh.</span> The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Shallecheth.</span> The Septuagint then mutts the following word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Ward against ward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. watch with watch.</span> The expression up- pears to refer to the fact that Hosah's lot threw to him the charge of a double position.

These words, with forms akin to them, are often found in the Targums, but not elsewhere in the Scriptures. The nearest approach to the meaning of the word, as yet discovered, is a "suburb." The connection may just do as much as indicate that, whereas four porters kept the causeway gate, the Parbar gate was in closer proximity to the temple that was to be, but what this Parbar really was is not yet ascertained. Possibly it is the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of Josephus ('Ant.,' 15. 11:5).

This, however, in fact, tallies with the clause "respecting their number" in the first verse, and may constitute the explanation of the apparent inconsistency in question. Milman ('Hist. of the Jews,' 1:251, edit. 1830) says on this military portion of David's preparations, that he "organized an immense disposable force; every month twenty-four thousand men, furnished in rotation by the tribes, appeared in arms, and were trained as the standing militia of the country. At the head of his army were officers of consummate experience and, what was more highly esteemed in the warfare of the time, extraordinary personal activity, strength, and valour.

Kennicott ('Dies.,' 72, 82) confirms this supposition by noting that the Book of Samuel constantly replaces by the definite article what appears in Chronicles as "son of." He has also shown reason for believing that the words in this passage, "that sat in the seat, are a corruption of the Hebrew text for characters that would spell our name "Jashobeam." We know nothing of this name "Hachmon," which may be the name of an earlier forefather, while <span class="cmt_word">Zabdiel</span>, thence named "the Hach-monite," appears to Be the name of the actual father of Jashobeam.

Eunuchs are never mentioned elsewhere in David's reign. There is no reason to suppose the word means "eunuch," for instance, in <a href="../../par/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>.

Although there are not very many instances of this use of the word "know," its antiquity and classical character may be considered guaranteed by such passages as <a href="../../par/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. The expression, "the God of thy father," evidently intended to be touching, is more fully given in ver. 20, "God, even my God, will be with thee," which in its turn reminds us of Paul's language, "But my God shall supply all your need" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The urgent entreaty on the part of David breathes in every sentence of it, thought, and a mode of presentation of it, feeling, and depth of conviction, with which we are familiar in his psalms. He speaks from his own varied, remarkable, and rich experience of the Divine care and jealous love, and from much personal experience of the deceitfulness of the heart, to Solomon, into whom, were it possible, he would pour the advantage of all he had learned, and from whom he would hide nothing of his intense and anxious solicitude. To the same strain he returns in ver. 20, but there with more exclusive reference to the undertaking of the building of "the house of the Lord," or the <span class="cmt_word">house for the sanctuary</span>. One thing only fails, perhaps, to be made quite apparent from the language of David, viz. why he deemed it necessary to urge so strenuously on Solomon the enterprise of building the temple and of carrying it to completion. With abundance of means and preparations so large already made, one might have supposed a young king and a young man would have needed little pressure and little exhortation. Nevertheless, in the manifest presence of David's words, it is very far from impossible to suppose the dangers and temptations of Solomon's position as constituting a serious risk.

Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that "David gave" these "patterns to Solomon his son" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, "The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern." Whatever we generally accept respecting the <span class="accented">writing</span> of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree "in the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such "patterns" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">patterns</span> of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">porch</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rang generally, but in this verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is all that appears.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Respecting the uncertainty of the amounts here denoted, even if the numbers of the present text be accepted as correct, see note on 1 Chronicles 22:14. Bertheau and Keil make <span class="cmt_word">three thousand talents of gold</span> the equivalent of thirteen millions and a half of our money, and <span class="cmt_word">seven thousand talents of silver</span> the equivalent of two and a half millions of our money - or, if the royal shekel instead of the sacred be supposed to be the standard, they make them the half of those two amounts respectively. Others calculate the value of the gold to reach thirty millions, and of the silver three millions of our money (see Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 63-65, 81). The situation of Ophir is still considered undetermined. The other occasions on which it is mentioned are as follows: - <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>); <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It must be understood also that it is to it that allusion is made in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>, where we read that silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, beside the gold, were imported into Judaea from it. The "almug" tree is also said to have been brought in the same ships which brought the gold of Ophir. The Septuagint always translates by some form of the word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (except in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>), which word comes very near the Coptic name for India. There is also a place in India, mentioned by Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Abulfeda, the site of the present <span class="accented">emporium</span> of Goa, called <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and which would explain Both the Hebrew and the Septuagint words. An Indian site for Ophir would also well suit the mention of the ivory and the particular wood which the ships brought. On the other hand, the first occasion of this name Ophir finds it placed among the tribes of <span class="accented">Joktan's</span> descendants, who occupied South Arabia. It is there (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>) placed between Sheba and Havilah, beth abounding in gold. There are other considerations that favour Arabia. Many other places have been suggested, and some of them supported by respectable authorities, such as Eastern Africa, South America and Peru, Phrygia, etc. If there be a real question about it, to the prejudice of Arabia, it would be to India we must look. That some of the commodities brought belonged more especially to India, though even in that case the majority belonged undoubtedly to Arabia, is very true. This circumstance throws great probability into the suggestion that whether Ophir were in Arabia or India, it was a great <span class="accented">emporium</span>, and not simply an exporter of its own particular produce (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The last sentence of this verse certainly says that the destined use of the <span class="cmt_word">refined silver</span>, as well as of the <span class="cmt_word">gold of Ophir, was to overlay the walls of the houses</span>. We know that gold was used for this purpose (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5-10</a>). But we do not read of the silver being used for <span class="accented">overlaying</span> purposes. We also read that none of the drinking-vessels of Solomon were of <span class="accented">silver</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> "it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>). It is possible, the order of the-sentences notwithstanding, that the mention of the <span class="accented">refined silver</span> is only to pro-pare the way for the contents of ver. 5, and that it mast not be applied to the last sentence of our present verse.

This does not seem likely, however, because, of course, the <span class="accented">daric</span> itself was not in use in Jerusalem in David's time, and any gold coin that was then in use might have received mention on its own account, even if translated also into the <span class="accented">daric.</span> The Septuagint translates in this verse merely by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">solidos.</span> Under any circumstances, the coin is to be distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>.

It includes adoration, acknowledgment of the inherent nature of human dependence, self-humiliation, and confession, dedication of all the offerings, and prayer both for the whole people in general, and for Solomon in particular, in view of his future position and responsibilities. Its utter repudiation of all idea of meritoriousness is very striking. The traces are visible of what may be called snatches of memory on the part of David from various religious odes of his own authorship, as well as from those of others still on record, as, for instance, especially in vers. 14-17, compared with passages in <a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89, </a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>; and 139. But the unity of this service is abundantly conspicuous, and every sentence seems weighed and measured for the occasion. The scene, reaching its climax in what is recorded in ver. 20, must have been one of the utmost religious grandeur and impressiveness. It is true that the very last clause, which couples the reverence done on the part of the assembled multitude to the king, with that done to Jehovah himself, strikes us as an unfortunate conjunction. It does not, indeed, need upon its merits any vindication, considering the tenor of all which has preceded; but it may be felt an extenuation of the form in which the expression occurs, if we suppose (as we justly may) that the people viewed their act in the light of part of their religious service at that particular time. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a> the same words express the reverence paid to David, though in numerous other passages they mark that offered to God (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>).

The <span class="cmt_word">second time</span> of making Solomon king is explained by <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>. The statement that <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> was anointed to be <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> must probably be understood to describe, either the re-anointing of him (just as "they made Solomon king the second time") on an occasion which particularly invited it; or an anointing which had not been before fully performed. This latter is, perhaps, an unlikely supposition; but at the same time, the fact of any previous ceremony of the kind does not happen to be narrated. Zadok had been joint priest with Abiatbar of the line of Ithamar (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, 29; 19:11); but now he was anointed under circumstances of special publicity, and at a crisis of special interest, to supersede Abiathar. who had sided with Adonijah, and who was early to be removed altogether from the sacred office (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8, 32, 38, 44, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>).

A uniform rendering for all might be found in the general word "history" or "acts." The question as to the probable nature of these works, and whether identical with our Books of Samuel, has been treated of in the Introduction. The Hebrew word for "seer," applied in this verse to Samuel, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. And that applied to Gad, though the Authorized Version has the same translation, "seer," is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. There can be no doubt that the word applied to Samuel would, under any circumstances, stand as the higher of the two names, were there any comparison intended between them. This is confirmed by the fact that it is found used only of him (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9, 11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) and of Hanani (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7, 10</a>), whereas the word applied to Gad in this verse is the <span class="accented">generic</span> name for seers, and is used several times in the Books of Chronicles of other persons than Gad. At the same time, the parenthesis in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, to the effect that the word here used of Samuel as seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) was superseded in later times (as, for instance, at the time of the writing of the Books of Samuel) by the word prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), compared with <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, points in a somewhat different direction. In the first place, it would indicate that our Authorized Version in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> should rather stand, "Which say to the prophets, Prophesy not, and to the seers," etc. While for our present passage it would indicate that no insidious comparison is possible between Samuel and Gad as seers, but rather that Samuel retains the old honoured name by which he had been wont to be called, and that to <span class="accented">Nathan</span> is with equal naturalness attached the more modern name - the functions represented being essentially the same, or at least analogous.

It is the place of <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> which disturbs the fittest order, and Keil suggests that his place in this text is accounted for by Rachel's desire that her handmaid's child should be accounted her own; but surely this was not exceptional, but applied to all or most of such cases, and should have been far rather taken into consideration in any of the other lists than in this.

As this order corresponds with nothing in our Old Testament, it may serve as one slight indication that the compiler of Chronicles was not dependent on these records alone.

Light is thrown upon this by <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, <span class="cmt_word">Abishai</span>, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called <span class="cmt_word">Jether the Ishmeelite</span>, is, in the passage already referred to (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an <span class="accented">Israelite</span>, with little doubt an error for <span class="accented">Ishmaelite.</span> In the same passage also her own name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, though many manuscripts have this latter.

The descendants of <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span> (Chelubai), placed third of Hezron's sons, are next dealt with; but the subject is almost immediately interrupted by resumed reference to <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> (vers. 21-24), and by the table of Jemh-meel and his descendants (vers. 25-41); after which the table of Caleb, apparently the same Caleb, is carried on (vers. 42-49). Taking these broken portions, however, just as they come, we are immediately met by a series of uncertainties and surprises. Ver. 18 is obscure in that it says Caleb had children by <span class="cmt_word">Azubah</span> (the Hebrew construction also unusual), a <span class="cmt_word">wife</span>, or indeed strictly a <span class="accented">woman</span> (not even using the ordinary formula "his wife"), and by <span class="cmt_word">Jerioth</span>, of whom nothing is said; and the verse adds obscurity by saying, her sons are these, without plainly indicating to which woman reference is made. It may be safely presumed, however, from what follows, that Azubah is intended, though no other part of Scripture helps us By so much as a mention of the sons' names to determine it certainly. Meantime one Hebrew manuscript and the Chaldee Paraphrase are found to omit the words "and by Jerioth." The Vulgate, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, make Jerioth one of the <span class="accented">children -</span> possibly a daughter - of Caleb and Azubah, and this view is supported by Kennicott and Houbigant (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). The tone of ver. 19 may certainly he held to offer some countenance to the assumption that either Jerioth's name ought to appear as that of a child or not at all. The name <span class="cmt_word">Ephrath</span> in this verse abounds with interest. The ancient name of the town of Bethlehem, and also apparently of a district round it, is the same word which is found here as the name of a woman. In either case it is more generally written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as even in the two other appearances of it in this very chapter.

The mother Ephrath is here interesting for her descendants given, her son <span class="cmt_word">Hur</span>, grandson <span class="cmt_word">Uri</span>, and great-grandson <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>.

Two sons of Hezron by Abiah are given (the latter of them a posthumous child), but the elder having a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jair</span> tracked, no doubt as one who became famous by the number of cities he took. He was thus connected on the father's side with a great family of Judah, and on the mother's with a great family of Manasseh.

Evident stress is laid on his maternal descent. Thus (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>) he is styled son of Manasseh, and hence also the explanation of the last clause of ver. 23, <span class="accented">infra</span>, all these belonged to <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Machir the father of Gilead</span>. Some of the cities alluded to are the Havoth-Jair (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>), Englished as the "groups of <span class="accented">dwellings</span> of Jair," on which see interesting note in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (edit. 1866), vocabulary, pp. 526, 527. They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, "And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities." "Took" is supposed to mean here "retook," or "recovered." Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them.

The Vulgate has <span class="accented">Ingressus est Caleb ad Ephratam</span>, but our Hebrew text cannot be made to justify it, if for nothing else, for want of a preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> before "Ephrata." This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> might be substituted for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon <span class="accented">that</span> showing we have to <span class="accented">suppose</span> that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in <span class="accented">loc.</span>) between that fact and what is said about <span class="cmt_word">Abiah</span>. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or <span class="accented">founder - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tekoa</span>, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in <span class="accented">distinction</span> from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb.

This statement would lead us to suppose that we were assuredly reading of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; but it cannot be so. The name of Caleb, with the questions gathering round it, will be best considered here. Of the nine times in which it occurs in this chapter, the mere duplicates (of vers. 20, 46, 48) may be at once counted off. The compound "Caleb-ephratah" of ver. 24 has been already dealt with. Nor need we for the present suppose ver. 50 to have any real meaning inconsistent with its apparent meaning, viz. that Caleb is the name of a grandson (son of Hut) as well as of the grandfather. There remain the occasions of the occurring of the word in vers. 9, 18, 42, 49. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The first appearance, then, of the name in this chapter (ver. 9) exhibits it in a form different from that in which it appears the other times in this chapter or elsewhere, viz. as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> (or once as a patronymic, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The Vulgate follows the Hebrew, but the Septuagint has at once substituted Caleb. The Syriac Version has Salchi, and the Arabic Sachli, both of them, no doubt, mere transcribers' errors through the mistake of a letter. This form "Chelubai" is, then, an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and no different account has yet been given of the name appearing thus on this one occasion. It may be described, with Lange ('Comm. Old Testament,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>), as "adjectivus gentilis" to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, which word, however, occur where it will, is never treated as a synonym with Caleb except by the Septuagint, and then but once (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">1 Chronicles 4:11</a>), making Lange's further claim of <span class="accented">three</span> forms for the name of Caleb wrong. The name might be translated the "Cheluban" or "Chelubite." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Caleb called here first "Chelubai," again" Caleb the son of Hezron," and now "Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel," some, and Keil among them, have endeavoured to identify with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. This latter is a well-known figure in history. He, together with Joshua, was among those who, departing from Egypt, were pursued of Pharaoh, and of all the host these two alone lived to enter into the promised land. This is enough to give him distinction and a prominent place before the eye. To this Caleb unmistakable reference is made in twenty-eight passages, in sixteen of which he is called "son of Jephunneh," and in three of those sixteen "son of Jephunneh the Kenazite." Now, he tells us himself (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>) that he was forty years old in the seceded year after the Exodus. But it seems (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12, 26</a>) that Hezron, grandson of Judah, and the father of the Caleb of this chapter, was, however young, one of those who went down into Egypt with Jacob, at a date, according to any chronology, which must render it impossible for any son of his to have been alive and only forty years of age at the time of the Exodus. This being so, either the statement already referred to, found at the close of ver. 49, that "the daughter of Caleb was Achsa," must be an interpolation from some ignorant transcriber's marginal annotation, or, unlikely as it is, Caleb the son of Hezron and Caleb the son of Jephunneh both named a daughter Achsa. It is, moreover, likely enough that the frequent describing of Caleb the son of Jephuuneli in this style was occasioned by the desire to distinguish him from some other Caleb, <span class="accented">not</span> a contemporary, indeed, but already well known m a generation preceding but not too remote. Other considerations decidedly concur with this view: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ram is <span class="accented">brother</span> of Caleb the son of Hezron; he has a grandson, Nahshon, of great distinction," a prince of the children of Judah," whose sister Aaron married; he was the elect of the Judah tribe to assist Moses and Aaron in the first numbering of the people (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>). Great prominence is given to him (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>). He was clearly (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-32.htm">Luke 3:32</a>) fifth in descent from Judah, in perfect agreement with the table of this chapter. Now, it was this <span class="accented">grandson</span> of the <span class="accented">elder</span> brother of Caleb who was contemporary with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. Similarly, the Bezaleel of this chapter (ver. 20), a great-grandson of Caleb the Hezronite, is spoken of (<a href="../../par/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>) at the same date exactly at which Caleb the son of Jephunneh says he was still but forty years of age l <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The identity of the Caleb of ver. 50, son of Hut, with Caleb the son of Jephuuneh is supposed by some, but is not clear. It appears to be asserted, without explanation, in the arts. "Caleb" and "Ephrath," signed A. C. H., Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' though in the second part of the latter article it is alluded to as only possible. On the other hand, it may rather be that Caleb the son of Jephunneh, instead of being identical with this Caleb the son of Hur, is so called in order to distinguish him from this latter as a contemporary. Again, it has been happily conjectured ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that just as ver. 33 closes the table of Jerahmeel with "<span class="cmt_word">These were the sons of Jerahmeel</span>," so ver. 49 should close the table of Caleb (ver. 42) with the words, These were the Boris of Caleb. With a slight alteration, ver. 50 would then begin <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Hur</span>, etc. This is, however, only conjecture. Ver. 42, then, must be considered to give us another family of Caleb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a family by another wife, of name not given, just possibly the Jerioth unaccounted for in ver. 18. The first statement lauds us in perplexity. <span class="cmt_word">Mesha</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) is the <span class="cmt_word">firstborn</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the wife or woman in question), and the <span class="cmt_word">founder of Ziph</span>. And amid some omission or corruption of text, we are then confronted with the words, <span class="cmt_word">and the sons of Marsehah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the father</span> (or again, perhaps <span class="accented">founder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of Hebron</span>. The reading of the Septuagint gives Mareshah in <span class="accented">both</span> of these passages, and may come from a Hebrew text that we have not. The substitution could, however, scarcely be accounted for as a <span class="accented">mere</span> clerical error, considering both the omission of a <span class="accented">resh</span> and the replacing of an <span class="accented">he</span> with an <span class="accented">ayin.</span> The sentence refuses at present any treatment except the unsatisfactory one of pure conjecture. But employing this, it may be noted that the omitting of the words, "the sons of," before Mareshah would most help to clear the verse of confusion. In this and following verses, <span class="cmt_word">Ziph, Hebron, Tappuah, Jorkoam,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Beth-zur,</span> are all names of places certainly, whether or not they are all of persons.

It is not linked to the context, and nothing is known of the six sons assigned to the person owning it. That Gazez occurs twice in the previous verse is remarkable, and suggestive, possibly, of mistake. The Septuagint omits altogether the clause in which it is found the second time. Houbigant translates, "Porro Haran genuit Jahdai," and so summarily removes the difficulty from his way (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). Hiller ('Onomasticon,' S.) would make it the same name as Moza, but without any pretence of argument. A more reasonable suggestion than this might be that Jahdai is the name of yet another concubine of Caleb (Lange, 'O.T. Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

To the seven years and six months (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, <span class="cmt_word">Bethshua</span>, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as <span class="accented">not</span> copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as <span class="cmt_word">Daniel</span>, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by <span class="cmt_word">Abigail</span>. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, "<span class="accented">leab</span>," constituting also the three first of the very next word," <span class="accented">of Abigail"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate "Caleb," both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>. The first of these omits <span class="cmt_word">Eliphelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nogah</span> (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet <span class="accented">Elpalet</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>). Again, <span class="cmt_word">Shimeah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Elishama</span> in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name <span class="cmt_word">Eliada</span> (God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), on occasion of its <span class="accented">latest</span> occurence (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>), appears as <span class="accented">Beel</span>iada (the Lord (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), preserving therein probably its <span class="accented">earlier form</span>, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

Some, however, have taken the Jehoahaz of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a> for him. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiakim</span> was not the original name of the next brother, but a name slightly altered by Pharaoh-Necho from Eliakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>). If the dates of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34, 36</a>, be correct, there is no doubt that, though Jehoiakim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Eliakim, reigned after Jehoahaz, yet he was the elder, and is in his right place in the present passage. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>) is another name of the Jehoa-haz of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30, 31, 34</a>, and several other places. It is possible that he finds the last place amid the four brothers of this verse because of his probable usurpation of the throne, in violation of the right of his elder brother, Jehoiakim, and the early fall he met with in consequence. Lastly, that the fourth brother, <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>, whose name (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>) was originally Mattha-niah, was put on the throne by the King of Babylon, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>) after that his nephew Jehoiachin (who could have no son old enough to succeed) was (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15, 17</a>) carried captive to Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Of the above four brothers, sons of Josiah, the second, Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, had a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jeconiah</span>, or Jehoiachin - essentially the same word. He was eighteen years of age when he succeeded his father (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>). A touching glimpse is given of him in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. His name is shortened to Coniah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a> and Jeremiah 37:1, though elsewhere in the same prophet, Jeconiah, and in one place (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), Jehoiachin. The name of <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span> occasions difficulty in this verse. In the first instance, following the examples of vers. 10-14, we should presume that this Zedekiah is set forth as a son of Jeconiah, and as it is not said that he <span class="accented">reigned</span> after Jeconiah (for it was undoubtedly Jeconiah's uncle Zedekiah who reigned after him), we need only have read it as a statement of one of his sons. Against this, however, there are two tolerably decisive considerations; for, <span class="accented">first</span>, the verse opens confessedly by offering us <span class="cmt_word">sons of Jehoiakim</span>, and these two, Jeconiah and Zedekiah, will fulfil the promise of that plural; and again, the seventeenth verse enters upon the formal enumeration of <span class="accented">sons to</span> Jeconiah. The question, therefore, returns - Who was this Zedekiah, <span class="accented">son</span> of Jehoiakim? Some consider him identical with the Zedekiah of the previous verse, and that "his son" means here "his successor." This undoes fewer difficulties than it makes. If the text be not corrupt, the likeliest solution is to suppose that this Zedekiah of ver. 16 is an otherwise unknown brother of Jeconiah, and son of Jehoiakim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - These verses contain a line of descent brought down to a point not merely posterior to the Exile, but possibly reaching to the time of Alexander. This line, however, through Solomon is lost so soon as the first name, that of Assir, is passed; Salathiel (Authorized Version)or Shealtiel, being descended from David, not through Solomon, but through Nathan, whole brother to Solomon. This Assir is not known from any parallel passage; and Luther, Starke, Bertheau, and others, followed by Zoekler (in Lange, 'Comm. O.T.') translate the name as <span class="accented">captive</span>, applying it to Jeconiah. Not all their reasons, however, <span class="accented">for</span> this, outweigh one which must be pronounced <span class="accented">against</span> it, viz. the absence of the article. The Septuagint and Vulgate versions agree with our own. The greater probability might be that Assir derived his name from being born after Jeconiah was in captivity, and such passages as <a href="../../par/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>, may throw some light upon the extinction of Solomon's line here, and the transfer of the succession (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a>, and see interesting note on the present place in 'Speaker's Commentary'). Salathiel is the Authorized Version incorrect rendering of the Hebrew Shealtiel. In <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> it is said, "And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;" and in <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, "Salathiel, which was <span class="accented">the son</span> of Neri." Now, Neri was in the direct line of Nathan. There seems only one way of reconciling these statements - and the method removes similar difficulties in other places also - viz, to distinguish between the descent <span class="accented">natural</span> and the descent <span class="accented">royal</span>, and then acknowledge that the former was swallowed up, where necessary, of the latter. One as decisive instance of this kind as that before us is most useful to rule other cases. (For an important allusion to the house and family of Nathan's descendants, as well known at the time, see <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> - a passage probably dating a few years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.), 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Of the name <span class="cmt_word">Malchiram</span> and five following, it must be left still doubtful whose sons they were - whether of Jeconiah (comp. again <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>) or of Neri as possibly brothers of Salathiel, or of neither of these. The first of these suppositions seems almost untenable, the second seems unlikely enough, and the exceeding prevalence of a corrupt text would strongly favour the third supposition. At the same time, it may be observed that ver. 19 proves that the names must belong to the royal succession, and indicates that, whoever Salathiel was in such aspect, that <span class="cmt_word">Pedaiah</span> was, who becomes father of Zerubbabel. The verses that follow are thought by Eichhorn, Dahler, Keil, and some others to be an interpolation of later date, chiefly on account of the point to which the genealogy is brought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Pedaiah <i>were</i>, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Pedaiah is now given as the father of <span class="cmt_word">Zeraubabel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span>. Of the latter of these nothing else is known, unless Lord Hervey's theory below be correct. The former is a great name - its derivation perhaps doubtful. Strictly it signifies "scattered to Babylon," but (Gesenius, 'Lexicon') if the initial part of the word be strengthened into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, the signification might be "born in Babylon." We have in this name another instance of the treatment just commented on with regard to the name Salathiel in <a href="../../par/luke/3-28.htm">Luke 3:28</a>. Zerubbabel is elsewhere invariably described as <span class="accented">son</span> of Salathiel, or Shealtiel; but as the genealogy of St. Luke gives the <span class="accented">natural</span> descent of Salathiel as from Neri, so does our genealogy in this one place give us the natural descent of Zerubbabel as from Pedaiah, one of Salathiel's brothers; while all other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-12.htm">Haggai 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>)give us that for which the genealogical table is chiefly designed, viz. the matter of <span class="accented">succession</span>, according to which Zerubbabel would be-shown as <span class="accented">son</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> link of succession, following on Shealtiel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span>. Though this name recurs, and very frequently, in Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, yet the person here denoted by it - son of Zerubbabel - is found here only. <span class="cmt_word">Hananiah</span>, 1.q. Joanna of <a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, the names being the same, but with the component parts transposed, as in instances already given above. In the Gospel, Hananiah appears as <span class="accented">grandson</span> of Zorobabel, Rhesa intervening. <span class="cmt_word">Shelomith</span>. This person is mentioned here only. The word, though evidently a feminine form, is found for the name of a man, chief of the Izarhites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-18.htm">1 Chronicles 23:18</a>), but very possibly by a mere clerical error, as the true form is given in the very next chapter (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>) for the same character, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>.

What that reason may be is not known. Perhaps the most natural supposition is that their mother was not the same. The meaning of some of the names, as especially of the last, <span class="cmt_word">Jushab-hesed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Loving-kindness is returned," has led Bertheau and others to the conjecture that they may be separated as children born to Zerubbabel, one of the leaders of the return from captivity, after that return. This seems plausible, except for the consideration that, the more plausible it is, the more we might expect the explanation itself to have been notified. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-21.htm">1 Chronicles 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The Hebrew text, followed by the Vulgate, not followed by the Septuagint, reads here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>. Yet some manuscripts have the plural "sons," from which comes our Authorized Version. The indication is important. It is doubly interesting, as the only indication in our Hebrew text that tends to give confirmation to the very noteworthy differences of the Septuagint Version. For although this last, apparently somewhat perversely, begins its version with "sons," which plural does not so well suit its sequel, instead of the "son" of our Hebrew text, which would suit it, yet it proceeds with a translation which must have been obtained from another text, such text again suiting properly the <span class="accented">singular</span> - "son" <span class="accented">-</span> of our Hebrew. The form of its translation is analogous to that marked in the words of vers. 10-14. "The <span class="accented">sons</span> [sic <span class="accented">son</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">Ananiah, Pelatiah</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesaiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Rephaiah</span> <span class="accented">his son</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Arnan</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Obadiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Shechaniah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son," making six (presumably) consecutive generations. This, therefore, is the reading which (if correct) might carry down the genealogy to the times of Alexander the Great, and indeed to a time a quarter of a century later. And in doing so, it would certify this entry as of later date than probably any other of the canon! If we reject this position and reading, we have to get over the term, repeated several times, <span class="cmt_word">the sons of</span>. To do this, Bertheau <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the intention of our passage was, from the name Rephaiah inclusive, not to mention the individual four brothers' names, but to mention them as four distinguished families among the posterity of David - an attempt at explanation certainly not satisfactory. The conclusion of the matter <span class="accented">is</span>, that in this twenty-first verse we have difficulties in either alternative, not satisfactorily explained. Either we have the names in all of six brothers, being "<span class="accented">sons</span> of Hananiah" - the last four of whom are styled, not by their individual names, but as heads of families; or we have six lineal descendants from Hananiah. If this last supposition were correct, calculate a royal <span class="accented">succession</span> at the lowest average (say something under twenty years), and the genealogy, including what follows in the remaining verses of the chapter, will bring <span class="accented">us</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> above, to a date that covers the whole life of Alexander the Great. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Shechaniah; Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah; Hattush, and Igeal, and Bariah, and Neariah, and Shaphat, six.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - In the obscurity that obtains on the subject, there is one somewhat bright star of light in a succeeding name, <span class="cmt_word">Hattush</span>, to which this verse leads us. This verse purports to help on the line of genealogy by a contribution of two descents, the effective names being <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Neariah</span>, the line coming to its close by aid of two other effective names, <span class="accented">Elioenai</span> and (say) <span class="accented">Hodaiah</span>, contained in the last two verses of the chapter. Although one manifest error in ver. 22 (involved in the number "six" when only five sons have been read) betokens the insecurity of the text, yet the summary measures of the ingenious Lord A. C. Hervey (see his valuable work on the 'Genealogies of our Lord Jesus Christ,' pp. 103, 307, 322; and articles in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:666, 667) can scarcely be warranted, when he wishes <span class="accented">first</span> to omit altogether the words <span class="cmt_word">and the sons of Shecaniah; Shemaiah</span>; and <span class="accented">next</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> regard Shemaiah as Shimei, the brother of Zerub-babel, and, as matter of course, those who followed as the descendants of this brother of Zerubbabel, instead of Zerubbabel himself. Now, a passage in the Book of Ezra helps us much here. Ezra mentions, as one of those of the "sons of David" who went up with him from Babylon to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2, 3</a>), Hattush, "of the sons of Shechaniah." There is not only nothing to prevent this Hattush being the same as the elder brother of Neariah, who comes fourth in succession from Zerubbabel (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the hypothesis that the six names of ver. 21 are brothers, not a line of descents), but at the above-mentioned average of twenty years the dates will admirably synchronize - the last date of Zerubbabel being about  <span class="date">B.C. 520</span>, and that of Neariah  <span class="date">B.C. 440</span>; while the date of Ezra's journey was  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' 3:186, 187). This coincidence of names and dates must not be regarded as con-elusive; but, pending further discovery, it strongly disfavours the idea of the names of ver. 21 constituting a succession, and it keeps well in check the rate of succeeding generations, bringing the last member of the succession to a date that may be harmonized with others which have for the most part held their ground. That in ver. 22 only five names are given for what are summed up as "<span class="accented">six</span>," must lead to the supposition that one has dropped out; and since no known manuscript of the Hebrew text, nor the Septuagint or Vulgate versions supplies us with the missing name, the Syriac and Arabic versions, which supply the name Azariah between Neariah and Shaphat, must be viewed with some suspicion. <span class="cmt_word">Igeal</span> is, in the Hebrew, a word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>) identical with the Igal of <a href="../../par/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-36.htm">2 Samuel 23:36</a> - Septuagint in the latter passages <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bb;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;</span>, but in the present place <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. Of the other persons in this verse little or nothing else is known.

The first verses follow in the direction already indicated in ch. 2, near the end of which we were left with Shobal and Haroeh, probably the same with Reaiah (the same name as Reaia, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:5</a>, though not the same person). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - The Carrot of ver. 1 is considered to lie doubtful between the Carmi of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-7.htm">1 Chronicles 2:7</a> or the Chelubai of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>, in which last alternation the five names of this verse would repeat the line of descent with which chrii, had made us familiar. Even then the object or advantage of repeating the first four of these, so far as what follows is concerned, is not evident. We keep near the close of ch. 2. also in respect of another allusion to the Zorathites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-53.htm">1 Chronicles 2:53</a>), whose families were replenished by the two sons of Jahath, Ahumai and Lahad, of all of whom this is all we know.

It was near Tekoah (ver. 5, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>) and Bethlehem (next verse). The hiatus in the first clause may possibly be supplied by "the families of" from the last verse, or, more fitly, by "the sons of," inasmuch as some manuscripts have it so. The Septuagint, however, and Vulgate <span class="accented">displace</span> "the father of" (<span class="accented">i.e. chief of</span>), replacing it by "the sons of." The Syriac Version leaves out any notice of the sister, Hazelelponi, and gives the former part of the verse thus: "These are Amina-dab's sons, Ahizareel, Nesma, and Dibas, Pheguel and Husia; These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratha, who was the father," etc. With this the Arabic Version is partly in agreement, but closes the verse with the words, "These are the sons of Hur, son of Ephratha, the father of whom [plural] was of Bethlehem." The Chronicle Targum translates, "the <span class="accented">rabbis dwelling at</span> Etam." This variety indicates the difficulty felt by each in turn. The verse, however, purports to give the names of three brothers and one sister (Hazelel-poni, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shadow looking at me, Gesenius) connected with Etam, as in the following verse Penuel with Gedor (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) and Ezer with Hushah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-29.htm">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>). Of no one of these, in all six other descendants of Hur, additional to those found at the close of ch. 2, is anything distinct known. It is to be noted that Hut himself is here called father of Bethlehem, while (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) his son Salma is so called.

The Roman Septuagint unaccountably gives different names to the mothers, and reverses the groups of the four and three children. Nothing else is known of these nine persons. The last two names of the group of four more resemble in form the name of the head of a family than an individual name; and for Jezoar, the middle name of the group of three, the easy Keri of "and Zohar" is followed by the Septuagint, and was followed by our 1611 Authorized Version.

The episode of these two verses, offering itself amid what should seem, superficially, a dry mass of dead names, is welcome and grateful as the oasis of the desert, and it warns us that life lies hidden at our every footfall on this ground, spread over though it is with monument and inscription, and hollow, as we thought, with the deadest of the dead. But the glimpse of old real life given us in this brief fragment of a biography is refreshing and is very suggestive. It seems an insufficient and unnatural method of accounting for the suddenness of the appearance of this episode to suppose ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in lee.</span>) that the name of Jahez was well known, from any cause, to those for whom Chronicles may be supposed to have been primarily intended. We prefer by far <span class="accented">one</span> account of it, viz. that the work in our hands is not in its original complete state; or, variously put, that it <span class="accented">is</span> in its uncompleted original state. No root corresponding to the characters of this name in present order is known; it is possible that some euphonic reason makes the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> out of the real word (future Kal) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he causes pains. We cannot suppose there would be any "play" appreciable on a transposition of alphabetical characters for <span class="accented">mere</span> play's sake. The resemblance that almost each part of this brief and abruptly introduced narration bears to incidents recorded in Genesis (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>) and Exodus speaks for itself, and strongly countenances the supposition that it is a genuine deposit of the genuinely olden history of Judah. The mother's reason for the naming of the child; the language and matter and form (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18-20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>) of the prayer of the child, when presumably he was no longer a child; and the discriminating use of the words <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (ver. 10) <span class="accented">of Israel</span>, as comps, red with the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; 5:41), generally found here, - all help to produce this impression, although some of these particulars would carry little conviction by themselves; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> a mother's reasons for assigning the name of her child long outlived the earlier times alone. Upon the whole, and regarding the passage in its present place, we may say that it must be very much <span class="accented">misplaced</span>, or else must be understood to connect Jabez with some branch of the family of Coz. There is the more room to assume this in the vagueness of the last preceding clause, "The families of Aharhel the son of Harum." The origin of the theories of some of the older Jewish writers, to the effect that Jabez was a doctor in the law, with a school of scribes around him, is probably to be found in the desire to find a connection between his proper name, Jabez, and the <span class="accented">place</span> so named (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>), and where, as we are told, "families of scribes dwelt," belonging to the Kenites. That these were connected with Bethlehem, through Salma, and that Jabez of our present passage was also of a family connected with Bethlehem, is worthy of notice, but is not enough by a long way to countenance the thought, in spite of Targum and Talmud (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>). The Targum, as well here as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>, identifies Jabez with Othniel "son of Keuaz" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>), or more probably "the Kenizzite" merely; but there is nothing to sustain such an identification. The description, he was more honourable than his brethren, finds a close parallel, so far as the word <span class="accented">honourable</span> goes, in <a href="../../par/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; although the honourableness of Shechem, the person there in question, does not come out to anything like the same advantage with that of Jabez, nor at all in the same direction. The word, however, is precisely the same, is often used elsewhere, and uniformly in a good sense, although the range of its application is wide. The essential idea of the root appears to be "weight." The phrase may therefore be supposed to answer to our expressive phrase, a "man of weight " <span class="accented">- the</span> weight being sometimes due <span class="accented">chiefly</span> to character, at other times to position and wealth in the first place, though not entirely divorced from considerations of character. We may safely judge, from what follows, that the intention in our present passage is to describe Jabez as a man of more ability and nobility than his brethren. It can scarcely be doubted that the meaning that lies on the surface is the correct interpretation, when it is said that his mother named him Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. The sorrow refers to unusual pains of travail, not to any attendant circumstances of domestic trial, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that the time of his birth was coincident with her own widowhood, as happened to the wife of Phinehas, when she named her offspring "Ichabod" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19-22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-10.htm">1 Chronicles 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep <i>me</i> from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - When Jabez grew to manhood he has learnt to estimate rightly the value of God's blessing. He invokes it, and depends upon it. His language implies the confidence that he had in the reality of providential blessing. For the expression, enlarge my coast, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-20.htm">Deuteronomy 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8</a>; and though we know nothing as matter of fact about the occasion of this prayer, we may assume that it was one when not selfishness and greed of larger territory, but just opportunity, had awakened a strong desire for enlargement of borders. It may have been a legitimate occasion of recovering his own, lost or wrongfully taken from him or his predecessors before him, or of expelling successfully from their hold upon it a portion of the original inhabitants of the promised land of God's people. That thine hand might be with me. Many are the beautiful parallels to be culled from the Word of God for this expression, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-5.htm">Psalm 139:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! This, the last entreaty of the prayer, is the largest and most far-seeing. Warned by his own name, forewarned by his mother's emphasizing of her own pains in him, he thus concludes. Having begun in the evil of pain and excessive sorrow, he prays that he and his career may not so determine and end. He does not necessarily pray to be preserved from all suffering, but from such baneful touch of evil itself, its principle, its tyrannous, merciless hold, as might bring him to real and irreparable grief. Thus closes the whole prayer, each succeeding clause of which has been under the rule of the initial "if," translated with us, Oh that. This well-known Hebrew form of prayer supposes a solemn engagement, and that the answered prayer shall meet with the fulfilment of a vowed promise on the part of the suppliant, according to the pattern of <a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>. In the absence of that engagement here, we may notice, with Keil, the greater grace of the passage, in that it closes with the statement of the readiness to <span class="accented">hear</span>, and the abounding readiness to <span class="accented">answer</span>, on the part of Divine beneficence: And God granted him that which he requested. Evidently the thing that he asked pleased the Lord (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10, 12</a>); although it was in this case some form of riches, and long life for self, and the life of his enemies, that he asked, and was <span class="accented">not</span> altogether and in so many words "a wise and understanding heart." Perhaps, also there was in the way of asking, and in the exact occasion, unknown to us, something which quite justified the matter of the prayer, and which thus pleased the Lord. The remarkable and arresting episode could not have closed in more welcome or impressive way than when it is thus briefly but conclusively said, "And God granted him that which he requested."

The fact of the antithesis of the Jewess wife (by some assigned as wife to Ezra), and the presumably Egyptian wife mentioned in the latter verse, is perhaps just enough in the general obscurity to suggest that Mered, the asserted husband of the latter, is to be understood as the husband of the former also But to compass so much as this, we have to overlook omission in ver. 17 and inversion in ver. 18. There is a tone about the verses, due to names they contain, that might suggest to us the times of Egypt and Moses, and traditions in keeping do not fail to come to view in Jerome ('Quaestiones,' etc.; see also art. "Meted," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The four places, Eshtemoa, Gedor, Socho, Zanoah, may all with tolerable confidence be identified in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-58</a>, as of the number of the cities "in the mountains," though Zanoah and Socho are found also "in the valley" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a>).

It would appear now that Shelah gave the name of the slain brother to his son. Respecting this Er of Lecah - with little doubt the name of a place - and Laadah, nothing else can be adduced; but Marebah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>) is the name of a place in the <span class="accented">Shefelah</span>, given in the same passage with Kailah and Nezib (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>).

Gesenius says that, after long research and dispute, microscopic investigations in London have concluded that the threads of the cloth of <span class="accented">byssus</span> are linen, not cotton. Ashbea (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>) is not yet recognized elsewhere. Jokim. Gesenius considers this name (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) as a contracted form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Joiakim) of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a>.

The meaning of this name is "lying;" not found elsewhere, it is probably the same as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, a town in the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), and <span class="accented">that is</span> probably the same as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;</span>, of the "valley" list of Judah cities (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>) and of <a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, where it is mentioned in near connection with the Mareshah, which also accompanies it in the above "valley" list. Joash. This name appears in three forms: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in the text and <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>. Seraph. This is the word the plural of which gives us our <span class="accented">seraphim</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), and is from a root of somewhat uncertain meaning. The different significations to which the root seems to lend itself in the substantive, according as it is used in the singular or plural, are startling (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub <span class="accented">voce</span>). The apparent meaning of this verse is that there was a time of old, when the above, of whom we can ascertain nothing elsewhere, ruled over Moab. Jerome, in the Vulgate, has made a strange rendering of this verse by translating some of the proper names, and reading at least one of them, the first, as though it were a form in the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which it is not: <span class="accented">Et qui stare fecit solem</span>, <span class="accented">virique Mendacii et Securus et Tircendens</span>, <span class="accented">qui principes fuerunt in Moab et qui reversi sunt in Lahem</span>; <span class="accented">haec autem verba vetera.</span> Thus Jokim is turned into Elimelech, and the men of Chozeba into Mahlon and Chillon of the Book of Ruth, and Jashubi-lehem into Naomi and Ruth; and the last clause of the verse is equivalent to citing the Book of Ruth. Barrington ('Genealogies,' 1:179) regards Jokim as Shelah's third son in this enumeration; and ethers regard Jashubi-lehem as his fourth son. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> and following the verb, is to be noted Ver. 23 brings us to the last of Judah, and leaves us to part with the account of the tribe in the same obscurity which has lately involved it. The plants and hedges are probably an instance of inopportune translation of proper names, which should rather appear as <span class="accented">Nelaira</span> and <span class="accented">Gedara</span>, the former place or people not found elsewhere, but the latter possibly referred to. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>. Again, <span class="accented">who</span> they were that were the potters, is not clear - whether all of the preceding verse, or the last mentioned. From the last clause it may be probably safely concluded, that those designated, whoever they were, were employed habitually in the service, not indeed of one king necessarily, but of the succession of royalty. Passages that may be taken to throw interesting light upon this subject are <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25-31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-29</a>.

That comparison shows six names in both of those passages for only five here, and it shows also difference in three of the names, viz. Jemuel, Zohar, and Jachin, for Nemuel, Zeta, and Jarib. On the other hand, the list of <a href="../../par/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12</a> is in exact agreement with our list here (the omission of Ohad in both being sufficiently accounted for by one and the same reason), with the exception of Jarib here for Jachin still there; and this solitary difference may justly be suspected to be nothing but an early corruption of <span class="accented">resh</span> for <span class="accented">caph</span> and <span class="accented">beth</span> for <span class="accented">nun</span> (see Kennicott, 'Diss.,' 1:178; Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:55).

Of Shallum, the first, it may be noted that there are fourteen others of the same name in the Old Testament; and of Mibsam and Mishma (whom some call brothers, surely in error), that there were others of the same name (and certainly given as brothers), viz. the sons of Ishmael (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; ch. 1:29). Ver. 26 adds apparently another three descents, viz. from Mishma. Of the first-named of these, Hamuel, it may be noted that the name appears in many Hebrew manuscripts as <span class="accented">Chammuel</span>; of the second-named, Zacchur, that six others of the same name (though the Authorized Version gives them Zaccur) are found in Numbers, the First Book of Chronicles, and Nehemiah; while on the third, Shimei (of which name the Old Testament contains fifteen others), our attention is especially detained as father of sixteen sons and six daughters, though it is observed that his brethren (query <span class="accented">Hammuel</span> and <span class="accented">Zacchur</span>) had not large families. The smallness of the whole tribe relatively to Judah, was only saved from being smaller by him. With this agrees the census of <a href="../../par/numbers/1-23.htm">Numbers 1:23, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-4.htm">Numbers 2:4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>.

The movement took place in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah (B.C. 726-698). That the house of their fathers had increased greatly is probably mentioned as some explanation of the cause of the movement. Though in one name out of the thirteen (ver. 35) the ancestors are traced to the third generation, and in another (ver. 37) to the fifth, no name is reached of the sons of Simeon enumerated in vers. 24-27.

There is a town of the name situated in the mountainous district of Judah between Halhul and Beth-zur, to the north of Hebron (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>). It is evident that this cannot be the place we require here. There is another town of the name (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a>), probably belonging to Benjamin, and which as little admits of being fitted in here.

The Hebrew word, however, generally applied to the valley of Gerar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, wady) is not the word used here of Gedor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, ravine). See Stanley's 'Syria and Palestine,' p. 159, and note. Not only are references frequent to the fertility of Gerar, but the significance of that in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a> speaks for itself. This alteration of reading, however, with acceptance of the Septuagint manuscripts, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and Keil ('Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) offers some suggestions of weight against those of Ewald, Bertheau, and others.

So the Authorized Version, which has mistakenly Englished a word which should have been left a proper name, "the Maon-ires," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people elsewhere called in the Authorized Version the Mahunim. In doing this, our translators followed the Targum, copied by Luther and Junius (but see Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' 1002 a; 'Notes on Burckhardt,' 1069; Bertheau, in 'Chronik.;' and Septuagint reading). Unto this day, in this verse, as also in ver. 43, must not be understood to mark the date of the compiler of Chronicles, but that of the document or authority upon which he as a compiler drew - anterior, of course, to the Captivity.

And of them we should prefer to apply to those already mentioned (vers. 34-41), did the expression stand alone. But the following clause in apposition, of the sons of Simeon, seems intended to <span class="accented">prevent</span> the supposition that <span class="accented">they are</span> the Simeonites to whom alone allusion is made. Keil again ('Comm.,' in <span class="accented">loc</span>.) refers those intended to ver. 27, because he reads, for Ishi, the Shimei of ver. 27, on very insufficient grounds. It is a question whether the movement of ver. 42 is to be understood as arising out of that other the account of which closes in ver. 41, or whether it were not a co-ordinate movement. It still would probably enough spring from the same intrinsic causes. The allotment of the tribe of Simeon carved out of that of Judah was found too small for their growing numbers, though Simeon was not of the most numerous. Nor is it necessary to suppose - perhaps it is rather necessary to <span class="accented">correct</span> the impression - that this expedition, issuing in a permanent settlement, lay at all near the conquests of the "thirteen princes." It is, on the whole, most natural to consider that one event concludes with ver. 41, and that the following events (vers. 42, 43) are distinct and independent. All requisite light as to who these "smitten Amalekites" were, is for them too significantly furnished by comparison of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>; with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>.

The tribe of Reuben is now taken third in order by the compiler, though Reuben was the first of all the sons of Israel. The distinct statements of vers. 1 and 2, respecting the degradation of Reuben and his loss of the rights of primogeniture, are not to be understood, however, as mentioned in any way to account for his standing third here. That Judah takes in any genealogy the first place needs no other apology than that contained in this passage, "Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> David, and in him "David's greater Son and Lord"). And that Simeon is taken immediately after Judah was natural enough, both because the second place belonged to him, and because his tribe, in journeying, in settlement, and in acknowledged friendship, was so nearly related to that of Judah. It is as an important historical fact, a lesson and stern memento of crime, that the tale of Reuben is here as elsewhere told. Indeed, in the remarkably exalting language applied to Reuben (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>) by the dying father in those "blessings" of his sons which were so marvellously living with prophecy, that "blessing" seemed weighted with hard reality, and may really carry this meaning: "O Reuben I <span class="accented">though</span> thou <span class="accented">art</span> my firstborn, <span class="accented">though</span> my might and the beginning of my strength, <span class="accented">though</span> the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power," <span class="accented">yet</span>, because of thy boiling lust (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>) "thou shall not excel." In that endowing charter of the patriarch's death-bed, the birthright of Reuben is not in so many words given to Joseph and his sons, but what is given to Joseph is so abundant above the lot of all the others, that we find no difficulty in accepting the formal statement of the fact here first found in this passage. The large measure of promise meted to Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>) rests, no doubt, upon the title already referred to. There would seem to be also a righteous moral reason in Joseph after all becoming heir to the birthright, inasmuch as he was the eldest child of her who was Israel's real love, and who, but for deception and sharp practice, would have been his first wife. How he remembered her, and with what determined practical consequence, the affecting passage, <a href="../../par/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1-7, 16, 21, 22</a>, sufficiently reveals; yet comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>. The meaning of the last clause of ver. 1 is evidently that, though thus Reuben was the natural firstborn, and Joseph had really the birthright, the registration did not proceed in this instance (probably partly for the very reason of the ambiguity) by the order of birthright, but everything yielded to the special call for precedence on the part of Judah (ver. 2).

Nebo was the name of a heathen deity, known among the Chaldeans (<a href="../../par/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), Babylonians, and Assyrians; and this constituted one reason, if not the reason, for changing its name when it had been affixed to the Moabite city.

It takes us to the time of Saul, and from that time up to the time of "the Captivity" (ver. 22) the victorious Reubenites, Gadites, and people of the half-tribe Manasseh had the benefit of enlarged domain at their expense: "They dwelt in their steads," after seizing great spoil. It is exceedingly likely that we have the perpetuation of the name Hagarenes in the Agraeei (modern Hejer) of Strabo, 16:767; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32; Dionysius, 'Perieg.,' 956; Pt. 5:2 (see art.

Gad was born seventh in order of all the sons of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-9.htm">Genesis 30:9-12</a>), and first of the children of Leah's maid Zilpah. The compiler seems to pass easily on to Gad, from the mere circumstance of the name of the tribe being so constantly linked with that preceding, in the matter of local settlement on the east of Jordan, after the journeyings of the wilderness (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7, 8</a>). The geography in vers. 11 and 16 offers very little difficulty. Compared with the time of the first settling of the Gadites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10-13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25, 30</a>), it is evident that they had pushed their borders further to the north, trenching somewhat upon the lot of the half-tribe Manasseh, as <span class="accented">they</span> also in turn extended their limits northward to Hermon (ver. 23).

"In Gilead in Bashan" may be read, with some, as two coordinate places, separating them by a stop; or may point to a time when Bashan included the upper half of Gilead. Sharon, which Keil, quoting Reland, 'Pal. Ill.,' 370, would make the well-known Sharon of Carmel and the Mediterranean, is, though unmentioned elsewhere, probably distinguished sufficiently from it by the absence of the article, which is invariably prefixed to the other. Stanley's suggestion ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 484, 485, 260) would seem exceedingly apt, that it is one in fact, as one in derivation and meaning, with the <span class="accented">Mishor</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "level ]ands," "table-land") of Gilead and Bashan. With this explanation, however, the term "suburbs" does not so well agree. Upon the other side, distant as the well-known Sharon is, a link of connection might be found with it, in that the other Manasseh half-tribe stretched into its plains; and in that case the last word of the verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, might mean (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>) "the outgoings" of the land or regions in question to the "sea"-coast.

Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of <span class="accented">effecting</span> the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history.

He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance," So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land." It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-29</a>.

His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan</span>.

He was one of the travellers with Jacob into Egypt, was probably about twenty years the junior of Joseph, lived thirty years after his death, and attained the age of one hundred and thirty-three years, after a residence in Egypt of about one hundred and fifteen years in all. The Kohathites are expressly mentioned in their sacred duties in the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-8</a>), and in the time of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12-14</a>).

It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan. The two elder brothers of Eleazar, viz.

It is somewhat obscurely said that the sacred office remained in the family of Eleazar till, in the person of Eli, it passed awhile into that of Ithamar, his brother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>; Josephus, 8:1, &sect; 3), to be recovered again in the Zadok of our ver. 9 (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phinehas</span>; a memorable man (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30, 31</a>; which Grove well compares with <a href="../../par/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abishua</span>; only mentioned in this chapter and <a href="../../par/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>. Josephus (8:1, &sect; 3) asserts that he it was who was succeeded in the high priesthood, not by any one of his own descendants, but by Eli, till Zedok, in the time of David, all the intervening members of the Eleazar family being private individuals. But no reliance can be placed on this assertion, for see Josephus again (5:11, &sect; 5).

Lightfoot ('Temple Service,' 4. &sect; 1) supposes that the change of priesthood family to Ithamar took place after Meraioth. But it is just as probable that the gap between Abishua and Eli, or possibly even between Phinehas and Eli, was filled by holders of the high priest office unknown by name to us.

With this name begins the light again. Ahitub, Zadok, Ahimaaz, and Azariah are of frequent mention in the Books of Samuel and Kings. Ahitub, here and elsewhere plainly given as father of Zadok, seems to be given as father of Meraioth in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, and grandfather of Zadok; and in both passages is termed "ruler of the house of God" - an expression probably equivalent to high priest, as Azariah, high priest in the reign of Hezekiah, is also so described (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-13.htm">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>). The recurrence of the two names Ahitub and Zadok in vers. 11 and 12 is very possibly the result of some error; and it is in favour of such a supposition, in some form of it, at all events, that in that place, where, including Shallum (or Meshullam), only three steps are found, several more seem to be required - the period one of some one hundred and eighty years, and filled in the list of Judah's kings by as many as nine in succession. On the other hand, it is open to question whether the recurrence of the names Ahitub and Zadok be not legitimate. And this may then be the solution of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, as above, with their insertion of Meraioth  - still other names being absent which would make up the requisite number of generations. <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>. The earliest glimpse we get of him is in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-28.htm">1 Chronicles 12:28</a>, where he is introduced as "a young man mighty of valour," who now casts in his lot with David at Hebron, on Saul's death. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24, 29, 35</a>, we find him and Abiathar the recognized priests. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8</a>, we find him true to David when Abiathar joined Adonijah - the punishment of the latter and the reward of the former being recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27, 35</a>, respectively. Up to that time it is evident. that Abiathar had precedence in rank over Zadok. His death is not recorded, but it must be assigned to a date previous to the dedication of the temple, from the account of which (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>.) his name is entirely absent. The last allusions to him are in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-2.htm">1 Kings 4:2, 4</a>; in the latter of which verses (specially coupled as the name is with the deposed Abiathar) the notice is probably as merely <span class="accented">historical as</span> it certainly is in the former. This same verse states that Azariah was "the priest," and that he was son, <span class="accented">i.q.</span> grandson, of Zadok, proving, with very little doubt, that the explanatory parenthesis of our ver. 10 should follow the Azariah mentioned in the <span class="accented">previous</span> verse.

The latter half of ver. 19, according to the Hebrew, should rather refer to what has preceded, and be a "subscription," though it might best suit the connection to regard it as introducing what was to follow, and as being a "superscription."

From the occurrence of the name Shimei in this latter, though in the wrong place, viz. after Jahath in the descending order, instead of before him, some think, Keil and Zockler among them, that it is a line from Shimei, the <span class="accented">brother</span> of Libni, and second son of Gershom. If this be so, the occurrence of three names, the same and in the same order, is a thing to be remarked, though possible enough in itself.

Without the occurrence of this clue, we should have been at a loss to tell who Amminadab was, as we are now at a loss to explain the unexplained substitution of this new name. The Vatican Septuagint has Amminadab, while the Alexandrine has altered to Izhar, probably deeming the other name a mere error. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Korah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/16-27.htm">Numbers 16:27, 32, 33</a>, with Numbers 26:9-11).

This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the "son of Zerah" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of <a href="../../par/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>.

This is a good instance of how the use of the same names, though in different order, clung to a tribe or family through long periods. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, <i>to wit</i>, of Tola: <i>they were</i> valiant men of might in their generations; whose number <i>was</i> in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The six sons of <span class="cmt_word">Tola</span> given here are stated to be the six heads of the house <span class="accented">at the time of the census of David</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1-17</a>). The verse further states that the Tolaites had grown to number at that time <span class="cmt_word">twenty-two thousand six hundred</span>, and as this fact is not <span class="accented">stated</span> elsewhere, it is pretty clear proof that the compiler had other sources of information in addition to those possessed by us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-3.htm">1 Chronicles 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five</span>.

The Syriac, however, does not omit "and the sons of Izrahiah;" but alters the numeral "five" to "four." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">And with them, by their generations, after the house of their fathers, <i>were</i> bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand <i>men</i>: for they had many wives and sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - The meaning of these verses, especially of the former of them, is not quite evident. This seems to say that as the Tolaites were in David's time twenty-two thousand six hundred, so the Uzzites taken from among them (or the "sons of Izrahiah," as the case may be) numbered thirty-six thousand additional. But were not the Uzzites included in the Tolaites? and did not the figure thirty-six thousand embrace the accumulated numbers, whilst the balance of fifty-one thousand necessary to make up the eighty-seven thousand of ver. 5, was drawn from all the other branches of the Issachar tribe? This is not the view, however, generally taken, and if the numbers of vers. 2 and 4 are distinct, the balance needful for ver. 5 will, of course, be twenty-eight thousand four hundred. It cannot be denied that this view is favoured by the special description applied to these Uzzites, or Izrahiahites, as bands of soldiers for war; their disposition and their training constituting possibly the reason of their being singled out for further description from among the sons of Tola. The statement of the total number of the tribe of Issachar in David's time is wonderfully corroborated by the two censuses of Moses - <a href="../../par/numbers/1-28.htm">Numbers 1:28, 29</a>, fifty-four thousand four hundred; and <a href="../../par/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23-25</a>, sixty-four thousand three hundred. The total of Issachar, <span class="cmt_word">four score and seven thousand</span>, is a good proportion of the aggregate total of all the tribes, given (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8, 9</a>) as eight hundred thousand. Grove, however, adds all the above numbers, and makes thereby Issachar's total (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:901 <span class="accented">b</span>) one hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred, which seems disfavoured by the numbers at the second census of Moses. At the time of this census Issachar came third of all the tribes, only Judah and Dan taking precedence. The <span class="cmt_word">bands of soldiers for war</span>. This expression culminates in the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "bands," which is applied (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>) to Gad, and almost invariably to the irregular but special bodies of fighting men of the nations round (Authorized Version, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a> is incorrect, the Hebrew word being different).

We have four passages for our authorities as to the sons of Benjamin, and it is not altogether easy to bring them into verbal harmony. They are <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a>; the present passage; and ch. 8. Our present passage mentions three sons, as though they were all, and immediately proceeds to their posterity. The list in Genesis mentions ten, of whom, however, we know (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-40.htm">Numbers 26:40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-3.htm">1 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a>) that three, Naaman, Ard, and Gem, were grandsons, being sons of Bela, under which circumstances the order in which the two former stand in Genesis is remarkable. Again, while Becher is given as the second son in both Genesis and our present place, he is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a> and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. Ashbel, who in Genesis is given as the third, is expressly called the second son. Among the Ephraimites, however (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>), a Becher, with his descendants the Bachrites, is mentioned, and it is not improbable that, by marriage, the family were at <span class="accented">that time</span>, for manifest reasons of inheritance and possession, reckoned in this tribe, though by blood of the tribe of Benjamin. This subject is skilfully discussed by Lord A. C. Hervey (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:175). Lastly, Jediael of this passage and ver. 10 is not found in Genesis, in Numbers, or in our ch. 8. This name seems to have superseded in our passage the name Ashbel in Genesis, though it is impossible to speak certainly. It cannot be supposed to designate the same person, but rather a descendant in the same branch, whose family had come to importance "in the days of David."

Naphtali was the second son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah, and in order of birth the fifth sen of Jacob, and was of course more closely allied to Dan, Ephraim, and Benjamin. The family was distinguished for its spirit throughout its history. At the Sinai census it numbered fifty-three thousand four hundred fighting men (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-42.htm">Numbers 1:42, 43</a>); but at the close of the wanderings through the wilderness its numbers had become only forty-five thousand four hundred. Its territory in the north, largely mountainous, bounded by Asher, Zebulun, and Manasseh, was some of the finest, and covered the district afterwards called Galilee, "the cradle of the Christian faith, the native place of most of the apostles, and the home of our Lord" (Grove). The slight difference in the spelling of <span class="cmt_word">Jahziel</span> in Genesis, and of <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> in Numbers, may be noticed. The following are interesting references to Naphtali in one or another portion of its history: - <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-19.htm">1 Chronicles 27:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-3.htm">Ezekiel 48:3, 4, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-6.htm">Revelation 7:6</a>.

The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words "his wife" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for "whom" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second "bare;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and she bare, or, she bare also Machir." But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a> and the other references already given.

Vers. 20, 21, purport to contain the line of descent from Ephraim through his son Shu-thelah to the seventh generation, viz. to another Shuthelah. The remaining two names, Ezer and Elead, may perhaps be two brothers of the first Shuthelah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> own sons of Ephraim. If it be so, these two must not be supposed to correspond with Becher and Tahan, called "sons of Ephraim" in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>; for it is evident that they were generations <span class="accented">succeeding</span> Shuthelah. Now, Ephraim was born in Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>), so that, on the above showing, the actual sons of Ephraim must have made some incursion from Egypt into the territories of the settled or possibly aboriginal inhabitants of Gath, and met the fate over which Ephraim so mourned. Such excursions on the part of the Israelites out of Egypt have very little collateral evidence. But there would seem to be no impossibility in the matter, considering <a href="../../par/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13-23</a>. Next, vers. 23-27 seem to say that in his sorrow Ephraim has another son, whom he names Beriah, and of whose line in the ninth descent comes Joshua, the son of Nun. This also is very doubtful. It may very possibly be that the parenthesis continues to the end of ver. 23 or 24, and that vers. 25-27 carry on the generations from ver. 21. Meantime welcome light breaks in at the stage (ver. 26) at which Ammihud and Elishama are mentioned. For we find these immediate ancestors of the great Joshua repeatedly mentioned at the period of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/7-48.htm">Numbers 7:48</a>, etc.); yet none of these places assist us to say that he did or did not come through Beriah. It is impossible to solve with any certainty the involved question of chronology and genealogy presented by this section. The passage is evidently mutilated and corrupt, though vindicating a high antiquity. Avery original presentation of the whole section, as ingenious as it is conjectural, by Lord A.C. Hervey, may be found in the art. "Shuthclah," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1305. It is well worthy of attention that a great point is made in bringing Joshua to the place of the eighth generation from Joseph, in near analogy with the numbers in so many other known cases, of the generations that intervened from the descent into Egypt to the entrance into Canaan. There also may be found the most and best that can be said against the literal reading of what is here written respecting the men of Gath and the cattle.

Forty years later (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-44.htm">Numbers 26:44-47</a>; comp. ver. 2) the number was fifty-three thousand four hundred. But it is supposed that the twenty-six thousand of this verse may refer only to a portion of the tribe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the large and distinguished family of Heber. It is to be noticed that the name of the tribe of Asher is not found in the list of the "chief rulers" lower down in this book (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16-22</a>).

Authorities are very divided as to whether this expression describes inhabitants of the land before the Captivity or subsequent to it. Almost all the older authorities, and Keil amongst those of more modern date, take the former position; Movers, Bertheau, and others take the latter, as also Canon Rawlinson ('Speaker's Commentary,' 3:157, 211). It must be admitted that there is some obscurity, and which accounts for the contrariety of opinion. But obscurity and contrariety notwithstanding, a comparison of vers. 2 and 3 with <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a>: produces two impressions almost irresistible, viz. that the difficulty is occasioned by some comparatively slight corruption or mutilation in our ver. 2; and that, whatever the reference is in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a> (and there is no ambiguity there), that it is in the present passage. The fourfold classification intends the <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> <span class="accented">people</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>), the <span class="cmt_word">priests</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Levites</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Nethinims</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those <span class="accented">given</span> as helpers of the priests, bond-men of the temple (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-47.htm">Numbers 31:47</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-48</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-17.htm">Ezra 8:17, 20</a>). Not before the time of the return does the name Nethinim seem to have crystallized upon this class of helpers, the explanation of which may possibly be that their numbers and their services then became so much more necessary. To this classification is added in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>, "And the children of Solomon's servants" (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55</a>).

These are descriptions of "service," not synonymous with those of vers. 17 and 18, where the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> are found, in place of those used here, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>.
