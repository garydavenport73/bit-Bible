Darius, the son of Hystaspes, was the first to do this (Herod., 3:89); but, as the tribute had to be rearranged from time to time (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>, 6:42), any subsequent Persian monarch who made a fresh arrangement might be said to "lay a tribute on the land." Xerxes is not unlikely to have done so after his return from Greece, as he had lost portions of his territories. <span class="cmt_word">And on the islands of the sea</span>. The Hebrew expression translated by "islands of the sea" includes maritime tracts. Xerxes by the Greek expedition lost the islands of the AEgean, but still held certain tracts upon the coast of Europe, which were occupied for a considerable time by Persian garrisons (Herod., 7:106, 107). These would necessarily be included in any assessment that he may have made, and it is even not unlikely that Xerxes would lay his assessment on the AEgean islands, though he might not be able to collect it.

These are unknown to us. After the failure of the Grecian expedition Xerxes attempted nothing further on that side of his empire, and the Greeks consequently record nothing more concerning him. He may have made expeditions in other directions.

It is indicative of the intimate connection of the two Iranian empires that one "book" contained the records of both. The fact of the connection is fully established by profane history. Its exact nature is not perhaps even yet fully understood. "Media" seems to be placed before "Persia" in this place on chronological grounds, because the Median history preceded the Persian history, and was therefore recorded first in the "book."

Ahasuerus, in the original <span class="accented">Akhashverosh</span>, corresponds to <span class="accented">Khshayarsha</span> (the Persian name from which the Greeks formed their Xerxes) almost as closely as possible. The prosthelic a was a necessity of Hebrew articulation. The only unnecessary change was the substitution of <span class="accented">v</span> for <span class="accented">y</span> (<span class="accented">vau</span> for <span class="accented">yod</span>) in the penultimate syllable. But this interchange is very common in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">This is Ahasuerus which reigned, etc</span>. The writer is evidently acquainted with more than a single Ahasuerus. Ezra had mentioned one (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>), and Daniel another (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>). If he knew their works, he would necessarily know of these two. Or he may have known of them independently. The Ahasuerus of his narrative being different from either, he proceeds to distinguish him <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Daniel, as a "king," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Ezra by the extent of his dominion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cambyses (see comment on Ezra 4:6) had not ruled over India. India is expressed by <span class="accented">Hoddu</span>, which seems formed from the Persian <span class="accented">Hidush</span> ('Nakhsh-i-Rus-tam Inser.,' par. 3, 1. 25), by the omission of the nominatival ending, and a slight modification of the vocalisation. The Sanscrit and the Zend, like the Greek, retained the <span class="accented">n</span>, which is really an essential part of the native word. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopia</span> is expressed, as usual, by <span class="accented">Cush</span>. The two countries are well chosen as the extreme <span class="accented">terminal</span> of the Persian empire. <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and twenty-seven provinces</span>. The Hebrew <span class="accented">medinah</span>, "province," does not correspond to the Persian satrapy, but is applied to every tract which had its own governor. There were originally no more than twenty satrapies (Herod., 3:89-94), but there was certainly a very much larger number of governments. Judaea was a <span class="accented">medinah</span> (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>), though only a small part of the satrapy of Syria. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-2.htm">Esther 1:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>That</i> in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which <i>was</i> in Shushan the palace,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan</span>. Though the Persian court resided a part of the year at Ecbatana, and occasionally visited Persepolis and Babylon (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:6, &sect; 2; 'Anab.,' 3:5, &sect; 15), yet Susa was decidedly the ordinary seat of government, and ranked as the capital of the empire (see Herod., 3:49; AEschyl., 'Pers.,' 11. 122, 123; Ctes., 'Exe. Pers.,' <span class="accented">pessim</span>, etc.). "Shushan <span class="cmt_word">the palace"</span> is distinguished from Shushan the city (<a href="../../par/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>), the one occupying a lofty but artificial eminence towards the west, while the other lay at the base of this mound, stretching out a considerable distance towards the east.

In  <span class="date">B.C. 483</span>, probably in the early spring, when the court, having spent the winter at Babylon (Xenophon), returned to Susa to enjoy the most charming season of the year. <span class="cmt_word">He made a feast unto all his princes and his servants</span>. Persian kings, according to Ctesias and Duris, ordinarily entertained at their table 15,000 persons! This is of course an exaggeration; but there can be no doubt that their hospitality was on a scale unexampled in modern times. The vast pillared halls of the Persepelitan and Susan palaces could accommodate many hundreds, if not thousands. <span class="cmt_word">The power of Persia and Media</span>. The empire of the Achaemenian kings was Perso-Medic rather than simply Persian. The Medes were not only the most favoured of the conquered nations, but were really placed nearly on a par with their conquerors. Many of the highest offices were conferred on them, and they formed no doubt a considerable section of the courtiers. <span class="cmt_word">The nobles</span>. Literally, "the first men," <span class="accented">ha-partemim.</span> The word used is a Persian term Hebraised. It occurs only in this place. <span class="cmt_word">And princes of the provinces</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> satraps. The presence of such persons at the great gathering at Susa preparatory to the Grecian war is witnessed to by Herodotus (7:19). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, <i>even</i> an hundred and fourscore days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he showed the riches</span>. Ostentation was a main feature in the character of Xerxes. The huge army with which he invaded Greece was more for display than for service. Vain parade is apparent at every step of his expedition (Herod., 7:31, 40, 41, 44, 59, etc.). He now exhibits "the riches of his kingdom" to his nobles and chief officers, showing them doubtless all the splendours of the palace, the walls draped with gold (AEschyl., 'Pers.,' 50:161), the marble pillars and rich hangings, the golden plane tree and the golden vine (Herod., 7:27), and perhaps the ingots of gold wherewith Darius had filled the treasury (ibid. 3:96). <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and fourscore days</span>. We need not suppose that the same persons were enter. tained during the whole of this period. All the provincial governors could not quit their provinces at the same time, nor could any of them remain away very long. There was no doubt a succession of guests during the six months that the entertainment lasted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A feast unto all the people that were found in Susa</span>. The males only are intended, as appears from ver. 9. So Cyrus on one occasion feasted "the entire Persian army," slaughtering for them all his father's flocks, sheep, goats, and oxen (Herod., 1:126). <span class="cmt_word">In the court of the garden</span>. The "court of the garden" is probably the entire space surrounding the central hall of thirty-six pillars at Susa, including the three detached porticoes of twelve pillars each, described by Mr. Loftus in his 'Chaldaea and Susiana' (pp. 365-372). This is a space nearly 350 feet long by 250 wide, with a square of 145 feet taken out of it for the central building. The area exceeds 60,000 square feet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Where were</i> white, green, and blue, <i>hangings</i>, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds <i>were of</i> gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where were white, green, and blue hangings</span>. There is nothing in the original corresponding to "green." The "hangings," or rather awning, was of white cotton (<span class="accented">karphas</span>) and violet. Mr. Loftus supposes that it was carried across from the central pillared hall to the detached porticoes, thus shading the guests from the intense heat of the sun ('Chaldaea and Susiana,' p. 375). <span class="cmt_word">Fastened with cords of fine linen and purple</span>. Very strong cords would be needed to support the awning if it was carried across as above suggested, over a space of nearly sixty feet. <span class="cmt_word">To rings of silver</span>. The exact use of the rings is doubtful. Perhaps they were inserted into the stone work in order that the cords might be made fast to them. <span class="cmt_word">Pillars of marble</span>. The pillars at Susa are not of marble, but of a dark-blue limestone. Perhaps the Hebrew <span class="accented">shesh</span> designated this stone rather than marble. <span class="cmt_word">The beds were of gold and silver</span>. The couches on which the guests reclined are intended (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>). These were either covered with gold and silver cloth, or had their actual framework of the precious metals, like those which Xerxes took with him into Greece (see Herod., 9:82). <span class="cmt_word">Upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.</span> The four words which follow "pavement" are not adjectives denoting colours, but the names of four different materials. One is <span class="accented">shesh</span>, the material of the pillars, which accords with the fact that such pavement slabs as have been found at Susa are, like the columns, of a blue limestone. The other materials are unknown to us, and we cannot say what the exact colours were; but no doubt the general result was a mosaic pavement of four different hues. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-7.htm">Esther 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">And they gave <i>them</i> drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They gave them drink in vessels of gold</span>. Drinking-vessels of gold were found in considerable numbers in the Persian camp near Plataea (Herod., 9:80) when the Greeks took it. They had been the property of Persian nobles. The king would naturally possess in great abundance whatever luxury was affected by the upper class of his subjects. <span class="cmt_word">The vessels being diverse one from another</span>. This is a minute point, which must have come from an eye-witness, or from one who had received the account of the banquet from an eye-witness. It was perhaps unusual. At least, in the grand banquet represented by Sargon on the walls of his palace at Khorsabad, it is observable that all the guests hold in their hands goblets which are exactly alike (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">Royal</span> <span class="cmt_word">wine</span>. Literally, "wine of the kingdom" - wine, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the royal cellar, and therefore good wine, but not necessarily the "wine of Helbon, which was the only wine that the king himself drank (Athen., 'Deipnosoph,' 4. p. 145, A). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the drinking <i>was</i> according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The drinking was according to the law</span>. Rather, "according to <span class="accented">edict"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> the edict being the express order given by the king to all the officers of his household. It is implied that the usual custom was different - that the foolish practice prevailed of compelling men to drink. That the Persians were hard drinkers, and frequently drank to excess, is stated by Herodotus (1:133) and Xenophon ('Cyrop.,' 8:8, &sect; 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women <i>in</i> the royal house which <i>belonged</i> to king Ahasuerus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vashti, the queen</span>. The only wife of Xerxes known to the Greeks was Amestris, the daughter of Otanes, one of the seven conspirators (Herod., 7:61). Xerxes probably took her to wife as soon as he was of marriageable age, and before he ascended the throne had a son by her, who in his seventh year was grown up (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 9:108). It would seem to be certain that if Ahasuerus is Xerxes, Vashti must be Amestris. The names themselves are not very remote, since will readily interchange with <span class="accented">v</span>; but Vashti might possibly represent not the real name of the queen, but a favourite epithet, such as <span class="accented">vahista</span>, "<span class="accented">sweetest."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Made a feast for the women</span>. Men and women did not take their meals together in Persia unless in the privacy of domestic life (Brisson, 'De Regn. Pers.,' 2. pp. 273-276). If the women, therefore, were to partake in a festivity, it was necessary that they should be entertained separately. In the royal house. In the gynaeceum or harem, which was probably on the southern side of the great pillared hall at Susa (Fergusson). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:10-22 THE DISGRACE OF VASHTI (<a href="../../par/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10-22</a>). On the seventh day of the feast "to all in Shushan" (ver. 5), the king having excited himself with drink, took it into his head to send a message to Vashti, requiring her to make her appearance in the banquet of the men, since he desired to exhibit her beauty to the assembled guests, as "she was fair to look on" (ver. 11). His design must have been to present her unveiled to the coarse admiration of a multitude of semi-drunken revellers, in order that they might envy him the possession of so lovely a wife. Such a proceeding was a gross breach of Persian etiquette, and a cruel outrage upon one whom he above all men was bound to protect. Vashti, therefore, declined to obey (ver. 12). Preferring the risk of death to dishonour, she braved the anger of her despotic lord, and sent him back a message by his chamberlains that she would not come. We can well understand that to an absolute monarch such a rebuff, in the face of his whole court and of some hundreds or thousands of assembled guests, must have been exasperating in the extreme. At the moment when he had thought to glorify himself by a notable display of his omnipotence, he was foiled, defeated, made a laughing-stock to all Susa. "Therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him." It is to his credit that, being thus fiercely enraged, he did not proceed to violence, but so far restrained himself as to refer the matter to the judgment of others, and ask the "<span class="accented">seven</span> princes" the question, "What is to be done according to law unto queen Vashti, for not performing the commandment of the king?" (ver. 15). The advice of the princes, uttered by one of their body (vers. 16-20), and assented to by the remainder (ver. 21), was, that Yashti should be degraded from the position of queen, and her place given to another. This sentence was supported by specious arguments based upon expediency, and ignoring entirely the outrageous character of the king's command, which was of course the real, and sole, justification of Vashti's disobedience. It was treated as a simple question of the wife's duty to obey her husband, and the husband's right to enforce submission. Ahasuerus, as might be expected, received the decision of his obsequious counsellors with great satisfaction, and forthwith sent letters into all the provinces of his vast empire, announcing what had been done, and requiring wives everywhere to submit themselves unreservedly to the absolute rule of their lord (ver. 22).

At other times he did as he pleased, but probably generally drank reason was somewhat obscured. <span class="cmt_word">Mehuman</span>, etc. Persian etymologies have been given for most of these names, but they are all more or less uncertain; and as eunuchs were often foreigners, mutilated for the Persian market (Herod., 3:93; 8:105), who bore foreign names, like the Hermotimus of Herodotus (8:104-106), it is quite possible that Persian etymologies may here be out of place. <span class="cmt_word">Bigtha</span>, however, if it be regarded as a shortened form of Bigthan (<a href="../../par/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a>) or Bigthana (ch. 6.), would seem to be Persian, being equivalent to <span class="accented">Bagadana</span> (  =  Theodorus), "the gift of God." <span class="cmt_word">Chamberlains</span>. Really, as in the margin, "eunuchs." The influence of eunuchs at the Persian court was great from the time of Xerxes. Ctesias makes them of importance even from the time of Cyrus ('Exc. Pera,' &sect; 5, 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-11.htm">Esther 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she <i>was</i> fair to look on.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vashti ... with the crown royal.</span> We have no representation of a Persian queen among the sculptures; but Mousa, a Parthian queen, appears on a coin of her son Phraataces ('Sixth Oriental Monarchy,' p. 220), crowned with a very elaborate tiara. It consists of a tall stiff cap, not unlike the <span class="accented">cidaris</span> of a Persian king, but is apparently set with large jewels. Vashti's "crown royal" was probably not very dissimilar. <span class="cmt_word">To show the princes and the people her beauty</span>. More than one Oriental monarch is reported to have desired to have his own opinion of his wife's beauty confirmed by the judgment of others. Candaules, king of Lydia, is said to have lost his crown and his life through imprudently indulging this desire (Herod., 1:8-12). So public an exposure, however, as that designed by Ahasuerus is not recorded of any other monarch, and would scarcely have been attempted by any one less extravagant in his conduct than Xerxes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-12.htm">Esther 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by <i>his</i> chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the queen Vashti refused</span>. Vashti's refusal was morally quite justifiable. Neither a husband's nor a king's authority extends to the wanton requirement of acts that, if done, would disgrace the doer for life. Had Vashti complied, she would have lost the respect not only of the Persian nation, but of the king himself. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore was the king very wroth</span>. Had Ahasuerus really loved his wife, or been a man of fair and equitable disposition, be would have excused her refusal, and felt that he had deserved the rebuff. But, not really loving her, and being of a hot and ungovernable temper, he was violently enraged with her, as he always was when anything fell out contrary to his wishes (see Herod., 7:11, 35, 39, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so <i>was</i> the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king said to the wise men</span>. Angry as he was, Ahasuerus had still some power of self-restraint. He was in the presence of his whole court, and of a great assembly of the people. It would not be seemly that he should vent his passion in violent words, imprecations, or threats. His dignity required that he should at any rate seem calm, and, instead of issuing any hasty order, should proceed deliberately to consider what were the next steps to be taken. Xerxes appears to have been rather fond of asking advice (Herod., 7:8, 48, 234; 8:101); and he now, in a sufficiently dignified way, required the opinion of his "wise men" on the practical question, What was to be done to Vashti? (see ver. 15<span class="cmt_word">). Which knew the times</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> persons who were well acquainted with past times, and knew what it was customary to do on each occasion<span class="cmt_word">. For so was the king's manner toward all that ]mew law and judgment</span>. Rather, "For so was the business of the king brought before such as knew law and judgment." Each matter which concerned the king was submitted to learned persons for their opinion before any actual step was taken (compare Herod., 3:31, where Cambyses asks the opinion of the royal judges with respect to his proposed marriage with his sister). It is not a special practice of Ahasuerus, but a general usage of the Persian monarchy, which m noticed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the next unto him <i>was</i> Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, <i>and</i> Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, <i>and</i> which sat the first in the kingdom;)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar</span>, etc. The chief native advisers of Xerxes in the early part of his reign appear to have been Mardonius (Pera <span class="accented">Marduniya</span>) and Artabanus (Pers, <span class="accented">Artapana</span>), who was his uncle (Herod., 7:5-17). It is possible that Mardonius may be here represented by <span class="cmt_word">Marsena</span>, and Artabanus by <span class="cmt_word">Admatha</span>; but the names could only have taken these shapes by a large amount of corruption. The other form have a general Persian air, but do not admit of even conjectural identification. <span class="cmt_word">The seven princes of Persia and Media</span>. Ezra assigns to the Persian monarch seven special counsellors (Esther 7:14), and Herodotus says that there were seven leading families in Persia whose heads were specially privileged (3:84). The title, however, "princes of Persia and <span class="accented">Media</span>," is not found anywhere but here. <span class="cmt_word">Which saw the king's face</span>. Among the privileges said by Herodotus to have been reserved to the heads of the great families, one of the most valued was that of free access to the monarch at all times, unless he were in the seraglio.

Literally, "According to law, what is there to do to queen Vashti?" Law is given the prominent place, as though the king would say, Let us put aside feeling, and simply consider what the law is. If a queen disobeys the king openly in the face of his court, what, according to law, is to be done to her? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that <i>are</i> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Memucan answered</span>. We gather from Memucan's reply that the Persian law had provided no penalty for the case in hand - had, in fact, not contemplated it. He first argues the matter on general grounds of morality (ver. 16) and expediency (vers. 17, 18), and then proposes the enactment of a new law - a <span class="accented">privilegium -</span> assigning Vashti a special punishment for her contempt of the king's order. The "<span class="accented">decree"</span> (ver. 20) would not have been necessary had there already existed a law on the point. <span class="cmt_word">Vashti, the queen, hath not done wrong to the king only</span>. With the servility to be expected in an Oriental and a courtier, Memucan throws himself wholly on the king's side - insinuates no word of blame against his royal master, on whom in justice the whole blame rested; but sets himself to make the worst he can of Vashti's conduct, which (he says) was a wrong not to Ahasuerus only, but to the whole male population of the empire, the princes included, who must expect their wives to throw off all subjection, in imitation of the queen's example, if her conduct were allowed to go unpunished. As such a condition of things would be intolerable, the king is urged to disgrace her publicly.

Translate the whole passage as follows: <span class="accented">-</span> "Likewise shall the princesses of Persia and Media, which have heard of the deed of the queen, say this day to all the king's princes." Not only will the wives of the common people get hold of the story, and quote Vashti's example as often as they wish to disobey their husbands, but <span class="accented">our own</span> wives too will disobey us on the same pretext, and will begin forthwith "this day." <span class="cmt_word">Too much contempt and wrath</span>.

Literally, "a command of the kingdom" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a public, not a domestic, order. Under ordinary circumstances such a matter as the disgrace of a favourite wife would have been settled in the secrecy of the seraglio, without calling general attention to it. In Memu-can's opinion, the publicity of Vashti's disobedience had made it expedient that she should be disgraced publicly. <span class="cmt_word">Let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes</span>. A sentence upon an individual was not a very suitable thing to add to a national code of laws; but we see from Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8, 9</a>) that decrees of quite a temporary character were sometimes attached to the code for the express purpose of rendering them unalterable; and so it seems to have been in this instance. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">another</span>. Literally, as in the margin, "unto her companion." Memucan assumes that one of the existing inmates of the seraglio will be elevated into the place vacated by Vashti. This was the ordinary course, but on the present occasion was not followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's decree</span>. The "commandment" of the preceding verse is here given the formal name of <span class="accented">pithgam</span>, "decree," which is a Persian word, used also in Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-7.htm">Ezra 5:7, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For it is great</span>. These words seem at first sight superfluous. Perhaps their force is this - Let a decree be made, and then, great as the empire is, the lesson will be taught to all: otherwise there will be many to whom it will never penetrate.

This expression must not be pressed too closely. It does not imply more than that Memucan's advice was followed in a general way - Vashti disgraced, and the grounds of her disgrace published throughout the provinces. We cannot be sure that the decree was "written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes." Even if it was, it was always possible for a Persian king to give himself a dispensation from the law (see Herod., 3:58).

This is a phrase peculiar to the Book of Esther, and a favourite one with the author (see vers. 15, 17; and <a href="../../par/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>).

To have confessed that she was a Jewess would probably have roused a prejudice against her, or at any rate have prevented her from being received with special favour. Mordecai, knowing this, had instructed her to say nothing to Hegel on the subject, and no one else, it would seem, had enlightened him.

Mordecai seems to have been one of the porters at the main entrance to the palace, and his proper place was at the gateway. He contrived, however, during some part of each day to visit the court in front-of the seraglio, in order to see Esther, or at any rate obtain intelligence concerning her.

A year's purification was considered necessary before any maiden could approach the king (see the comment on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Six months with oil of myrrh</span>. Myrrh was highly esteemed, both for its scent and for its purifying power, by the ancients. In Egypt it was employed largely in the preparation of mummies (Herod., 2:86). The Jews were directed to make it one of the chief ingredients in their "holy anointing oil" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>). Dresses and beds were scented with it (<a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And six months with sweet odours</span>.

The meaning is, that on quitting the house of the women for the king's apartments, each maiden was entitled to demand anything that she liked in the way of dress or ornament, and it had to be given her. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span>.

As the Pseudo-Smerdis had done when he usurped the throne (Herod., 3:67). A "release" was an exemption from taxation, or from military service, or from both, for a specified period. <span class="cmt_word">And gave gifts, according to the state of the king</span>. Literally, that is, "in right royal fashion" (see <a href="../../par/esther/1-7.htm">Esther 1:7</a>). The practice of making presents, so common in the East at all times, was much in vogue among the Persians, and was practised especially by the monarchs (Herod., 1:136; 3:135; 7:26; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:2, &sect; 7, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; 'Anab.,' 1:9, &sect; 22, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:19-23 MORDECAI'S DISCOVERY OF A PLOT AGAINST AHASUERUS' LIFE (<a href="../../par/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19-23</a>). Some time after Esther had been made queen, there was a second collection of virgins at Susa (ver. 19), under circumstances which are not related, and which were probably of small importance. <span class="accented">At this time</span> (ver. 21) Mordecai, still serving in his humble office at the palace gate, from which he had not been advanced, since Esther had told no one that he was her relation (ver. 20), happened to detect a conspiracy against the king's life, which had been formed by two of the palace eunuchs, Bigthan and Tercsh, whom Ahasuerus had somehow offended (ver. 21). Being still in the habit of holding communication with Esther, Mordecai was able to make her acquainted with the facts, of which she then informed the king, telling him how she had obtained her knowledge (ver. 22). There was nothing surprising or suspicious in a eunuch of the palace having had speech with the queen, especially when he had intelligence of such importance to impart to her. On inquiry, the king found that Mordecai's information was correct; the conspiracy was laid bare, and the conspirators put to death (ver. 23) - the facts being, as was sure to be the case, entered in the court chronicle, a daily record of the life of the court, and of the circumstances that befell the king. It was to have been expected that Mordecai would have been rewarded for his zeal; but somehow or other it happened that his services were overlooked he was neither promoted from his humble office, nor did he receive any gift (<a href="../../par/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a>). This was quite contrary to ordinary Persian practice; but the court generally may have disliked Mordecai because he was a Jew. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the virgins were gathered together</span>. Rather, "When virgins." There is no article. The fact seems to be mentioned simply as furnishing a date, and we must suppose both that there was a second gathering, and that the time when it happened was generally known to the Jews and Persians. Then Mordecai sat, etc. The three verses, 19, 20, 21, hang together, and form a single sentence: "When virgins were gathered together a second time, and Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate - now Esther had not showed her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the command of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with him - in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, being of the number of them which kept the threshold, were wroth," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-20.htm">Esther 2:20</a></div><div class="verse">Esther had not <i>yet</i> shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Esther had not yet showed</span>, etc. This is inserted to account for the humble position still occupied by Mordecai. In the East a person's relations usually rise with him; and the reader would naturally expect that when Esther was once queen, Mordecai would have become rich and great. Esther's silence accounts for Mordecai's low estate; Mordecai's command (see ver. 10) accounts for Esther's silence<span class="cmt_word">. For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai</span>. The royal dignity did not change Esther's heart. She was still the dutiful child she had been so many years. Mordecai had forbidden her to tell her kindred; he had not removed his prohibition, so she had kept silence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days</span>. Or, "at that time" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the time when the second gathering of the virgins took place (see ver. 19<span class="cmt_word">). Two of the king's chamberlains</span>. Rather, "eunuchs." Bigthan, or Bigthana (<a href="../../par/esther/6-2.htm">Esther 6:2</a>), is probably the same name as the Bigtha of <a href="../../par/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>, and possibly the same personage. <span class="cmt_word">Teresh</span> is not mentioned elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Of those which kept the door</span>. Two of the eunuchs who guarded the entrance to the king's sleeping apartment. This was a position of the highest possible trust, and gave conspirators a terrible advantage. Xerxes actually lost his life through a conspiracy formed by Artabanus, the captain of his guard, with Aspamitras, a eunuch and chamberlain (Ctes., 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 29). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told <i>it</i> unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king <i>thereof</i> in Mordecai's name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the thing was known unto Mordecai</span>. Josephus says that a certain Pharnabazus, a slave of one of the conspirators, betrayed them to Mordecai ('Ant. Jud.,' 14:6, &sect; 4). One of the Targums on Esther attributes his discovery of the plot to his knowledge of languages. But it is probable that these are mere guesses. <span class="cmt_word">And Esther certified the king thereof</span>. The original is simpler, "And Esther told it to the king." <span class="cmt_word">In Mordecai's name</span>. Mordecai's name thus came first before the king. Esther mentioned him as her informant, but did not say that he was related to her (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/8-1.htm">Esther 8:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was found out</span>. The subsequent history shows that Mordecai's information was found to be correct, since he was ultimately adjudged to have deserved the highest possible reward (<a href="../../par/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6-10</a>). The two conspirators were condemned to death and <span class="cmt_word">hanged on a tree</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> crucified or impaled, as traitors and rebels commonly were in Persia (see Herod., 3 159; 4:43; 'Behist.

We find them noting down facts for Xerxes at Doriscus (Herod., 7:100), and again at Salamis (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:90). They kept a record something like the <span class="accented">acta diurna</span> of the early Roman empire (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 13:31), and specially noted whatever concerned the king. Ctesias pretended to have drawn his Persian history from these "chronicles" (<span class="accented">up.</span> Diod.

No reason is assigned for this order, which was certainly unusual, since the prostration of an inferior before a superior was a general rule (Herod., 1:134).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he <i>was</i> a Jew.</div><div class="comm">

Apparently Mordecai's disrespect had not been observed by Haman until the "king's servants" called his attention to it. Then, naturally enough, he was greatly offended, and felt exceedingly angry at what seemed to him a gross impertinence. Mordecai's excuse did not pacify him - perhaps seemed to him to make the matter worse, since, if allowed, it would justify all the Jews in the empire in withholding from him the respect that he considered his due. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/3-6.htm">Esther 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that <i>were</i> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>even</i> the people of Mordecai.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone</span>. If Haman had simply said to Ahasuerus, "There is one of your menials who persistently disobeys a royal edict, and at the same time insults me," Ahasuerus would, as a matter of course, have told him to put the menial to death. But the revengeful temper of the man was such that this seemed to him insufficient. Mordecai had insulted him as a Jew, and the Jews should pay the penalty. Mordecai should be punished not only in person, but in his kindred, if he had any, and in his nation. The nation itself was contumacious and troublesome (ver. 8); it would be well to get rid of it. And it would be a grand thing to wipe out an insult offered by an individual in the blood of a whole people. Haman therefore <span class="cmt_word">sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus</span>. Massacres on a large scale - not unknown in the West, witness St. Bartholomew's - are of frequent occurrence in the East, where human life is not held in much regard, and the caprices of absolute monarchs determine the course of history. There had been a general massacre of the Magi upon the accession of Darius Hystaspis, the father of Xerxes (Herod., 3:79), and one of Scythians about a century before (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 1.106). These were examples which might occur to Haman. A later one is the Roman massacre of Mithridates in  <span class="date">B.C. 88</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:7-15 HAMAN CASTS LOTS TO OBTAIN A LUCKY DAY FOR HIS ENTERPRISE, AND OBTAINS A DAY IN THE MONTH ADAR, THE LAST MONTH OF THE YEAR (<a href="../../par/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>). Having determined on a general massacre of the Jews on a given day, as the best mode of ridding the empire of them, Haman thought it of supreme importance, to select for the massacre a propitious and fortunate day. Lucky and unlucky days are recognised generally throughout the East; and it is a wide-spread practice, when any affair of consequence is taken in hand, to obtain a determination of the time for commencing it, or carrying it into effect, by calling in the arbitrement of Chance. Haman had recourse to "the lot," and by means of it obtained, as the fight day for his purpose, the 13th of Adar, which was more than ten months distant. The long delay was no doubt unpalateable, but he thought himself bound to submit to it, and took his further measures accordingly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">In the first month, that <i>is</i>, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that <i>is</i>, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, <i>to</i> the twelfth <i>month</i>, that <i>is</i>, the month Adar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first month, the month Nisan</span>. See the comment on Nehemiah 2:1. This name was first given to the month by the Jews after the return from the captivity. It was the Babylonian name of the first month of the year, and superseded the old Jewish name, Abib<span class="cmt_word">. The twelfth year of...  Ahasuerus</span> -  <span class="date">B.C. 474</span>, if Ahasuerus be Xerxes<span class="cmt_word">. They cast Pur, that is, the lot</span>. The superstitious use of lots has always been prevalent in the East, and continues to the present day. Lots were drawn, or thrown, m various ways: sometimes by means of dice, sometimes by slips of wood, or strips of parchment or paper, and also in other manners. Even the Jews supposed a special Providence to preside over the casting of lots (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>), and thought that matters decided in this way were decided by God. Haman appears to have cast lots, first, as to the day of the month which he should fix for the massacre, and secondly as to the month in which it should take place. Apparently the lot fell out for the thirteenth day (ver. 13), and for the twelfth month, the last month in the year. The word "Pur" is not Hebrew it is supposed to be Old Persian, and to be connected with Mod. Pers. <span class="accented">pareh</span>, Lat<span class="accented">. pars</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. To the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. Adar is, like Nisan, a Babylonian word, perhaps connected with <span class="accented">edder</span>, "splendour." The month so named corresponded nearly with March, when the sun begins to have great power in Western Asia. HAMAN PERSUADES AHASUERUS TO PUBLISH A DECREE COMMANDING THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THE JEWS IN HIS KINGDOM ON THE ENSUING THIRTEENTH DAY OF ADAR (<a href="../../par/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8-15</a>). Having formed his own resolve, it remained for Haman to bring his proposal before Ahasuerus in such a shape as should secure his acquiescence in it. For this purpose he thought it best, first, to raise a prejudice against the Jews by representing them as bad subjects, causing trouble through the peculiarity of their own laws, and still more through their unwillingness to render obedience to the Persian laws (ver. 8). In support of this last statement he would no doubt, if questioned, have adduced the conduct of Mordecai, who persisted in "transgressing the king's commandment," and gave as his only reason that he was a Jew, and therefore could not obey it (ver. 4). As, however, he doubted the effect of this reasoning on his royal master, he held in reserve an argument of another kind, an appeal to the king's cupidity, which constituted his main reliance. If the king gave his consent to the destruction of the Jewish nation, Haman undertook to pay into the royal treasuries, out of his private means, a sum which cannot be estimated at much less than two millions and a quarter of pounds sterling, and which may have amounted to a much higher figure (ver. 9). The effect of this argument upon Ahasuerus was decisive; he at once took his signet-ring from his finger, and made it over to his minister (ver. 10), thus enabling him to promulgate any decree that he pleased, and he openly declared that he gave over the Jewish nation, their lives and properties, into Haman's hands (ver. 11). Haman "struck while the iron was hot." The king's scribes were put in requisition  -  a decree was composed, numerous copies of it made, the royal seal am,ca to each (ver. 12), and a copy despatched forthwith to each governor of a province by the royal post, ordering the complete destruction of the Jews within his province, young and old, men, women, and children, on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and the confiscation of their property (ver. 13). The posts started off with all speed, "being hastened by the king's commandment" (ver. 15); and the two men who had plotted a nation's extermination, as if they had done a good day's work, and deserved refreshment, "sat down to drink." But the Persians generally were less satisfied with the decree than their monarch and his minister; it surprised and startled them; "the city Shushan was perplexed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws <i>are</i> diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it <i>is</i> not for the king's profit to suffer them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed</span>. It is not always borne in mind how large a part of the Jewish nation remained in the lands to which they had been carried away captive, after the permission had been given to return. Josephus notes that the richer and more influential of the Babylonian Jews were very little inclined to quit Babylon ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). There was evidently a large Jewish colony at Susa (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>). The Book of Tobit shows that Israelites, scarcely to be distinguished from Jews, were settled in Rhages and Ecbatana. The present passage is important as showing the early <span class="accented">wide</span> dispersion of the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Their laws are diverse</span>. A true charge, but a weak argument for their destruction, more especially as the Persians allowed all the conquered nations to retain their own laws and usages. <span class="cmt_word">Neither keep they the king's laws</span>. Important, if true. But it was not true in any broad and general sense. There might be an occasional royal edict which a Jew could not obey; but the laws of the Medes and Persians were in the main righteous laws, and the Jews readily observed them. They were faithful and loyal subjects of the Achaemenian monarchs from first to last from Cyrus to Darius Codomannus. <span class="cmt_word">For the king's profit</span>. Rather, as in the margin, "meet" or "fitting for the king." <span class="cmt_word">To suffer them</span>. Or, "to let them alone."

Xerxes had once, if we may trust Herodotus, declined to accept from a subject a gift of money equal to about four and a half million of pounds sterling (Herod., 7:28); but this was early in his reign, when his treasury was full, and he had not exhausted his resources by the Greek war. Now, in his comparative poverty, a gift of from two to three millions had attractions for him which proved irresistible<span class="cmt_word">. To the hands of those that have the charge of the business</span>. Not the business of the slaughter, but the business of receiving money for the king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the royal treasurers. <span class="cmt_word">To bring it</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">for them</span> to bring it," or pay it, "into the royal treasuries."

Rather, "took his <span class="accented">signet</span> from his hand." This may have been a ring, for signet-rings were known to the Persians, but is perhaps more likely to have been a cylinder, like that of Darius, his father, which is now in the British Museum ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. p. 182). <span class="cmt_word">And gave it unto Haman</span>.

Not "the silver which thou hast given me is given back to thee," for the 10,000 talents had not been given, but only offered. Rather, "the silver of the people is given thee, together with the people themselves, to do with both as it pleases thee." Confiscation always accompanies execution in the East, and the goods of those who are put to death naturally escheat to the crown, which either seizes them or makes a grant of them. Compare ch. 8:11, where the property of those of the Jews' enemies who should suffer death is granted to those who should slay them.

Such persons were always near at hand in the palace, ready to draw up edicts. <span class="cmt_word">On the thirteenth day of the first month</span>. It is conjectured that Haman cast his lots on the first day of the year (Berthcau), as an auspicious time for taking anything in hand, and having obtained a <span class="accented">thirteenth</span> day for the massacre, adopted the same number as probably auspicious for the necessary appeal to the king.

All edicts were in the king's name, even when a subject had been allowed to issue them.

The Persian system of posts is thus described by Xenophon, who attributes its introduction to Cyrus: - "Stables for horses are erected along the various lines of route, at such a distance one from another as a horse can accomplish in a day. All the stables are provided with a number of horses and grooms. There is a post-master to preside over each, who receives the despatches along with the tired men and horses, and sends them on by fresh horses and fresh riders. Sometimes there is no stoppage in the conveyance even at night; since a night courier takes up the work of the day courier, and continues it. It has been said that these posts outstrip the flight of birds, which is not altogether true; but beyond a doubt it is the most rapid of all methods of conveyance by land" ('Cyrop.,' 8:6, &sect; 17). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish</span>. The writer quotes from the edict, which appears to have had as many surplus words as a modern English law paper. <span class="cmt_word">Young and old, little children and women</span>. "To take the father's life and spare the child's" was thought to be an act of folly in ancient times. Wives and children of criminals were, as a matter of course, put to death with them. This was anciently even the Jewish practice (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>), and was quite an established usage in Persia (Herod., 3:119). <span class="cmt_word">The thirteenth day</span>. The Septuagint has "the fourteenth day" in its professed copy of the decree, but confirms the Hebrew text here by making the thirteenth the actual day of the struggle (<a href="../../par/esther/9-1.htm">Esther 9:1</a>). The fourteenth and fifteenth are the days now kept by the Jews; but it is suspected that an alteration has been made in order to assimilate the Purim to the passover feast, which began on the 14th of Nisan.

The Jews had enemies in Susa (<a href="../../par/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>); but the bulk of the inhabitants being Persians, and so Zoroastrians, would be likely to sympathise with them. There might also be a widespread feeling among persons of other nationalities that the precedent now set was a dangerous one. Generally the people of the capital approved and applauded what. ever the great king did. Now they misdoubted the justice, and perhaps even the prudence, of what was resolved upon.

SHE CONSENTS TO RISK MAKING AN APPEAL TO THE KING (<a href="../../par/esther/4-4.htm">Esther 4:4-17</a>). Esther, in the seclusion of the harem, knew nothing of what the king and Haman had determined on. No one in the palace suspected how vitally she was concerned in the matter, since none knew that she was a Jewess, and state affairs are not commonly discussed between an Oriental monarch and a young wife. It was known, however, that she took an interest in Mordecai; and when that official was seen outside the palace gate in his mourning garb, it was reported to the queen. Not being aware why he grieved, but thinking that perhaps it was some light matter which he took too much to heart, she sent him a change of raiment, and requested him to put off his sackcloth. But Mordecai, without assigning any reason, refused (ver. 4). Esther upon this caused inquiry to be made of Mordecai concerning the reason of his mourning, and in this way became acquainted with what had happened (vers. 5-9). At the same time she found herself called on by Mordecai to incur a great danger, since he requested her to go at once to the king, and to intercede with him for her people (ver. 8). In reply, the queen pointed out the extreme risk which she would run in entering the royal presence uninvited, and the little chance that there was of her receiving a summons, since she had not had one for thirty days (ver. 11). Mordecai, however, was inexorable. He reminded Esther that she herself was threatened by the decree, and was not more likely to escape than any other Jew or Jewess; declared his belief that, if she withheld her aid, deliverance would arise from some other quarter; warned her that neglect of duty was apt to provoke a heavy retribution, and suggested that she might have been raised to her queenly dignity for the express purpose of her being thus able to save her nation (vers. 13, 14). The dutiful daughter, the true Jewess, could resist no longer; she only asked that Mordecai and the other Jews in Susa would fast for her three days, while she and her maidens also fasted, and then she would take her life in her hand, and enter the royal presence uninvited, though it was contrary to the law; the risk should be run, and then, as she said with a simple pathos never excelled, "if I perish, I perish" (ver. 16). Satisfied with this reply, Mordecai "went his way," and held the three days' fast which Esther had requested (ver. 17).

Rather, "there is one law for him. 'Whoever he be, there is one and the same law regarding him - he must suffer death.

No other writer tells us of this custom, but it is in perfect harmony with Oriental habits and modes of thought. Some have objected that the king would not always have a golden sceptre by him; but the Persepolitan sculptures uniformly represent him with a long tapering staff in his hand, which is probably the "sceptre" (<span class="accented">sharbith</span>) of Esther. <span class="cmt_word">I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days</span>. The king s passion had cooled, and Esther now, like his other wives, waited her occasional summons to his presence. She had not been called for a whole month, and did not know when a summons might come. It would not do to trust to so mere a chance; and therefore, if she was to interpose on behalf of her nation, she must intrude on the king uninvited, and risk being put to death.

Mordecai is confident that God will not allow the destruction of his people.

It has been supposed that Esther could not have meant an absolute fast - complete abstinence from both food and drink - for so long a period as three days; but Oriental abstemiousness would not be very severely taxed by a fast of this length.

This is certainly the meaning, though the elliptical phrase used is uncommon. Esther, while she fasted, had worn some garb of woe; now she laid it aside, and appeared once more in all the splendour of her royal robes. She took up her position directly in front of the king's apartment, with the object of attracting his attention, and perhaps with the knowledge that he was upon his throne, whence he could not fail to see her. <span class="cmt_word">The king sat upon his royal throne,  over against the gate</span>. In a Persian pillared hall the place for the throne would be at the further end, midway between the side walls. The throne would be elevated on steps, and would command a view down the midmost avenue of columns to the main entrance, which would commonly occupy that position.

This was, no doubt, the customary act by which the king's grace was, as it were, accepted and appropriated. It is analogous to that touch of the person or of the garments which secured the suppliant mercy among the Greeks.

Sometimes no limit at all is placed to the petitioner's liberty of choice - seldom any less wide limit than that of the present passage. According to Herodotus (9:111), there was one day in the year on which the king was bound to grant <span class="accented">any</span> request made by a guest at his table. <span class="cmt_word">To the half of the kingdom</span>.

Ordinarily the king and queen dined separately, each in their own apartments; family gatherings, however, not being unknown (Plut., 'Vit. Artaxerx.,' &sect; 5; Athen., 'Deipnsoph.,' 4. p. 145, A). But for the queen to invite not only the king, but also another male guest, not a relation, was a remarkable innovation, and must have seemed to the fortunate recipient of the invitation a high act of favour.

Ahasuerus has understood that it was not for the mere pleasure of entertaining himself and his prime minister at a banquet that Esther adventured her life.

Esther still hesitates to prefer her real request. We are not likely to be able in the nineteenth century to understand all the motives that actuated her, or all the workings of her mind. Perhaps nothing kept her back but the natural fear of a repulse, and a desire to defer the evil day; perhaps she saw some real advantage in putting off the determination of the matter. At any rate, she again declined to declare herself, and merely gave her two guests a second invitation for the ensuing evening.

AT THE BIDDING OF HIS WIFE HE RESOLVES TO IMPALE MORDECAI, AND CAUSES A LOFTY CROSS TO BE ERECTED FOR THE PURPOSE (<a href="../../par/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9-14</a>). The favour shown him by the king and queen in admitting him to the very close intimacy implied in their making him the sole companion of their private hours, produced in Haman a dangerous exaltation of spirit. He seemed to himself to have attained the pinnacle of a subject's greatness. Returning home in this frame of mind, and having to pass through the gate where Mordecai was on duty, he was more vexed than usual with that official's disrespect, which was more pointed and open than it had ever been before (ver. 9). However, he took no immediate notice of the porter's conduct (ver. 10), but proceeded to his own house, where he assembled his friends, and communicated to them, and at the same time to Zeresh his wife, the circumstances which had so greatly raised his spirits. The climax was that "Esther the queen had let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but himself; nay, more, he was again invited on the morrow to banquet with her and the king" (ver. 12). He added, however, Mordecai's insult remaining fresh in his recollection, that all his glory, all his honours, availed him nothing - were as nothing in his eyes - so long as he was condemned to see Mordecai the Jew every time that he passed though the palace gate, and to be treated by him with contempt and contumely (ver. 13). Upon this Zeresh made, and Haman's friends approved, a proposal that a lofty cross should be at once erected in the court of Haman's house, on which Mordecai should be impaled, with the king's consent, as soon as it was finished. Haman agreed to this, recovered his spirits, and gave orders for the cross to be made (ver. 14).

It poisoned his happiness, marred all his enjoyment, filled him with hatred and rage. When he came home, he sent and called for his friends. It was not so much to be partners in his joy that Haman called his friends around him as to be companions in his grief. It is true that his speech to them was chiefly occupied with boasts; but the true intention of the discourse is seen in its close - "All this availeth me nothing," etc.

Much less had he taught himself to look upon the vexations and trials of life as blessings in disguise. His was a coarse and undisciplined nature, little better than that of a savage, albeit he was the chief minister of the first monarch in the world.

In Persia, where "royal benefactors" formed a distinct class, and had their names inscribed on a special list (Herod., 8:85), it was especially incumbent on the monarch to see that every such person received a return proportioned to the value of his service. Ahasuerus seems to have supposed that some honour or dignity must have been conferred upon Mordecai, though he could not recollect what it was; and it is difficult to understand how the omission to reward him had occurred, unless there was a prejudice against him among the high court officials, who may have known that he was a Jew, though his fellow-servants did not (<a href="../../par/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a>).

Early morning is a common time for the transaction of business at an Eastern court. Haman was so anxious to get the business on which he was bent despatched, that he had come perhaps even before daybreak, and was waiting in the outer court, to get, if possible, the first audience. This haste of his to effect Mordecai's destruction led to his being the person deputed to do him the highest honour.

To wear a dress previously worn by the king was, under ordinary circumstances, a breach of Persian law (Plut., 'Vit.

Some peculiar ornament by which the royal steed was made conspicuous is intended, not his own crown, which even Xerxes would scarcely have allowed another to wear. See vers. 9 and 11, where the dress and the horse are referred to, but the crown, as an adjunct of the horse, not particularised. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man <i>withal</i> whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Bring him on horseback through the city, and proclaim before him.</span> Compare the honours given to Joseph in Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>).

It was impossible for Haman to excuse himself; there was no ground on which he could decline the office thrust upon him. Reluctantly, without a word, he performed the king's bidding. HAMAN RETURNS HOME. DESPONDENCY OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS (<a href="../../par/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12-14</a>). There was as yet no real reason for Haman to feel depressed, or to regard himself as having lost favour with the king. He had been made an instrument in another man's honour, and had suffered a disappointment; but otherwise he was situated as on the day preceding, when he "went forth" from the palace "joyful and with a glad heart" (<a href="../../par/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9</a>). But he seems to have had a presentiment of impending calamity. All had as yet gone so well with him that the first vexation seemed like a turn in the tide, ominous of coming evil. And the fear of his own heart found an echo in the hearts of his wife and friends. Among the last were some who had the reputation of being "wise men" - perhaps Magians, acquainted with arts from which it was supposed they could divine the future. These persons ventured on a prediction. "If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely (or utterly) fall before him." With this evil presage ringing in his ears, Haman quitted his house, and accompanied the palace eunuchs who had been sent to conduct him to Esther's second banquet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Mordecai came again to the king's gate.

It is difficult to understand how this could any longer be regarded as doubtful.

At this crisis the king returned, and misconstruing Haman's action, or pretending to do so, exclaimed aloud, "Will he even force the queen with me in the house?" The terrible charge brought matters to a conclusion - it was taken as a call on the attendants to seize the culprit and execute him. <span class="cmt_word">They covered his face</span>, apparently, as that of a condemned man not worthy any more to see the light, according to a practice common among, the Romans (Liv., 1:26; Cic.

When a criminal was executed, everything that belonged to him became the property of the crown, and was disposed of according to the king's pleasure. It pleased Ahasuerus to make over to Esther the house of Haman, with, no doubt, all its content, attendants, furniture, and treasure. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews' enemy</span>. This now becomes Haman's ordinary designation (see <a href="../../par/esther/9-10.htm">Esther 9:10, 24</a>). Traditional practices have in many places kept up his memory as one of the most hated adversaries of the nation (see Stanley, 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, pp. 177, 178). <span class="cmt_word">And Mordecai came before the king</span>. Mordecai became a high official - one of those in constant attendance on the king<span class="cmt_word">. For Esther had told what he was to her</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> had revealed his relationship, had told that he was her cousin. Mordecai having been recognised as a "king's benefactor" (<a href="../../par/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3-11</a>), and Esther having been forced to confess herself a Jewess in order to save her nation (<a href="../../par/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3, 4</a>), there was no object in any further concealment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/8-2.htm">Esther 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king took off his ring</span>. The king's signet would, as a matter of course, be taken from Haman before his execution and restored to Ahasuerus, who now once more wore it himself. Business, however, was irksome to him, and, having resolved to make Mordecai minister in Haman's room, he very soon took the signet off again, and made it over to the new vizier. <span class="cmt_word">And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman</span>. It would not have been seemly for Esther to give away what she had received as a gift from the king. She was therefore unable to make Mordecai a present of the house. But she did what was equivalent - she set him over it, made him practically its master. Thus he was provided with a residence suitable to his new dignity. AT ESTHER'S REQUEST AHASUERUS ALLOWS THE ISSUE OF A SECOND EDICT, PERMITTING THE JEWS TO RESIST ANY WHO SHOULD ATTACK THEM, TO KILL THEM IN THEIR OWN DEFENCE, AND TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR GOODS (<a href="../../par/esther/8-3.htm">Esther 8:3-14</a>). The execution of Haman, the confiscation of his property, the advancement of Mordecai into his place, though of favourable omen, as showing the present temper and inclination of Abasuerus, left the Jews in as great danger as before. In most countries there would neither have been delay nor difficulty. The edict which went forth on the 13th of Nisan (<a href="../../par/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>), and which could not be executed till the 13th of Adar, would have been cancelled, revoked, recalled. But in Persia this could not be done; or at any rate it could not be done without breaking one of the first principles of Persian law, the principle that "the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse" (ver. 8). It was therefore necessary to devise a mode whereby the desired escape of the Jews might practically be obtained, and yet the edict remain unrevoked, and the king's honour be saved. At first Mordecai and Esther do not appear to have seen this, and Esther asked openly for the <span class="accented">reversal</span> of the decree, only representing it as the writing of Haman, and not the writing of the king (ver. 5). But Ahasuerus pointed out that this could not be done. Anything short of a reversal, any new decree, he would sanction; but he could do no more - he could not revoke his own word (ver. 8). The course actually followed was then devised, probably by Mordecai. The old decree was allowed to stand; but a new decree was issued and signed in the usual way, whereby the Jews were allowed and encouraged to resist those who should attack them, - to "gather themselves together, and to stand for their life; to destroy, slay, and cause to perish all the power of the people of the province that would assault them," - and were further permitted to "take the spoil of them for a prey," or, in other words, to seize the property of all whom they should slay (ver. 11). The royal posts carried out this decree (ver. 14), as they had the former one; and it was publicly set forth and proclaimed in every province, that if the Jews were attacked under the terms of the one, they might defend themselves and retaliate on their foes under the terms of the other (ver. 13). As the second decree was issued on the 23rd of Sivan, the third month (ver. 9), and the day appointed for the attack was the 13th of Adar, the twelfth, there was ample time-above eight months - for the Jews to make preparations, to organise themselves, to collect arms, and to arrange an effective resistance.

It might have seemed to be the business of Mordecai, as the king's chief minister, to advise him in a matter of public policy, and one in which the interests of so many of his subjects were vitally concerned. But the new minister did not perhaps feel sure of his influence, or quite know what to recommend. Esther was therefore again put forward to address the king. <span class="cmt_word">Fell down at his feet</span>.

MORDECAI'S HONOUR AND THE JEWS' JOY (<a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15-17</a>). Ahasuerus was not content even now with what he had done for Mordecai. Before his minister quitted the presence, the king presented him with a crown of gold, and a robe and vest of honour; and thus arrayed he proceeded into the city of Susa, where the new edict was already known, and had been received with satisfaction (ver. 15). The Persians, who formed the predominant element in the population of the town, sympathised with the Jews, and rejoiced in the king's favour towards them; while the Jews of Susa, having passed from despair to confident hope, were full of gladness and thankfulness. In the provinces the decree had a still warmer welcome. Its arrival was celebrated with "a feast" (ver. 17) and "a good day." It led also to many of the heathen becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion - some perhaps from conviction, but others because they thought it safer to place themselves manifestly on the Jews' side before the day of the struggle: 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Royal apparel of blue and white</span>. The Persian monarch himself wore a purple robe and an inner vest of purple striped with white ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 153, 154). The robes of honour which he gave away were of many different colours, but generally of a single tint throughout (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3, &sect; 3); but the one given to Mordecai seems to have been blue with white stripes. These were the colours of the royal diadem (Q. Curt., 'Vit. Alex.,' 3:3). <span class="cmt_word">A great crown of gold</span>. Not a tall crown, like that of the monarch, which is called in Hebrew <span class="accented">kether</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but '<span class="accented">atarah</span>, a crown of an inferior kind, frequently worn by nobles<span class="cmt_word">. And with a garment of fine linen and purple</span>. The "fine linen" was of course white. The real meaning of the word <span class="accented">thakrik</span>, translated "garment," is doubtful. Gesenius understands an outer garment' 'the long and flowing robe of an Oriental monarch;" in which case the "apparel" previously mentioned must be the inner vest. Others, as Patrick, make the <span class="accented">thakrik to</span> be the inner, and the "apparel" (<span class="accented">l'bush</span>) the outer garment. The Septuagint, however, translates <span class="accented">thakrik</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and its conjunction with the "crown" favours this rendering. The <span class="accented">diadem</span> proper of a Persian monarch was a band or fillet encircling the lower part of his crown, and was of blue, spotted or striped with white. Ahasuerus seems to have allowed Mordecai to wear a diadem of white and purple. <span class="cmt_word">The city of Shushan rejoiced</span>. As the Susanchites had been "perplexed" at the first edict (<a href="../../par/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), so were they "rejoiced" at the second.

It was customary in all wars for the number of the slain to be carefully made out and recorded. In the Babylonian transcript of the Behistun Inscription the numbers are given with extreme exactness - e.g. 546, 2024, 4203, etc. On this occasion it would seem that only a rough calculation was made. Still the king took care to be informed on the subject, and the Jews, aware of this, were not left absolutely uncontrolled.

It would seem that the Jews in Susa gathered themselves in the upper town on the appointed day, and were engaged there the whole day with their enemies. Esther asks that they may be allowed a second day - either in the upper or the lower town, it is not clear which to complete their work, and free themselves from all danger of further persecution from their foes. She is not likely to have made this request unless prompted to make it by Mordecai, who must have had means of knowing how matters really stood, and, as the chief minister over the whole nation, is likely to have been actuated rather by general views of policy than by a blind spirit of revenge. Still it must be granted that there is something essentially <span class="accented">Jewish</span> in Esther's request, and indeed in the tone of the entire book which bears her name

Exposure on a cross was regarded as a deep disgrace, and was a punishment often inflicted by the Persians on persons killed in some other way (see Herod., 3:125; 7:238; Xen., 'Anab.,' 3. 1, &sect; 17; Pint., 'Vit.

The idea of "rest" seems out of place when the subject of the narrative is slaughter, and the number of the slain has still to be told. Some suspect corruption, others an interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">And slew of their foes seventy and five thousand.</span> The LXX. had in their copies fifteen for seventy-five, or one-fifth of the received number. The smaller number is more in harmony with the 500 killed at Susa than the larger one. FESTIVAL HELD, AND FEAST OF PURIM INSTITUTED (<a href="../../par/esther/9-17.htm">Esther 9:17-32</a>). A natural instinct led the Jews, so soon as their triumph was accomplished, to indulge themselves in a day of rest and rejoicing (ver. 17). After toil there is need of repose; and escape from a great danger is followed, almost of necessity, by "gladness." The writer of the Book of Esther, practising his usual reticence, says nothing of the character of the "gladness;" but we can scarcely be wrong in believing it to have been, in the main, religious, and to have included gratitude to God for their deliverance, the ascription of praise to his name, and an outpouring of the heart before him in earnest and prolonged thanksgiving. The circumstances of the struggle caused a difference, with regard to the date of the day of rejoicing, between the Jews of the capital and those of the provinces. The metropolitical Jews had two days of struggle, and could not "rest" until the third day, which was the 15th of Adar (ver. 18); the provincial Jews began and ended their work in one day, the 13th, and so their thanksgiving-day was the 14th, and not the 15th of the month (ver. 17). The consequence was, that when Mordecai and Esther determined on commemorating the wonderful deliverance of their time by an annual festival, analogous to that of the passover, to be celebrated by all Jews everywhere throughout all future ages, some hesitation naturally arose as to the proper day to be kept holy. If the 14th were kept, the provincial Jews would be satisfied, but those of Susa would have cause of complaint; if the 15th were the day selected, the two parties would simply exchange feelings. Under these circumstances it was wisely resolved to keep both days (ver. 21). Nothing seems to have been determined as to the mode of keeping the feast, except that both days were to be "days of feasting and joy," and days upon which the richer members of the community should send "portions" and "gifts" to the poorer ones (ver. 22). The name, "feast of Purina," was at once attached to the festival, in memory of Haman's consultation of the lot, the word "Pur" meaning "lot" in Persian (ver. 24). The festival became a national institution by the general consent of the Jews everywhere (ver. 27), and has remained to the present day among the most cherished of their usages, it falls in early spring, a month before the passover, and occupies two days, which are still those fixed by Mordecai and Esther, the 14th and 15th of Adar. The day preceding the feast is observed as a fast day, in commemoration of Esther's fast before going in uninvited to the king (<a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-28.htm">Esther 9:28</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>that</i> these days <i>should be</i> remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and <i>that</i> these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family</span>, etc. The universal adoption of the Purina feast by the Jewish nation, originating as it did at Susa, among the Persian Jews, never a very important part of the nation, is a curious fact, and is certainly not satisfactorily accounted for by the beauty and popularity of the Book of Esther (Ewald), nor by the dignity and power of Mordecai. Mordecai had no ecclesiastical authority; and it might have been expected that the Jews of Jerusalem would have demurred to the imposition of a fresh religious obligation upon them by a Jew of the Dispersion, who was neither a prophet, nor a priest, nor even a Levite. The Jews of Jerusalem, in their strongly-situated city, which was wholly theirs, and with their temple-fortress complete (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>), can scarcely have felt themselves in much danger from an attack which was to have begun and ended in a day. But Joiakim, the high priest of the time (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10-12</a>), to whom, as we have seen ('Introduction,' &sect; 3), the Book of Esther was attributed by some, must have given his approval to the feast from the first, and have adopted it into the ceremonial of the nation, or it would scarcely have become universal. Hooker ('Eccl. Pol.,' 5:71, &sect; 6) rightly makes the establishment of the feast an argument in favour of the Church's power to prescribe festival days; and it must certainly have been by ecclesiastical, and not by civil, command that it became obligatory. <span class="cmt_word">That these days... should not fail,...  nor the memorial of them perish</span>. As a commemoration of human, and not of Divine, appointment, the feast of Purim was liable to abrogation or discontinuance. The Jews of the time resolved that the observance should be perpetual; and in point of fact the feast has continued up to the present date, and is likely to continue, though they could not bind their successors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-29.htm">Esther 9:29</a></div><div class="verse">Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail,...  wrote</span>. The unusual designation of Esther as "daughter of Abihail" can only be accounted for by her having so designated herself in the letter. <span class="cmt_word">With all authority</span>. Rather, "with all earnestness," or "impressiveness." Literally, the word used means "strength." <span class="cmt_word">To confirm this second letter of Purina</span>. The <span class="accented">first</span> letter is the one which is mentioned in vers. 20 and 26. That letter having elicited the favourable reply contained in vers. 26-28, a "second letter of Purina" was now issued, "confirming" and establishing the observance. It went forth not as an edict, or in the king's name, but as a letter, and in the names of Esther and Mordecai. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-30.htm">Esther 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>with</i> words of peace and truth,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sent the letters</span>. Rather, "he sent letters." In addition to the formal "letter of Purina," which was of the nature of an ordinance, though not of legal force, Mordecai sent informal letters, which embraced other topics besides the Purim feast, as, for instance, words of salutation, and perhaps a reference to the keeping of a fast before the two Purina days (ver. 31). These he sent to all Jews throughout the whole empire, inclosing with them the formal "letter of Purim." <span class="cmt_word">With words of peace and truth</span>. Perhaps beginning thus: "Peace and truth be with you" - a modification of the usual, "Peace," etc. (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>), or, "All peace" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 5:7), with which letters ordinarily began. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-31.htm">Esther 9:31</a></div><div class="verse">To confirm these days of Purim in their times <i>appointed</i>, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they had decreed for themselves and their seed</span>. "As they - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews generally - had decreed" (see ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">The matters of the fastings and their cry</span>. These words stand in no clear grammatical relation to the preceding, and are otherwise very difficult to explain. They are thought to allude to the establishment by the provincial Jews, apart from Mordecai and Esther, of the 13th of Adar as a day of fasting and wailing; but if so, it is strange that nothing has been previously said of this ordinance. The plural form of the word for "fastings" is also suspicious, since it does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. Altogether, it is perhaps most probable that the words were originally the gloss of a commentator, written in the margin, and that they have been accidentally transferred to the text. They do not occur in the Septuagint. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-32.htm">Esther 9:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The decree of Esther</span>. Rather, "a commandment of Esther." Some fresh act seems to be intended - something beyond the joint letter of Esther and Mordecai; though why it was needed, or what additional authority it could give, is not apparent. <span class="cmt_word">And it was written in the book</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "this commandment of Esther was inserted in the book of the chronicles," where the writer probably found it. No other book being mentioned in Esther but this, "the book" can have no other meaning (see <a href="../../par/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../esther/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Esther 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Esther 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../esther/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Esther 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Esther 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
