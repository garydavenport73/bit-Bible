It does not necessarily, follow that the command was actually given exactly at this time, or that all the different directions for use formed part of one communication. They may have been gathered together for convenience sake. See the Introduction on this subject. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that this use of trumpets has been anticipated in <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>, or elsewhere, for the "trumpets" there mentioned were altogether different in shape, as in material. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thee two trumpets.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">khatsotserah.</span> From the testimony of Josephus, from the representation on the arch of Titus, and from a comparison of ancient Egyptian trumpets, it is clear that these trumpets were straight, long, and narrow, with an expanded mouth.

This seems to signify a continuous peal, easily distinguished, wherever audible, from the blowing in short, sharp tones (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) mentioned below, verse 7. The peal of alarm was to be blown - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> - "for their breaking up" - for that purpose,  and no other. The camps. Only those on the east (Judah, with Issachar and Zebulun) and on the south (Reuben, with Simeon and Gad) are here mentioned. It may be that the silver trumpets themselves were carried with the sacred utensils after the southern camps, and that some other means were employed to start the remaining tribes; or it may be that the omission is due to some accidental circumstance. The Septuagint inserts in verse 6, "And ye shall sound a third alarm, and the camps which are pitched westwards shall move; and ye shall sound a fourth alarm, and the camps which are pitched northwards shall move." No doubt this was the actual order of starting, however the signal was given. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-6.htm">Numbers 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</div><div class="comm">

The truth of these words cannot be exhausted by an actual use of 1500 years, followed by complete disuse for 1800 years. The "ordinance" of the silver trumpets must be perpetuated "forever" in the gospel, or else the Divine word has failed.

In your land. The practical use of the trumpets ceased with the years of wandering; the ceremonial use was continued as long as the people dwelt in "their land;" the spiritual use remains an "ordinance for ever," as long as the Church is militant here on earth. That the use of the two silver trumpets was ceremonial, and not practical, after the conquest of Canaan is evident from the purpose and effect ascribed to that use. Whether in war or in worship, that purpose was <span class="accented">not</span> to convoke the people, nor to give signals to the host, <span class="accented">but</span> to put God in mind of his promises, and to invoke his covenanted grace. Indeed, two trumpets, as here prescribed, could not be otherwise than ceremonially used after the nation was spread abroad over the whole face of Canaan; and there is no direction to make more than two such trumpets. The use of trumpets in subsequent times is indeed often mentioned both in war and in holy festivities, and it was undoubtedly founded upon this Divine ordinance; but it was not in literal compliance with it, for the obvious reason that many trumpets were used instead of two only (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>). In these passages (and probably in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>) we have abundant evidence of one of those expansions and adaptations of the Mosaic ritual which were so freely made under the house of David. Chapter 31:6, and (perhaps) <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>, and <a href="../../par/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a> may be quoted as pointing to the strict fulfillment of the law as it stands.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - On <span class="cmt_word">the twentieth day</span> of <span class="cmt_word">the second month.</span> This answered approximately to our May 6th, when the spring verdure would still be on the land, but the heat of the day would already have become intense. We may well suppose that the departure would have taken place a month earlier, had it not been necessary to wait for the due celebration of the second or supplemental passover (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-11.htm">Numbers 9:11</a>). As this march was, next to the actual exodus, <span class="accented">the</span> great trial of Israel's faith and obedience, it was most important that none should commence it otherwise than in full communion with their God and with one another. <span class="cmt_word">The cloud was taken up.</span> For the first time since the tabernacle had been reared up (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Took their journeys.</span> Literally, "marched according to their journeys" <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>.

It appears, however, from <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a> that "the wilderness of Paran" was fully reached after leaving Hazeroth at the end of three days' journey from Sinai, nor would a shorter space of time suffice to carry the host across the mountain barrier of the Jebel et-Tih, which forms the clearly-marked southern limit of the desert plateau of Paran (see next note). Some critics have arbitrarily extended the limits of "the wilderness of Paran" so as to include the sandy waste between Sinai and the Jebel et-Tih, and therefore the very first halting-place of Israel. This, however, is unnecessary as well as arbitrary; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> verses 12, 13 are evidently in the nature of a summary, and the same subject is confessedly taken up again in verse 33, <span class="accented">sq.</span>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the departure from Sinai is expressly said to have been for a "three days' journey" (verse 33), which must mean that the march, although actually divided into three stages, was regarded as a single journey, because it brought  them to their immediate destination in the wilderness of Paran. Here then is a plain reason for the statement in this verse: the cloud <span class="accented">did</span> indeed rest twice between the two wildernesses, but only so as to allow of a night's repose, not so as to break the continuity of the march. "The <span class="accented">wilderness of Paran."</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. This geographical expression is nowhere exactly defined in Holy Scripture, and the name itself has disappeared; for in spite of the resemblance in sound (a resemblance here, as in so many cases, wholly delusive), it seems to have no connection whatever with the Wady Feiran, the fertile valley at the base of Serbal, or with the town which once shared the name. All the allusions, however, in the Old Testament to Paran point to a district so clearly marked out, so deeply stamped with its own characteristics, by nature, that no mistake is possible. This district is now called et-Tih, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the wandering, and is still remembered in the traditions of the Arabs as the scene of the wanderings of the people of God. Little known, and never thoroughly explored, its main features are nevertheless unmistakable, and its boundaries sharply defined. Measuring about 150 miles in either direction, its southern frontier (now called the Jebel et-Tih) is divided by the broad sandy waste of er-Ramleh from the Sinaitic mountains and the Sinaitic peninsula properly so called; its northern mountain mass looks across the deep fissure of the Wady Murreh (or desert of Zin), some ten or fifteen miles broad, into er-Rachmah, the mountain of the Amorite, the southern extension of the plateau of Judah; on the east it fails abruptly down to the narrow beach of the Elanite Gulf, and to the Arabah; on the west alone it sinks slowly into the sandy desert of Shur, which separates it from the Mediterranean and from Egypt. Et-Tih is itself divided into nearly equal halves, by the Wady el Arish (or "river of Egypt"), which, rising on the northern slopes of the Jebel et-Tih, and running northwards through the whole plateau, turns off to the west and is lost in the desert of Shur. That the western half of the plateau went also under the name of Paran is evident from the history of Ishmael (see especially <a href="../../par/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>), but it was through the eastern portion alone that the wanderings of the Israelites, so far as we can trace them, lay. This "wilderness of Paran" is indeed "a great and terrible wilderness" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>), lacking for the most part the precipitous grandeur of the granite mountains of Sinai, but lacking also their fertile valleys and numerous streams. A bare limestone or sandstone plateau, crossed by low ranges of hills, seamed with innumerable dry water-courses, and interspersed with large patches of sand and gravel, is what <span class="cmt_word">now</span> meets the eye of the traveler in this forsaken land. It is true that a good deal of rain falls at times, and that when it does fall vegetation appears with surprising rapidity and abundance; it is true also that the district has been persistently denuded of trees and shrubs for the sake of fuel. But whatever mitigations may have then existed, it is clear from the Bible itself that the country was then, as now, emphatically frightful (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). Something may be set, no doubt, to the account of rhetoric, and much may be allowed for variety of seasons. Even in Australia the very same district will appear at one time like the desolation of a thousand years, and in the very next year it will blossom as the rose. But at certain seasons at any rate et-Tih was (as it is) a "howling" wilderness, where the dreadful silence of a lifeless land was only broken by the nightly howling of unclean beasts who tracked the footsteps of the living in order to devour the carcasses of the dead. Perhaps so bad a country has never been attempted by any army in modern days, even by the Russian troops in Central Asia. Amongst the many Wadys which drain the uncertain rain-fall of the eastern half of et-Tih (and at the same time testify to a greater rain-fall in bygone ages), the most important is the Wady el Terafeh, which, also rising on the northern slopes of Jebel et-Tih, runs northwards and north-westwards, and finally opens into the Arabah. Towards its northern limit et-Tih changes its character for the worse. Here it rises into a precipitous quadrilateral of mountains, about forty miles square, not very lofty, but exceedingly steep and rugged, composed in great measure of dazzling masses of bare chalk or limestone, which glow as in a furnace beneath the summer sun. This mountain mass, now called the Azaimat, or mountain country of the Azazimeh, rising steeply from the rest of the plateau to the southward, is almost completely detached by deep depressions from the surrounding districts; at the north-west corner alone it is united by a short range of mountains with er-Rachmah, and so with the highlands of Southern Palestine. From this corner the Wady Murreh descends broad and deep towards the cast, forking at the eastern extremity towards the Arabah on the southeast, and towards the Dead Sea on the north. east. The interior of this inaccessible country has yet to be really explored, and it is the scanty nature of our present knowledge concerning it which, more than anything else, prevents us from following with any certainty the march of the Israelites as recorded in this book.

At that time the duties of the several Levitical families had not been specified, and the orders for the taking down and transport of the tabernacle and its furniture had not been given in detail. It would be historically an error, and theologically a superstition, to imagine that Divine commands such as these had no elasticity, and left no room for adaptation, under the teaching of experience, or for the sake of obvious convenience. Whether the present modification was directly commanded by God himself, or whether it was made on the authority of Moses, does not here appear. There can be no question that subsequent theocratic rulers of Israel claimed and used a large liberty in modifying the Divinely-originated ritual and order.

The question may here be asked, which is considered more at large in the Introduction, how it was possible for a nation of more than two million souls, containing the usual proportion of aged people, women, and children, to march as here represented, in compact columns closely following one another, without straggling, without confusion, without incalculable suffering and loss of life. That the line of march was intended to be compact and unbroken is plain (amongst other things) from the directions given about the tabernacle. The fabric was sent on in advance with the evident intent that it should be reared up and ready to receive the holy things by the time they arrived. Yet between the fabric and the furniture there marched more than half a million of people (the camp of Reuben), all of whom had to reach the camping ground and turn off to the right before the Kohathites could rejoin their brethren. Now discipline and drill will do wonders in the way of ordering and expediting the movements even of vast multitudes, if they are thoroughly under control; the family organization also of the tribes, and the long leisure which they had enjoyed at Sinai, gave every opportunity of perfecting the necessary discipline. But it is clear that no discipline could make such an arrangement as the one above mentioned feasible under the ordinary circumstances of human life. It would be absolutely necessary to eliminate all the casualties and all the sicknesses which would naturally clog and hinder the march of such a multitude, in order that it might be compressed within the required limits of time and space. Have we any ground for supposing that these casualties and sicknesses <span class="accented">were</span> eliminated? In answering this question we must clearly distinguish between the journey from Sinai to Kadesh, on the borders of Palestine, <span class="accented">which was a journey of only eleven days</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>), and the subsequent wanderings of the people of Israel. It is the eleven days' journey only with which we are concerned, because it was for this journey only that provision was made and orders were given by the God of Israel. During the subsequent years of wandering and of excommunication, there can be no doubt that the marching orders fell into abeyance as entirely as the sacrificial system and the rite of circumcision itself. During these years the various camps may have scattered themselves abroad, marched,  and halted very much as the circumstances of the day demanded. But that this was not and could not be the case during the short journey which <span class="accented">should</span> have landed them in Canaan is obvious from the whole tone, as well as from the particular details, of the commandments considered above. It is further to be borne in mind that the Divine promise and undertaking at the exodus was, impliedly if not explicitly, to bring the whole people, one and all, small and great, safely to their promised home. When the Psalmist asserts (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a>) that "there was not one feeble person among their tribes," he does not go beyond what is plainly intimated in the narrative. If of their cattle "not an hoof" must be left behind, lest the absolute character of the deliverance be marred, how much more necessary was it that not a soul be abandoned to Egyptian vengeance? And how could all depart unless all were providentially saved from sickness and infirmity? But the same necessity (the necessity of his own goodness) held good when the exodus was accomplished. God could not bring any individual in Israel out of Egypt only to perish in the wilderness, unless it were through his own default, he who had brought them <span class="accented">out</span> with so lavish a display of miraculous power was (we may say with <span class="accented">reverence</span>) bound also to bring them <span class="accented">in</span>; else they had been actual losers by obedience, and his word had not been kept to them. Under a covenant and a dispensation which assuredly did not look one hand's breadth beyond the present life, it must have seemed to be of the essence of the promise which they believed that not one of them should die or have to be left behind. And as the death or loss of one of God's people would have vitiated the temporal promise to <span class="accented">thegn</span>, so also it would have vitiated the eternal promise to <span class="accented">us.</span> For they were ensamples of us, and confessedly what was done for them was done at least as much for our sakes as for theirs. Now the promise of God is manifest unto every one that is included within his new covenant, viz., to bring him safely at last unto the heavenly Canaan, and that in spite of every danger, if only he do not draw back. The whole analogy, therefore, and the typical meaning of the exodus would be overthrown if any single Israelite who had crossed the Red Sea failed to enter into rest, save as the consequence of his own sin. We conclude, therefore, with some confidence that the ordinary incidents of mortality were providentially excluded from the present march, as from the previous interval; that none fell sick, none became helpless, none died a natural death. We know that the great difficulty of a sufficient supply of food was miraculously met; we know that in numberless respects the passage from Egypt to Canaan was hedged about with supernatural aids. Is there any difficulty in supposing that he who gave them bread to eat and water to drink, who led them by a cloudy and a fiery pillar, could also give them health and strength to "walk and not be weary"? Is it unreasonable to imagine that he who spake in his tender pity of the flight from Judaea to Pella, "Woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days," miraculously restrained for that season the natural increase of his people? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:29-32 THE INVITATION TO HOBAB (verses 29-32). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hobab, the sou of Raguel</span> (or rather Reuel, of which Raguel is simply the Septuagint and Vulgate variation), Moses' father-in-law. It is not quite certain who this "Hobab" was. The name occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>. The older opinion, followed by the A.V., identified Hobab with Jethro, and Jethro with Reuel the "priest of Midian," and father of Zipporah, Moses' wife. It is, of course, no real objection to this opinion that Hobab is here called the "son of Reuel;" for the name may quite well have been an hereditary one, like Abimelech and so many others. Nor need the multiplicity of names given to one individual astonish us, for it is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament, and not infrequent in the New. The father-in-law of Moses was a priest, holding (probably by right of birth) the patriarchal dignity of tribal priest, as Job did on a smaller, and Melchizedec on a larger, scale. He may very well, therefore, have had one or more "official" names in addition to his personal name. If this is accepted, then it may serve as one instance amongst many to remind us how extremely careless the inspired writers are about names - "careless" not in the sense of not caring whether they are right or wrong, but in the sense of not betraying and not feeling the least anxiety to avoid the appearance and suspicion of inaccuracy. Even in the lists of the twelve apostles we arc forced to believe that "Judas the brother of James" is the same person as "Lebbaeus" and "Thaddaeus;" and it is a matter of endless discussion whether or no "Bartholomew" was the same as "Nathanael." On the face of it Scripture proclaims that it uses no arts, that it takes no pains to preserve an appearance of accuracy - that appearance which is so easily simulated for the purposes of falsehood. Holy Scripture may therefore fairly claim to be read without that captiousness, without that demand for minute carefulness and obvious consistency, which we rightly apply to one of our own histories. The modern historian avowedly tells his story as a witness does in the presence of a hostile counsel; the sacred historian tells his as a man does to the children round his knee. Surely such an obvious fact should disarm a good deal of the petty criticism which carps at the sacred narrative. Many, however, will think that the balance of probability is against the older opinion. It is certain that the word translated "father-in-law" has no such definiteness either in the Hebrew or in the Septuagint. It means simply a "marriage relation," and is even used by Zipporah of Moses himself (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25, 26</a> - Hebrew. The Septuagint avoids the word). It is just as likely to mean "brother-in-law" when applied to Hobab. As Moses was already eighty years old when Jethro is first mentioned (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), it may seem probable that his father-in-law was by that time dead, and succeeded in his priestly office by his eldest son. In that case Hobab would be a younger son of Reuel, and as such free to leave the home of his ancestors and to join himself to his sister's people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-30.htm">Numbers 10:30</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-31.htm">Numbers 10:31</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.</span> It is an obvious conclusion, from the reasons here urged by Moses, that the many and wonderful promises of Divine guidance and Divine direction did <span class="accented">not</span> supersede in his eyes the use of all available human aids. It is not indeed easy to say <span class="accented">where</span> any room was left for the good <span class="accented">offices</span> and experience of Hobab; the cloud of the Divine Presence <span class="accented">seemed</span> to control absolutely the journeying and encamping of the people; yet if we really knew in detail the actual ordering of that wondrous march, we should doubtless find that the heavenly guidance did but give unity and certainty to all the wisdom, caution, and endeavour of its earthly leaders. Indeed if we recall to mind that the host is calculated at more than two millions of people, it is quite evident that even during the march to Kadesh (and much more in the long wanderings which followed) it must have been extremely difficult to keep the various divisions together. In the broken and difficult country which they were to traverse, which had been familiar to Hobab from his youth, there would be scope enough for all his ability as a guide. And it would seem that it was just this prospect of being really useful to the people of Israel that prevailed with Hobab. He must indeed have felt assured that a wonderful future awaited a nation whose past and present were, even within his own knowledge, so wonderful. But that alone could not move him to leave his own land and his own kindred, a firing so unspeakably repugnant to the feelings and traditions of his age and country. Doubtless to the child of the desert, whose life was a never-ending struggle with the dangers and vicissitudes of the wilderness, the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, watered with the rain of heaven, seemed like the garden of Eden. Yet the offer of an heritage within that land moved him  not so much, it would appear, as the claim upon his own good offices in helping the chosen people to reach their own abode. The Septuagint translation, or rather paraphrase, of this verse is, "Leave us not, forasmuch as thou wast with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us." This seems, on the one hand, to identify Hobab with Jethro; on the other, to imply that he was shortly afterwards one of the seventy elders upon whom the spirit came. This, however, is not likely. Hobab does indeed seem to have gone with the people, but his descendants were not incorporated into Israel; they were with them, but not of them.

Here is an "undesigned coincidence," albeit a slight one. Judah led the way on the march from Sinai to Canaan, and Hobab's duties as guide and scout would bring him more into contact with that tribe than with any other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:33-36 THE ACTUAL DEPARTURE FROM SINAI (verses 33-36). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a></div><div class="verse">And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they departed.</span> These words mark the moment of actual departure, which has been anticipated in the general statement of verse 12. It was one of the supreme moments in the life of Israel - one of those beginnings or "departures" which lead to untold gain or loss; it was, in fact, although they knew it not, the commencement of a march which for almost all of them should know no end except within a hasty grave. No doubt, during the months spent at Sinai, <span class="accented">every</span> preparation had been made for the onward journey; but none the less it was a stupendous enterprise to march that vast host, so largely composed of women and children, so little inured to such fatigue, and so impatient of such discipline, for three consecutive days into a wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Three days' journey.</span> This expression is apparently a general <span class="accented">one</span>, and not to be strictly pressed (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). At the same time it implies <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the host twice halted for the night during the journey, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the whole journey was regarded as one and in some sense as complete in itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of this three days' journey is given us in verse 12; it was to take them across the intervening belt of sand, and to land them fairly within the "wilderness of Paran." During this journey no doubt the march would be pushed on as steadily as possible, but it is not likely that it would cover so much as thirty miles. A modern army, unencumbered with non-combatants, does not make more than ten miles a day over difficult country, nor can cattle be driven faster than that. Even to accomplish that rate, and to <span class="accented">keep</span> the whole multitude together, as the narrative implies, required supernatural aid and strength. For the direction of the march see notes on chapter 13. <span class="cmt_word">The ark</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the covenant of the Lord went before them.</span> It is obvious that what is apparently affirmed here is apparently at variance with <a href="../../par/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a> and verse 21 of this chapter, which speak of the holy things - of which the ark was the most holy - as carried by the Kohathites in the very midst of the long line of march. Three opinions have been held on the subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the ark was really carried with the other "holy things," and only "went before" metaphorically, as a general may be said to lead his troops, although he may not be actually in front of them; to which it is obvious <span class="cmt_word">to</span> reply that if the ark did not actually precede the host, there was no possible way in which it could direct their movements; the cloud alone would be the visible expression of the Divine guidance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the "holy things" generally were ordered to be carried in the midst of the host by the Kohathites, but that God reserved the place of the ark itself to his own immediate disposition. A general does not include himself in his own marching orders, however minute; and the ark was the outward symbol of God's own personal presence and guidance. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that the first intimation of the position of the ark on the march should be given at the moment when the march actually commenced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the usual place for the ark was no doubt with the sanctuary, as implied in the orders, but that o a <span class="accented">this special occasion</span> the ark went to the front in consequence of some Divine intimation, just as it did at the crossing of Jordan and at the taking of Jericho. Certainly there is much reason in this view, considering how momentous and formidable was their first assay at marching from their temporary home towards that unknown land beyond the northern horizon. If the deep waters of Jordan might fright them, or the walls of Jericho defy them, well might they shrink from plunging into the broken, stony, and intractable country into which the ark and the cloud now led them. We shall probably think that either habitually or at least occasionally the ark <span class="accented">did</span> go before, and that the feet of them that bare it were supernaturally directed, either by the movements of the cloud, or by some more secret intimation, towards the destined place of rest. It is allowed by all that the cloud preceded and directed the march, and it would be strange indeed if these twin symbols of the Divine presence had been so far separated from one another; for the accustomed place of the cloud was above the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, above the ark, yet outside of the tabernacle, so as to be visible to all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a></div><div class="verse">And the cloud of the LORD <i>was</i> upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">cloud of the Lord was upon them by day.</span> It would seem as if the cloud, which was luminous by night, dense and dark by day, spread itself upwards and backwards from over the ark, overshadowing the host as it followed - a refreshment at any rate to those who were near, perhaps to all, and a guiding beacon to those who were afar. To what extent the people at large were able to enjoy this shade amidst the burning heats of the desert we cannot possibly tell, but there is no doubt that it dwelt in the memory of the nation, and gave meaning to such expressions as the "shadow of the Almighty" (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>), and "the shadow of a cloud" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the ark set forward.</span> These words, taken in connection with the words "when it rested," in the following verse, confirm the belief that at this time  (at any rate) the ark went before the host; for if it had remained in the midst, it would not have stirred until half the tribes had moved off, nor would it have halted until half the camp was pitched, whereas it is evident that its setting forward and standing still were the decisive moments of the day. They had, as it were, a sacramental character; they were visible signs, corresponding to invisible realities, as the movements of the hands on the dial correspond to the action of the machinery within. When the ark and the cloud set forward, it was the Almighty God going on before to victory; when the ark and the cloud rested, it was the all-merciful God returning to protect and cherish his own. This is clearly recognized in the morning and evening prayer of Moses. The typical and spiritual character of that setting forward and that resting could not well have been lost upon any religious mind - that God going before us is the certain and abiding pledge of final victory, that God returning to us is the only hope of present safety. <span class="cmt_word">Rise up, Lord, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">let thine enemies be scattered.</span> The sixty-eighth Psalm, which we have learnt to associate with the wonders of Pentecost and the triumphs of the Church on earth, seems to be an expansion of Moses' morning prayer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a></div><div class="verse">And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Return, O</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord, unto the many thousands</span> (literally, myriad thousands; see <a href="../../par/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>) of Israel. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> being construed with the accusative is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. It may be as in the beautiful and familiar rendering of the A.V., than which nothing could be more obviously in harmony with the circumstances, and the feelings which gave rise to the prayer. Or it may be necessary to translate it by a transitive verb, and then it will be either, with many moderns, "Restore, O Lord, the myriad thousands of Israel," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to their promised home; or, with the Septuagint, "Convert, O Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>), the thousand myriads of Israel." If the ordinary reading be (as it appears) grammatically defensible, it is unquestionably to be preferred.

The Septuagint transposes verse 34 from its proper place to the end of the chapter, apparently in order to keep together the verses which speak of the movements of the ark.

It is literally, "And the people were as complainers evil in the ears of the Lord." This may be paraphrased as in the A.V.; or it may be rendered as in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>), where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> means the wicked things they uttered in their discontent; or the "evil" may mean the hardships they complained cf. The Targums understand it in the same way as the Septuagint, and this seems to agree best with the context. As to the time and place of this complaining, the narrative seems to limit it within the three days' march from the wilderness of Sinai; but it is not possible to fix it more precisely. It is sufficient that the very first incident in the great journey thought worthy of record was this sin and its punishment, and the natural conclusion is that it came to pass very shortly after the departure. As to the reason of the complaining, although it is not stated, and although there does not seem to have been any special cause of distress, we can hardly be mistaken about it. The fatigue and anxiety of the march, after a year's comparative idleness, the frightful nature of the country into which they were marching, and the unknown terrors of the way which lay before them, these were quite enough to shake their nerves and upset their minds. Such things could only be borne and faced in a spirit of faith and trustful dependence upon God and their appointed leaders, and that spirit they knew nothing cf. Slavery, even when its outward pressure is past and gone like a bad dream, leaves behind it above all things an incurable suspicion of, and a rooted disbelief in, others, which shows itself outwardly by blank ingratitude and persistent complaint of bad treatment. This is the well-known mental attitude of liberated slaves even towards their benefactors and liberators; and in the case of Israel this temper extended to the King of Israel himself, whom they held responsible for all the privations and terrors of an apparently needless journey through a hideous waste. The Targum of Palestine says here, "There were wicked men of the people who, being discontent, devised and imagined evil before the Lord." The complaining, however, seems to have been general throughout the host, as the Psalmist more truly acknowledges (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the fire of the Lord burnt among them.</span> The "fire of the Lord" may mean one of three things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Lightning, as apparently in <a href="../../par/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>; for lightning to the unscientific is the fiery bolt, even as thunder is the angry voice, of God (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18, 19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A miraculous outburst of flame from the Presence in the tabernacle, such as slew Nadab and Abihu (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>), and afterwards the 250 men who offered incense (chapter 16:35). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A miraculous descent of fire from heaven, as apparently in <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>). Of these the second seems to be excluded by the fact that the conflagration was in the outskirts of the camp furthest removed from the tabernacle. If we suppose the fire to have been natural, we may further suppose that it set alight to the dry bushes and shrubs which abound in parts of the desert, and which blaze with great fury when the flame is driven by the wind. It is, however, at least as likely that a wholly supernatural visitation of God is  here intended. What is most important to notice is this, that the punishment in this case followed hard and sore upon the sin, whereas before they came to Sinai the Lord had passed over similar murmurings without any chastisement (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>). The reason of this difference was twofold. In the first place, they had now had abundant opportunity to become acquainted with the power and goodness of the Lord, and had solemnly entered into covenant with him, and he had taken up his abode among them; wherefore their responsibilities grew with their privileges, their dangers kept pace with their advantages. In the second place, they had while at Sinai committed an act of national apostasy (<a href="../../par/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>), the punishment of which, although suspended (verse 14), was only suspended (verse 34), and was always capable of being revived; Israel was plainly warned that he was under sentence, and that any disobedience would awake the terrors of the Lord against him. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">consumed...  in the uttermost parts of the camp.</span> Probably setting fire to the outer line of tents, or some pitched outside the line, and consuming the people that were in them. The Targum of Palestine affirms that it "destroyed some of the wicked in the outskirts of the house of Dan, with whom was a graven image;" but this attempt to shift the responsibility, and to alter the character of the sin, is clearly worthless, and only suggested by occurrences wholly unconnected with the present (see <a href="../../par/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-2.htm">Numbers 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people cried unto Moses.</span> Fear brought them to their senses, and they knew that their only hope was in their mediator, who had already saved them by his intercession from a worse destruction (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The fire was quenched.</span> Rather, "went out."

This name does not occur in the list of stations in chapter 33, which mentions nothing between Sinai and Kibroth-Hattaavah. It would seem probable, however, that the conflagration occurred while Israel was encamped, or else there could hardly have been a burning "in the end of the camp." We may therefore suppose either that Tabeerah was some spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Sinai whither the people gathered for their first long march; or that it was one of the halting-places on the "three days' journey" not mentioned in the list, because that journey was considered as all one; or that it was the same place afterwards called Kibroth-Hatta-avah. There is nothing in the narrative to decide a question which is in itself unimportant. It is necessary to remember that where the ancient and local names derived from marked natural features were not available, such names as Tabeerah given to the halting-places of so vast a host must have had a very loose significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 11:4-35 KIBROTH HATTAAVAH (verses 4-35). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the mixt multitude that <i>was</i> among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The mixed multitude.</span> Hebrew, ha-<span class="accented">saphsuph</span>, the gathered; the rift-raft, or rabble, which had followed the fortunes of Israel out of Egypt, where they had probably been strangers and slaves themselves. What the nature and the number and the fate of this rabble were is a matter of mere conjecture  and of some perplexity. There does not seem any room for them in the regulations laid down for Israel, nor are they mentioned in any other place except at <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-10.htm">Leviticus 24:10</a> we read of the son of an Israelitish woman by an Egyptian father, and this might lead us to conjecture that a great part of the "mixed multitude" was the offspring of such left-handed alliances. These half-breeds, according to the general rule in such cases, would follow their mothers; they would be regarded with contempt by the Jews of pure blood, and would accompany the march as hangers-on of the various tribes with which they were connected. As to their fate, it may be probably concluded, from the reason of things and from the absence of any further notice of them, that they found their way back to the slavery and the indulgences of Egypt; they were bound by no such strong restraints and animated by no such national feelings as the true people of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel also wept again.</span> This expression, again (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, used adverbially), would seem to point to some former weeping, and this is generally found in the "murmuring" of which they had been guilty in the desert of Sin (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2, 3</a>). This, however, is unsatisfactory for several reasons: first, because that occurrence was too remote, having been more than a year ago; second, because there is no mention of any "weeping" at that time; third, because the matter of complaint on the two occasions was really quite different: <span class="accented">then</span> they murmured faithlessly at the blank starvation which apparently stared them in the face; <span class="accented">now</span> they weep greedily at the absence of remembered luxuries. It is therefore much more likely that the expression has regard to the "complaining" which had just taken place at Tabeerah. It was indeed wonderful that the punishment then inflicted did not check the sin; wonderful that it burst out again in an aggravated form almost immediately. But such was the obstinacy of this people, that Divine vengeance, which only perhaps affected a few, and only lasted for a brief space, was not sufficient to silence their wicked clamour. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> - Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> - means flesh-meat generally. They had flocks and herds it is true, but they were no doubt carefully preserved, and the increase of them would little more than suffice for sacrifice; no one would dream of slaughtering them for ordinary eating. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.,<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> gratis. No doubt this was an exaggeration on the part of the murmurers, but it is attested by classical writers that fish swarmed in the Nile waters, and cost next to nothing (Died. Sic., 1:36, 52; Herod., 2:93; Strabo, 17. page 829). <span class="cmt_word">Cucumbers.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

Water-melons, still called <span class="accented">battieh</span>, grow in Egypt, as in all hot, moist lands, like weeds, and are as much the luxury of the poorest as of the richest. <span class="cmt_word">Leeks.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. This word usually means grass (as in <a href="../../par/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), and may do so hare, for the modern Egyptians eat a kind of field-clover freely. The Septuagint, however, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, leeks or chives, which agrees better with the context. Pliny (Nat.

These are mentioned in the well-known passage of Herodotus (2:125) as forming the staple food of the workmen at the pyramids; these still form a large part of the diet of the labouring classes in Egypt, as in other Mediterranean countries. If we look at these different articles of food together, so naturally and inartificially mentioned in this verse, we find a strong argument for the genuineness of the narrative. They are exactly the luxuries which an Egyptian labourer of that day would have cried out for, if deprived of them; they are <span class="accented">not</span> the luxuries which a Jew of Palestine would covet, or would even think cf. The very words here used for the cucumber, the melon, and the garlic were probably Egyptian, for they may still be recognized in the common names of those vegetables in Egypt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">But now our soul <i>is</i> dried away: <i>there is</i> nothing at all, beside this manna, <i>before</i> our eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our soul is</span> <span class="cmt_word">dried away.</span> This exaggerated statement expressed their craving for the juicy and savoury food of which they had been thinking, and which was obviously unattainable in the wilderness. There is a physical craving in man for variety of diet, and especially for such condiments and flavours as he has been used to all his life, which makes the lack of them a real hardship. It is not necessary to condemn the Israelites for feeling very keenly the loss of their accustomed food, which is notoriously the one thing which the poorest classes <span class="cmt_word">are</span> least able to bear; it is only necessary to condemn them for making this one loss of more account than all their gain. <span class="cmt_word">There is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</span> Rather, "we have nothing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>) except that our eye (falls) upon this manna." These graphic words speak of the longing looks which turned in every direction after the accustomed dainties, only to fall with disgust upon the inevitable manna. It was very ungrateful of them to speak disparagingly of the manna, which was good and wholesome food, and sufficient to keep them in health and strength; but it is useless to  deny that manna only for people who had been accustomed to a rich and varied diet must have been exceedingly trying both to the palate and the stomach (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the manna <i>was</i> as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The manna was as coriander seed.</span> On the name and the nature of the manna see <a href="../../par/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>. It is commonly supposed that the brief description here inserted was intended to show the unreasonableness of the popular complaints. There is no trace whatever of any such purpose. So far as the description conveys fresh information, it was simply suggested by the occurrence of the word "manna," according to the artless style of the narrative. If any moral purpose must be assigned to this digression, it would rather be to suggest that the people had some real temptation to complain. It is often forgotten that, although the manna was supernatural, at least as to the amount and regularity of its supply, yet as an article of food it contained no supernatural elements. If we had to live upon nothing but cakes flavored with honey or with olive oil, it is certain that we should soon find them pall upon our appetite. To the eye of the Psalmist the manna appeared as angels' food (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>); but then the Psalmist had not lived on manna every day for a year. We have to remember, in this as in many other cases, that the Israelites would not be "our ensamples" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>) if they had not succumbed to real temptations. As the colour of bdellium. See on Genesis 2:12. As no one knows anything at all about bdellium, this adds nothing to our knowledge of the manna. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the appearance of ice," or perhaps "of hoar-frost." As it translates bdellium in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> (carbuncle), it is probable that the comparison to ice here is due to some tradition about the manna. Taking this passage in connection with <a href="../../par/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>, we may reasonably conjecture that it was of an opalescent white, the same colour probably which is mentioned in connection with manna in <a href="../../par/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.

Nothing is more impossible adequately to describe than a fresh taste. It is sufficient to note that the two things suggested by the taste of the manna, honey and oil, present the greatest possible contrast to the heavy or savoury food which they remembered in Egypt.

Now the dew is deposited in the cool of the night beneath a clear sky, when radiation of heat goes on uninterruptedly from the earth's surface; it is clear, therefore, that the manna was let fall in some way beyond human experience from the upper air. What possible physical connection there could be between the dew and the manna we cannot tell. To the untaught mind, however, the dew seemed to come more directly than any other gift of nature from the clear sky which underlay the throne of God; and thus the Jew was led to look upon the manna too as coming to him day by day direct front the storehouse of heaven (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>).

The murmuring indeed of the people was directed against God, and against Moses as his minister. The invisible King and his visible viceroy could not be separated in the regard of the people, and their concerted exhibition of misery was intended primarily for the eye of the latter. It was, therefore, no wonder that such conduct roused the wrath of Moses, who had no right to be angry, as well as the wrath of God, who had every right to be. angry. Moses sinned because he failed to restrain his temper within the exact limits of what befits the creature, and to distinguish carefully between a righteous indignation for Cod and an angry impatience with men. But he sinned under very sore provocation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-11.htm">Numbers 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?</span> These passionate complaints were clearly wrong, because exaggerated. God had <span class="accented">not</span> thrown upon Moses the responsibility of getting the people safely into Canaan, or of providing flesh for them; and apart from these exaggerations, it was a selfish and  cowardly thing thus to dwell upon his own grievance, and to leave out of sight the grave dishonour done to God, and the awful danger incurred by the people. It was the more blameworthy in Moses because upon a former occasion he had taken upon him, with almost perilous boldness, to remonstrate with God, and to protest against the vengeance he threatened to inflict (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>). In a word, Moses forgot himself and his duty as mediator, and in his indignation at the sin of the people committed the same sin himself. It is a strong note of genuineness that so grave (and yet so natural) a fault should be recorded with such obvious simplicity. Compare the cases of Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>) and of Jonah (chapter 4).

Of what god, except the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was it ever witnessed, or could it have been ever imagined, that he should answer the passionate injustice of his servant with such forbearance and kindness? The one thing in Moses' prayer which was reasonable he allowed at once; the rest he passed over without answer or reproof, as though it had never been uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel.</span> That the number seventy has a symbolic significance in Scripture will hardly be denied (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), although it is probably futile to affix any precise meaning to it. Perhaps the leading idea of seventy is fullness, as that of twelve is symmetry (see on Exodus 15:27). The later Jews believed that there were seventy nations in the world. There is no reason, except a reckless desire to confound the sacred narrative, to identify this appointment with that narrated in <a href="../../par/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> The circumstances and the purposes appear quite distinct: those were appointed to assist Moses in purely secular matters, to share his burden as a judge; these to assist him in religious matters, to support him as a mediator; those used the ordinary gifts of wisdom, discretion, and personal authority; these the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. It is more reasonable to suppose that these seventy were the same men that went up into Mount Sinai with Moses, and saw the God of Israel, and ate of the consecrated meal of the covenant, about a year before. Unless there was some decisive reason against it, an elder who had been chosen for that high religious privilege could hardly fail to be chosen on this occasion also; an interview with God himself, so mysteriously and awfully significant, must surely have left an ineffaceable stamp of sanctity on any soul at all worthy of it. It would be natural to suppose that while the present selection was made <span class="accented">de novo</span>, the individuals selected were personally the same. Compare note on chapter Numbers 1:5, and for "the elders of Israel" see on Exodus 3:16. <span class="cmt_word">Whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and officers over them.</span> On the officers (Hebrew, <span class="accented">shoterim</span>), an ancient order in the national organization of Israel, continued from the days of bondage, see <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. The Targ. Pal. paraphrases the word <span class="accented">shoterim</span> by "who were set over them in Mizraim." The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, words so familiar to the reader of the Greek Gospels. The later Jews traced back their Sanhedrim, or grand council of seventy, to this appointment, and found their eiders and scribes in this verse. There was, however, no further historical connection between the two bodies than this - that when the monarchy failed and prophecy died out, the ecclesiastical leaders of the Jews modeled their institutions upon, and adapted their titles <span class="accented">to</span>, this Divinely-ordered original. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a></div><div class="verse">And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which <i>is</i> upon thee, and will put <i>it</i> upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear <i>it</i> not thyself alone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">take of the spirit which</span> is <span class="cmt_word">upon thee, and will put it upon them.</span> The Holy Spirit is one and indivisible. But in the language of Scripture "the Spirit" often stands for the <span class="accented">charismata</span>, or gifts of the Spirit, and in this sense is freely spoken of as belonging to this or that man. So the "spirit of Elijah" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9, 15</a>), which was transferred to Elisha, as it were, by bequest. It was <span class="accented">not</span>, therefore, the personal indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost in Moses which God caused him to share with the seventy elders, for that can in no ease be a matter of transfer or of arrangement, but simply those <span class="accented">charismata</span> or extraordinary gifts of the Spirit which Moses had hitherto enjoyed alone as the prophet of Israel. It is  strange that in the face of the clear teaching of St. Paul in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12, 13</a>, and in view of such cases as those of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; 19:93) and David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), any difficulty should have been felt about this passage. <span class="cmt_word">They shall bear the burden of the people with thee.</span> It does not appear how they were to do this, nor is there any record of their work. Their gifts, however, were spiritual, and we may probably assume that their usefulness lay in producing and maintaining a proper religious tone among the people. The real difficulty which stood in the way of Moses was not one of outward organization or of government, for that had been amply provided for; it lay in the bad tone which prevailed among the people, and threatened to destroy at any moment the very foundations of their national hope and safety. We may see in these seventy not indeed a Sanhedrim to exercise authority and discipline, but the first commencement of that prophetic order which afterwards played so large a part in the religious history of Israel and of the early Christian Church - an order designed kern the first to supplement by the freedom and originality of their ministry the more formal and unvarying offices of the priesthood. If this was the nature of their usefulness, it is not surprising that they are never mentioned again; and it is observable that a similar obscurity hangs over the activity of the prophets of the New Testament, who yet formed a most important part of the gospel <span class="accented">regime</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-32</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).

The people were to prepare themselves as for some revelation of God's holiness and majesty. In truth it was for a revelation of his wrath, and of the bitter consequences of sin. There is about the words, as interpreted by the result, a depth of very terrible meaning; it was as though a traitor, unknowing of his doom, were bidden <span class="cmt_word">to</span> a grand ceremonial on the morrow, which ceremonial should be his own execution. <span class="cmt_word">For it was well with us in Egypt.</span> These false and wicked words, in which the base ingratitude of the people reached its highest pitch, are repeated to them in the message of God with a quiet sternness which gave no sign to their callous ears of the wrath they had aroused.

The whole intention of the ceremonial was to declare in the most unmistakable way that the gifts of the seventy were to be exercised only in union with and in subordination to the mediator of Israel. The Targums are substantially correct in their paraphrase: "The Lord made <span class="accented">enlargement</span> of the spirit that was upon him, and imparted to the seventy men, the eiders." Theodoret very happily observes on this passage, "Just as a man who kindles a thousand flames from one does not lessen the first in communicating light to the others, so God did not diminish the grace imparted  to Moses by the fact that he communicated of it to the seventy." <span class="cmt_word">They</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophesied.</span> The phenomenon here mentioned for the first time was no doubt an ecstatic utterance, not exactly beyond the control, but certainly beyond the origination, of those who prophesied. It must not be confounded with that state of calm, spiritual exaltation in which such men as Isaac and Jacob spake concerning things to come (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>). The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> means literally "were caused to pour forth," and the fundamental idea is that those affected became for the time being vents for the audible utterance of thoughts and expressions which were not theirs, but the Holy Ghost's. Compare the thought in <a href="../../par/job/32-18.htm">Job 32:18-20</a>, and the case of Saul and his messengers, as above. As to the matter of these prophesyings, we may probably conclude that they were of the same nature as the ecstatic utterances of the tongues on the day of Pentecost and afterwards; not "prophecy" in the ordinary sense, but inspired glorification of God, and declaration of his wonderful works (<a href="../../par/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">did not cease.</span> Rather, "did not add," or "repeat." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>.

The ecstatic utterance did not continue or reappear. The New Testament history no doubt supplies us with the explanation of this. The supernatural sign thus accorded was of little use in itself, and was of much danger, because it attracted to its exhibition an attention which was rather due to more inward and spiritual things. As a sign it was sufficient that it should be once unmistakably manifested before all the people. (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-8.htm">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). The permanent <span class="accented">charisma</span> of the Holy Spirit which the seventy received and retained from this time forth was no doubt the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; the gift of "help" or "governance," not in temporal matters, but in the religious education and direction of the people.

Probably he did not know that they had been enrolled, and he was naturally jealous for the honour of Moses - a jealousy which was not at all unnecessary, as the events of the next chapter proved.

Either the sudden cessation of the gale, or a violent eddying of the wind, threw the exhausted birds in myriads upon the camp (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits high upon the face of the</span> earth. The word "high" is not in the original, but it probably gives the true meaning.

The Targums assert that the quails "flew upon the face of the ground, at a height of two cubits;" and this is followed by the Vulgate ("<span class="accented">volabant in acre duobus cubitis altiludine super terram"</span>) and by many commentators. This idea, however, although suggested by the actual habits of the bird, and adopted in order to avoid the obvious difficulty of the statement, is inconsistent with the expressions used here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. If the birds were "thrown" upon the camp, or "rained" upon it like sand, they could not have been flying steadily forward a few feet above the ground. It is certainly impossible to take the statement literally, for such a mass of birds would have been perfectly unmanageable; but if we suppose that they were drifted by the wind into heaps, which in places reached the height of two cubits, that will satisfy the exigencies of the text: anything like a uniform depth would be the last thing to be expected under the circumstances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the people stood up all that day, and all <i>that</i> night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread <i>them</i> all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people stood up...  next day.</span> A statement which shows us how greedy the people were, and how inordinately eager to supply themselves with an abundance of animal food. They were so afraid of losing any of the birds that they stayed up all night in order to collect them; probably they only ceased gathering and began to cat when the available supply was spent. <span class="cmt_word">Ten homers.</span> It is difficult to calculate the capacity of the homer, especially as it may have varied from age to age. If it contained ten ephahs, as seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>, and if the estimate of the Rabbinists (which is less than that of Josephus) be correct that the ephah held nearly four and a half gallons of liquid measure, then half a million of men must have collected more quails apiece than would have filled a 450 gallon tub. No doubt the total number was something enormous, and far above anything that could have been supplied by natural agencies. The gift of quails, like that of manna, was one of the gifts of nature proper to that region Divinely multiplied and extended, so as to show forth in the most striking way the boundless power and beneficence of God. <span class="cmt_word">They spread them all abroad.</span> In order to dry them in the sun, as the Egyptians used to do with fish (Herod., 2:77), and as the South Americans do with beef. Flesh thus cured does not need salt, which the Israelites would not have in sufficient quantities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a></div><div class="verse">And while the flesh <i>was</i> yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed. If</span> this were taken in the most literal sense, it would mean that no one of the people had time to swallow a single morsel of the coveted food ere he was stricken down by the Divine visitation. <span class="accented">We can scarcely imagine, however</span>, that such was the case in every single instance. It would indeed appear as if they had with one consent postponed the enjoyment of eating the quails until they had gathered as huge a quantity for future use as possible; as if in defiance and contempt of the Divine warning that their greed would turn to satiety and loathing (see verses 19 and 32). If this were so, then the feast to which they so eagerly looked forward would begin throughout the camps on the second night, and the visitation of God might well have had the sudden and simultaneous character attributed to it here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30, 31</a>. At any rate the statement of the text positively excludes the idea that they went on eating quails for a whole month, according to the promise (or threat) of verse 20. There was flesh enough to have secured the literal fulfillment of that promise by gorging them for a whole month; but it is evident that the Divine wrath anticipated any such tardy revenges, and smote its victims in the very moment of their keenest gratification. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord smote the people with a very great plague.</span> Both ancients and moderns state that the flesh of quails is unwholesome (cf. Pliny, 10:23), but this appears to have no very valid foundation. Unquestionably quails eaten for a month by people unused to a flesh diet would produce many and fatal sicknesses; but there is no room for any such natural results here. Whatever form the plague may have taken, it was as clearly supernatural in its suddenness and intensity as the supply of quails itself. We do not know anything as to who were smitten, or how many; the Psalmist tells us that they were "the fattest" and "the chosen in Israel, and we may naturally suppose that those who had been foremost in the lusting  and the murmuring were foremost in the ruin which followed.

It is utterly uncertain where it lay, except that it was apparently the terminus of a three days' journey from Sinai, and in the desert of Paran. How long they stayed at Kibroth-Hattaavah is also quite uncertain. If the plague followed hard upon the coming of the quails, a few days would suffice for all the events recorded in this chapter, and we may well believe that the people would be only too glad to receive the signal of departure as soon as they had buried their unhappy brethren. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And abode at Hazeroth.</span> Or, "were in Hazeroth."

Hazeroth, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shut in, means "enclosures;" so named perhaps from some ancient stone enclosures erected by wandering tribes for their herds and flocks. It has been identified with Ain el Hadhera, a fountain eighteen hours northeast of Sinai, but on no satisfactory grounds beyond a partial resemblance of name. Assuming that the march lay in a northerly direction through the desert of Paran, the Israelites would naturally follow the road which leads across the southern mountain barrier of et-Tih, and on by the Wady es-Zulakeh into the desert plateau. On this road there is a large fountain, with pasturage, at a place called el Ain, and another somewhat further at Bit ed-Themmed. One or other of these was probably the site of Hazeroth (cf. Stanley, 'Sinai,' page 84). It is, however, entirely a matter of conjecture, and of little real interest. The progress of Israel which is of unfading importance to us is a moral and religious, and not a geographical, progress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/12.htm"><title>Numbers 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/11.htm" title="Numbers 11">&#9668;</a> Numbers 12 <a href="../numbers/13.htm" title="Numbers 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Miriam</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Aaron spake against Moses.</span> While the people were encamped at Hazeroth (see verse 16), and therefore probably very soon after the events of the last chapter.

Superior to his brother in certain gifts, he was as inferior to him in force of character as could well be. On the present occasion there can be little question that Aaron simply allowed himself to be drawn by his sister into an opposition with which he had little personal sympathy; a general discontent at the manifest inferiority of his position inclined him to take up her quarrel, and to echo her complaints. <span class="cmt_word">Because of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</span> Hebrew, a Cushite woman. The descendants of Cush were distributed both in Africa (the Ethiopians proper) and in Asia (the southern Arabians, Babylonians, Ninevites, &c.). See <a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. Some have thought that this Ethiopian woman was none other than the Midianite Zipporah, who might have been called a Cushite in some loose sense by Miriam. The historian, however, would not have repeated in his own name a statement so inaccurate; nor is it at all likely that that marriage would have become a matter of contention after so many years. The natural supposition undoubtedly is that Moses (whether after the death of Zipporah, or during her lifetime, we cannot tell) had taken to himself a second wife of Hamite origin. Where he found her it is useless to conjecture; she may possibly have been one of the "mixed multitude" that went up out of Egypt. It is equally useless to attribute any moral or religious character to this marriage, of which Holy Scripture takes no direct notice, and which was evidently regarded by Moses as a matter of purely private concern to himself. In general we may say that the rulers of Israel attached neither political, social, nor religious significance to their marriages; and that neither law nor custom imposed any restraint upon their choice, so long as they did not ally themselves with the daughters of Canaan (see <a href="../../par/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>). It would be altogether beside the mark to suppose that Moses  deliberately married a Cushite woman in order to set forth the essential fellowship between Jew and Gentile. It is true that such marriages as those of Joseph, of Salmon, of Solomon, and others undeniably became invested with spiritual importance and evangelical significance, in view of the growing narrowness of Jewish feeling, and of the coming in of a wider dispensation; but such significance was wholly latent at the time. If, however, the choice of Moses is inexplicable, the opposition of Miriam is intelligible enough. She was a prophetess (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), and strongly imbued with those national and patriotic feelings which are never far removed from exclusiveness and pride of race. She had - to use modern words - led the Te Deum of the nation after the stupendous overthrow of the Egyptians. And now her brother, who stood at the head of the nation, had brought into his tent a Cushite woman, one of the dark-skinned race which seemed oven lower in the religious scale than the Egyptians themselves. Such an alliance might easily seem to Miriam nothing better than an act of apostasy which would justify any possible opposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us?

This is their justification of themselves for daring to dispute his judgment and arraign his proceedings; a thing which clearly required justification. Moses himself, or more likely others for him, had remonstrated with them on the language they were using. They retorted that Moses had no monopoly of Divine communications; Aaron also received the revelation of God by Urim and Thummim, and Miriam was a prophetess. They were acknowledged in a general sense as sharing with him the leadership of Israel (see <a href="../../par/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>); upon this they meant to found a claim to coordinate authority. They would have had perhaps all matters settled in a family council in which they should have had an equal voice. It was hard for them both to forget that Moses was only their younger brother: for Miriam that she had saved his <span class="accented">life</span> as an infant; for Aaron that he had been as prominent as Moses in the original commission from God to the people. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord heard it.</span> In one sense he hears everything; in another sense there are many things which he does not choose to hear, because he does not wish to take judicial notice of them. Thus he had not "heard" the passionate complaints of Moses himself a short time before, because his will was then to pardon, not to punish (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">(Now the man Moses <i>was</i> very meek, above all the men which <i>were</i> upon the face of the earth.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</span> For the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> here; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">mitis.</span> The Targum Palestine has "bowed down in his mind," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, overwhelmed ("plagued," Luther). The ordinary version is undoubtedly' right; the object of the parenthesis was either to explain that there was no real ground for the hostility of Miriam and Aaron, or to show that the direct interference of the Lord himself was necessary for the protection of his servant. The verse bears a difficulty on its very face, because it speaks of Moses in terms which could hardly have been used by Moses of himself. Nor is this difficulty in the least degree diminished by the explanations which are offered by those who are determined to maintain at any cost the Mosaic authorship of every word in the Pentateuch. It is no doubt true to some extent that when a great and good man is writing of himself (and especially when he writes under the influence of the Holy Spirit), he can speak of himself with the same calm and simple truthfulness with which he would speak of any other. It is sufficient, however, to refer to the example of St. Paul to show that neither any height of spiritual privilege and authority, nor any intensity of Divine inspiration, obliterates the natural virtue of modesty, or allows a really humble man to praise himself without pain and shrinking. It is also to be observed that while St. Paul forces himself to speak of his privileges, distinctions, and sufferings, all of which were outward to himself, Moses would here be claiming for himself the possession of an inward virtue in greater measure than any other living soul. Surely it is not too much to say that if he did possess it in such measure, he could not possibly have been conscious that he did; only One was thus conscious of his own ineffable superiority, and this very consciousness is one of the strongest arguments for believing that he was infinitely more than a mere man, howsoever good and exalted. There is but one theory that will make it morally possible for Moses to have written this verse, viz., that in writing he was a mere instrument, and not morally responsible for what he did write. Such a theory will find few upholders. But, further, it is necessary to prove not only that Moses might have made this statement, but also that he might have made it in this form. Granted that it was necessary to the narrative to point out that he was very meek; it was <span class="accented">not</span> necessary to assert that he was absolutely the meekest man living. And if it was unnecessary, it was also unnatural. No good man would go out of his way to compare himself to his own advantage with all men upon the face of the earth.  The whole form of the sentence, indeed, as well as its position, proclaim it so clearly to be an addition by some later hand, that the question may be left to the common sense and knowledge of human nature of every reader; for the broad outlines of human character, morality, and virtue are the same in every age, and are not displaced by any accident of position, or even of inspiration. A slight examination of passages from other sacred writers, which are sometimes adduced as analogous, will serve to show how profound is the difference between what holy men <span class="accented">could</span> say of themselves and what they <span class="accented">could not</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>). On the question of the inspiration of this verse, supposing it to be an interpolation, and as to the probable author of it, see the Preface. As to the fact of Moses' meekness, we have no reason to doubt it, but we may legitimately look upon the form in which it is stated as one of those conventional hyperboles which are not uncommon even in the sacred writings (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/7-19.htm">Genesis 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). And we cannot avoid perceiving that Moses' meekness was far from being perfect, and was marred by sinful impatience and passion on more than one recorded occasion.

On the other hand, the phrase must certainly be understood to mean the entrance of the court, or sacred enclosure, in <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-3.htm">Leviticus 8:3, 31, 33</a>, and probably in other places. As it is hardly possible that the phrase can have had both meanings, the latter must be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And they both came forth.</span> Not out of the sanctuary, into which Miriam could not have entered, but out of the enclosure.

An internal vision, in which the eyes (even if open) saw nothing, but the effects of vision' were produced upon the sensorium by other and supernatural means (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>). Speak unto him in a dream. Rather, speak "in him" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>. The voice that spake to the prophet was an internal voice, causing no vibration of the outer air, but affecting only the inner and hidden seat of consciousness. It is not necessary to restrict the prophetic dream to the time of sleep; a waking state, resembling what we call day-dream, in which the external senses arc quiescent, and the imagination is freed from its usual restraints, was perhaps the more usual mental condition at the time. Indeed the Divine communications made to Joseph (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>) and to the Magi (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="../../par/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>) are almost the only ones we read of as made during actual sleep, unless we include the case of Pilate's wife (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="../../par/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a>); and none of these were prophets in the ordinary sense.

It is strange that, in the face of a statement so general and so emphatic, it should have been doubted whether it applied to such prophets as Isaiah or Daniel. It was exactly in "visions" and in "dreams," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, under the peculiar psychological conditions so-called, that these greatest of prophets received their revelations from heaven. The exceeding richness and wonder of some of these revelations did not alter the mode in which they were received, nor raise them out of the ordinary conditions of the <span class="accented">gradus propheticus.</span> As prophets of future things they were much greater than Moses, and their writings may be to us far more precious; but that does not concern the present question, which turns exclusively upon the relation between the Divine Giver and the human receiver of the revelation. If words mean anything, the assertion here is that Moses stood on an altogether different footing from the "prophet of the Lord" in respect of the communications which he received from the Lord. It is this essential superiority of position on the part of Moses which alone gives force and meaning to the important declarations of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a> b.; John 6:14; 7:40, &c.

The "house" of God, as the adjective "whole" shows, is not the tabernacle, but the house of Israel; the' word "house" standing for household, family, nation, as so often in the sacred writings (see <a href="../../par/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mouth to mouth.</span> Equivalent to face to face in <a href="../../par/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>. What the exact facts of the case were it is not possible to know, scarcely to imagine; but the words seem to imply a familiar speaking with an audible voice on the part of God, as distinguished from the internal voice, inaudible to the ear, with which he spake "in" the prophets. To assert that the revelations accorded to Moses were only subjective modifications of his own consciousness is to evacuate these strong words of any meaning whatever. <span class="cmt_word">Apparently.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) is an accusative in apposition to what goes before by way (apparently) of further definition. It is the same word translated "vision" in verse 6; but its meaning here must be determined by the expression "in riddles," which stands in antithesis to it. It was confessed]y the case with most prophetic utterances that the language in which they were couched was quite as much intended to conceal as to express their full meaning; but to Moses God spake without any such concealments. <span class="cmt_word">The similitude</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord shall he behold.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Not the essential nature of God, which no man can see, but a form (wholly unknown and unimaginable to us) in which it pleased him to veil his glory. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, referring, apparently, to the vision promised in <a href="../../par/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; and the Targum Palestine speaks here of the vision of the burning bush. The motive for this alteration is no doubt to be sought in a profound jealousy for the great truth declared in such texts as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, and afterwards in <a href="../../par/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. But the statement in the text is a general one, and can only mean that Moses habitually in his intercourse with God had before his eyes some visible manifestation of the invisible God, which helped to make that intercourse at once more awfully real and more intensely blessed. Such manifestation to the sense of sight must be distinguished both from the visionary (or subjective) sight of God in human figure accorded to Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), to Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), to St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2, 8</a>), and perhaps to others, and also from such theophanies in angel guise as are recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-9.htm">Judges 13:9, 2</a>, and elsewhere. On the other hand, the seventy elders seem to have seen the "Temunah" of the Lord upon that one occasion when they <span class="cmt_word">were</span> called up into Mount Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses! No</span> doubt it was the double fact of their relationship to Moses after the flesh, and of their sharing with him in certain spiritual gifts and prerogatives, which made them oblivious of the great distinction which lifted him above their rivalry, and should have lifted him above their contradiction. That contradiction, however, served to bring out in the clearest way the singular and unapproached position of the mediator of Israel; and it serves still to enable us to estimate aright the peculiar dignity of his legislation and his writings. The substance of prophetic teaching may be of deeper interest and of wider import titan "the law," but this latter will still rank higher in the scale of inspiration, as having been more directly communicated front on high. Thus "the law" (as the Jews rightly taught) remained the body of Divine revelation until "that Prophet" came who was "like unto" Moses in the fact that he enjoyed constant, open, and direct communication with the Godhead.

The Levitical legislation had made it more terrible by affixing to it the penalty of religious and social excommunication, and the stigma, as it were, of the Divine displeasure.

What Aaron really prays for is that the sin, which he frankly confesses, may not be imputed to them. The Levitical law had taught them to look upon sin as a burden, which in the nature of things the sinner must carry, but which by the goodness of God might be got rid of, or transferred to some one else (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).

The Targums have, "if her father had corrected her." Probably they used this euphemism from a sense of a certain want of dignity and propriety in the original expression, considered as coming from the mouth of God. The act in question was, however, not uncommon in itself, and in significance clearly marked (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>). It was the distinctive note of public disgrace inflicted by one who had a right to inflict it. In the <span class="accented">case</span> of a father, it meant that he was thoroughly ashamed of his child, and judged it best (which would be only in extreme cases) to put his child to shame before all the world. So public a disgrace would certainly be felt in patriarchal times as a most severe calamity, and entailed by ordinary custom (as we learn here) retirement and mourning for seven days at least. How much more, when her heavenly Father had been driven to inflict a public disgrace upon her for perverse behavior, should the shame and the sorrow not be lightly put away,, but patiently endured for a decent period!

It is important to note that the Divine inspiration did not in the least prevent two sacred authors (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>), or even the same author at different times, from placing on record very distinct and even strongly contrasted aspects of the same facts, according to the point of view from which he was led to regard them. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, Moses reminds the people that on their arrival at Kadesh he had bidden them go up and take possession; that <span class="accented">they</span> had then proposed to send men before them to examine the land; that the proposal had pleased him so well that he had adopted it and acted upon it. It is unquestionably strange that facts so material should have been omitted in the historical Book of Numbers. It is, however, to be considered - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That there is no contradiction between the two accounts. We may be certain from many a recorded example that Moses would not have acted on the popular suggestion without referring the matter to the Lord, and that it would be the Divine command (when given) which would really weigh with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the recital in Deuteronomy is distinctly <span class="accented">ad populum</span>, and that therefore their part in the whole transaction is as strongly emphasized as is consistent with the truth of the facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the narrative of Numbers is fragmentary, and does not profess to give a full account of matters, especially in such particulars  as do not directly concern the Divine government and guidance of Israel. It is not, therefore, a serious difficulty that the record only begins here at the point when God adopted as his own what had been the demand of the people. If we ask why he so adopted it, the probable answer is that he knew what secret disaffection prompted it, and to what open rebellion it would lead. It was better that such disaffection should be allowed to ripen into rebellion before they entered their promised land. Miserable as the desert wandering might be, it was yet a discipline which prepared the nation for better things; whereas the invasion of Canaan without strong faith, courage, and self-restraint (such as they showed under Joshua) could but have ended in national disaster and destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man.</span> This was not part of the original proposition (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>), but was agreeable to the general practice in matters of national concern, and was no doubt commanded in order that the whole people might share in the interest and responsibility of this survey. Every one a ruler among them. This does not mean that they were to be the tribe princes (as the names show), for they would not be suitable in respect of age, nor could they be spared for this service. They were "heads of the children of Israel" (verse 3), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, men of position and repute, but also no doubt comparatively young and active, as befitted a toilsome and hazardous excursion.

It was afterwards contracted into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> (Jeshua; cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>), and has come to us in its current form through the Vulgate. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and so the name appears in the New Testament. It is an obvious difficulty that Joshua has already been called by his new name at <a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>, and in every other place where he has been mentioned. In fact he is only once elsewhere called Hoshea, and that in a place (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>) where we should certainly not have expected it. There are two ways of explaining the difficulty, such as it is. We may suppose that the change of name was really made at this time, as the narrative seems (on the face of it) to assert; and then the previous mentions of Joshua by his subsequent and more familiar name will be cases of that anticipation which is so common in Scripture (cf., <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a>). Or we may suppose, what is perhaps more in harmony with the course of Joshua's life, that the change bad been already made at the time of the victory over Amalek. In that case the Vav consec. in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (and...  called) must be referred to the order of thought, not of time, and a sufficient reason must be shown for the interpolation of the statement in this particular place. Such a reason may fairly be found in the probable fact that the names of the spies were copied out of the tribal registers, and that Joshua still appeared under his original name in those registers. As to the significance of the change, it is not easy to estimate it aright. On the one hand, the sacred syllable entered into so many of the Jewish names that it could not have seemed a very marked change; on the other hand, the fact that our Saviour received the same name because he was our Saviour throws a halo of glory about it which we cannot ignore. In the Divine providence Hoshea became Joshua because he was destined to be the temporal saviour of his people, and to lead them into their promised rest.

There seems to be but one marked natural feature which could have been chosen for that purpose - the broad sandy depression called the Wady Murreh, which divides the mountain mass of the Azazimeh from the Rakhmah plateau, the southern extremity of the highlands of Judah.

Hamath, now Hamah, was in Greek times Epiphaneia, on the Orontes, outside the limits of Jewish rule. The southern entrance to it lay between the ranges of Libanus and Anti-libanus (see note on Numbers 34:8). The Rehob here mentioned is not likely to have been either of the Rehobs in the territory of Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28-30</a>), but the Beth-rehob further to the east, and near to where Dan-Laish was afterwards built (<a href="../../par/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>).

The Beni-Anak (Beni-Anakim in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>; Anakim in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>, &c.) were a tribe whose remote and perhaps legendary ancestor was Anak son of Arba (see on Joshua 14:15). These three chiefs of the Beni-Anak are said to have been expelled from Hebron fifty years later by Caleb (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-20.htm">Judges 1:20</a>). The gigantic size which the Anakim shared with the Emim and Rephaim, other remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants, may have been accompanied by remarkable longevity; or they may have been quite young at the time of this visit; or, finally, they may not have been individuals at all, but families or clans. <span class="cmt_word">Now Hebron was built seven years before Zean in Egypt.</span> Hebron was in existence at the time of Abraham. Zoan was Tanis, near the mouth of the eastern branch of the Nile (see on Psalm 78:12, 43). If it be true that the Pharaoh of the exodus had his royal residence at Zoan, Moses may have had access to the archives of the city, or he may have learnt the date of its foundation from the priests who gave him his Egyptian education. That there was any real connection between the two places is extremely problematical, nor is it possible to give any reason for the abrupt insertion here of a fragment of history so minute and in itself so unimportant. There is, however, no one but Moses to whom the statement can with any sort of likelihood be traced; a later writer could have had no authority for making the statement, and no possible reason for inventing it.

Joshua was the special companion and minister of Moses, his <span class="accented">alter ego</span> in those things wherein he was employed: for that reason he may very well have given place to Caleb as a more impartial witness, and one more likely to be listened to in the present temper of the people; for it is evident from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, that that temper had already declared itself for evil (see on Numbers 14:24).

But the existence of numerous walled and fortified towns was (apart from Divine aid) an almost insuperable obstacle to a people wholly ignorant of artillery or of siege operations; and the presence of giants was exceedingly terrifying in an age when battles were a series of personal encounters (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11, 24</a>).

There is no certainty that the Nephilim had been giants, and no likelihood whatever that the Beni-Anak had any real connection with them. As grasshoppers. We have no means of judging of the actual size of these men, unless the height assigned to Goliath (six cubits and a span) be allowed to them. Probably men of this stature were quite exceptional even among the Anakim.

They had lamented that they had not died in Egypt, and they had wished themselves back in Egypt, but they had never proposed to take any overt steps towards returning thither. Nothing less than an entire and deliberate revolt was involved in the wish to elect a captain for themselves, for the angel of the covenant was the Captain of the Lord's host (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>).

We cannot, however, regard this offer as embodying a deliberate intention, for we know that God did not really mean to cast off Israel; nor can we regard it as expressing the anger of the moment, for it is not of God to be hasty. We must understand it distinctly as intended to try the loyalty and charity of Moses, and to give him an opportunity of rising to the loftiest height of magnanimity, unselfishness, and courage. Moses would unquestionably have been less noble than he was if he had listened to the offer; it is therefore certain that the offer was only made in order that it might be refused (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>).

Had Moses been ever so eloquent, a facility of speech at such a moment would have been alike unnatural and unlovely. What we can see in the words is this: that Moses had no thought for himself, and that it never occurred to him to entertain the tempting offer made to him by God; that he knew God too well, and (if we may say so) cared for God too much, to let him so compromise his honour  among the nations, and so thwart his own purposes, without making one effort (however audacious) to turn his wrath aside. We can see that it is (as in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11, 12</a>, only much more boldly and abruptly) the thought of what the heathen would say which he wishes to thrust upon the Almighty; but we cannot be sure of the right translation of the words. The most literal rendering would seem to be, "Both the Egyptians have heard (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) that thou broughtest out this people from among them with thy might, and they have told it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) to the inhabitants of this land; they have heard (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, repeated) that thou, Lord, art amongst this people," &c.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a></div><div class="verse">But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servant Caleb.</span> Caleb alone is mentioned here, as if he were the only exception to the sentence just passed upon the generation which came out of Egypt. Taken in connection with <a href="../../par/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>, and in contrast with <a href="../../par/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6, 30, 38</a>, it has been supposed to point to the interweaving here of two narratives, from the one of which the name of Joshua was intentionally omitted (see the Introduction). The fact, however, is that Joshua is not the only, nor the most remarkable, exception to the general sentence which is not specified here. Moses and Aaron themselves were undoubtedly not included in that sentence at this time, although they afterwards came under the severity of it (see on Deuteronomy 1:37). Eleazar, the priest, was one of those who entered with Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>), and it is vain to argue that he might have been under twenty at the time of the numbering (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/4-16.htm">Numbers 4:16</a>). There is, indeed, every reason to believe that the whole tribe of Levi were excepted from the punishment, because they were not compromised in the guilt. They had no representative among the spies, nor were they called upon to go up and fight; moreover, they had been steadily loyal to Moses since the matter of the golden calf. But if the <span class="accented">exception</span> of the Levites was taken for granted, and passed without mention, much more might the exception of Joshua. He did not stand by any means in the same position as Caleb and the other spies; he was the "minister" and lieutenant of Moses, whose fortunes were obviously bound up, not with those of his tribe, but with those of his master. If Moses had accepted the Divine offer to make him the head of a new chosen race, no doubt Joshua would have been given to him. His subsequent  separation as leader, not of Ephraim, but of Israel, was already anticipated in the singularity, at least, of his position. Caleb, on the other hand, was merely a chieftain of the tribe of Judah, with nothing to distinguish him from the mass of the people but his own good conduct. There is, therefore, nothing perplexing in the fact that Caleb alone is mentioned in this place, and nothing to warrant the assumption of a double narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Another spirit.</span> The spirit which possessed and prompted Caleb was no doubt the Holy Spirit, just as the spirit which moved the rebellion was an evil spirit (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>); but how far any such personality is here attributed to the "spirit" is hard to determine. <span class="cmt_word">Hath followed me fully.</span> Literally, "fulfilled to walk behind me." Caleb treasured up this testimony with natural pride (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his seed shall possess it,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a portion of it and in it. No mention is made here of any special heritage, nor is it clear from <a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-13</a> that Caleb received any definite promise of Hebron. He spoke indeed of a promise made him, probably at this time, by Moses; but that promise was a very general one. He asked for "this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day;" but he may only have referred to the Divine command first to explore and then to occupy "the mountain," as the nearest portion of the promised land.

But if "Canaanite" means "Phoenician" in chapter Numbers 13:29, it is difficult to maintain that it is here equivalent to "Amorite." Again, if "Canaanite" be taken in this vaguer sense, yet it is clear that the Amorites dwelt in "the mountain" (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, verse 45 with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), and not in the lowlands. This has been got over by supposing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> may mean an upland vale, or plateau, such as that to which the Israelites presently ascended. It is, however, a straining of the word to assign such a meaning to it. It is rightly translated by the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>. And even if one looking down from above might call an upland plain by this name, yet certainly one looking up from below would not. If the word stands rightly in this place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> must mean "in the Wady Murreh," the broad sandy strait which bounded the "mountain of the Amorite" on the south. If so, we must conclude that not only the roving Amalekites, but also the Canaanites, or Amorites, had established themselves in some parts of the Wady. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is scarcely credible that an observation of this sort, which would seem unusual and abrupt in any speech, should have formed a part of God's message to Moses. It has no apparent connection with the context. It does not (as often alleged) afford a reason for the command which follows; it was not at all because enemies were already in possession before them that the Israelites had to turn their backs upon the promised land, but because God had withdrawn for the time his promised aid. If the "valley" be the Rakhmah plateau, they had always known that hostile tribes held it, and that they would have to conquer them. That the words are an interpolation, as the A.V. represents them, seems as certain as internal evidence can make it; lint by whom made, and with what intent, is a question which will probably never be answered. It may be worth while to hazard a conjecture that the interpolated words are really connected with what goes before, viz., the promise of inheritance to Caleb. Now that promise was fulfilled in the gift of Hebron to Caleb and his seed (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-14.htm">Joshua 14:14</a>). But we have express mention in <a href="../../par/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a> of the "vale of Hebron," and the same word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, is used in the Hebrew. Is it not possible that this parenthesis was originally the gloss of one who had a special interest in the heritage of Caleb, and wished to note that at the time it was given to him "the vale" was occupied by two hostile peoples? Into <span class="cmt_word">the wilderness,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Sinaitic peninsula, as distinguished from Palestine on the one hand, and from Egypt on the other. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the Red Sea,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, towards the Red Sea; here apparently the Elanitic Gulf (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>).

That the Jews were guilty of idolatry in the wilderness is distinctly asserted (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42, 43</a>); and these idolatrous practices, carried on no doubt in secret, must have been a sore trial to the generation which grew up amidst them (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14, 23</a>).

Exactly for this reason it was the better fitted to fix itself in the mind of a nation incapable of following a deeper and more spiritual analogy of guilt and punishment. It served the purpose which God had in view, viz., to make them feel that the quantity as well as the quality of their punishment was entirely due to themselves; and it needed no other justification. If God assigns reasons at all, he assigns such as can be understood by those to whom he speaks. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall know</span> <span class="cmt_word">my breach of promise.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>.

Again, if the Seir of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a> be the country usually so called, we must suppose that the Edomites had at this time occupied a part of the Azazimeh, contiguous to the Wady Murreh, and westwards of the Arabah. We should then represent the Israelites to ourselves as being driven off the mountain, and across the Wady Murreh, and cut down in the mountains beyond, as far as a place called Hormah, perhaps from this very slaughter. Others have found Hormah (or Zephath, <a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>) and Seir among the multitudinous names of past or present habitation in the south of Palestine; the perplexing resemblances of which, coupled with the vagueness of the sacred narrative, lead to the rise of as many different theories as there are commentators. It must, however, be erroneous to represent this hasty incursion of the Israelites, without their leaders, and without their daily food from heaven, as a campaign in which they advanced for a considerable distance, and were only partially expelled at last. It is clear from this passage, and still more from the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, that the expedition was swiftly and ignominiously repelled and avenged. Compare the expression, "chased you as bees do." <span class="ref_word">NOTE TO CHAPTERS XIII, XIV ON THE POSITION OF KADESH AND THE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE ISRAELITES.</span> The old name of Kadesh was En-mishpat (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>), or the "Well of Judgment." Its later and more familiar name was equivalent to "the sanctuary" or "holy place" (compare the Arabic name for Jerusalem, "El Kuds"). It is possible that it received this name from the long sojourn of the tabernacle in its neighbourhood (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-46.htm">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>); but it is more likely that it possessed some character of sanctity from ancient times, a character which would very well harmonize with the fact that justice was administered there. It is evident that in order to obtain any clear and connected idea of the history of Israel between the departure from Sinai and the encampment upon the plains of Moab, it is above all necessary to fix approximately the position of this place, which for one generation was the most important place in the whole world. It was no doubt from the neighbourhood of Kadesh that the spies were sent, and it was certainly to Kadesh that they returned from searching the land (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>). From Kadesh the first disastrous attempt was made to invade the country, and from thence again the final journey began which led the nation round the coasts of Edom to the plains of Moab. Thus Kadesh was of all places, next to Mount Sinai, the one associated with the most momentous events of those momentous years, marking at once the terminus of their first journey (which should have been their last), the beginning of their tedious wanderings, and the starting point of their final march. So far, however, from there being any certainty or agreement as to the site of Kadesh, we find two sites proposed widely separated from one another, each maintained and each assailed by powerful arguments, which divide between them the suffrages of geographers and commentators; and besides these there are others less powerfully supported. The view adopted in the notes to this book is that of the travelers Rowland and Williams, and of the great majority of the German commentators: it is fully stated and minutely argued in Kurtz's 'History of the Old Covenant' (volume 3 in Clark's 'Foreign Theol. Lib.'). According to these authorities Kadesh is to be recognized in the plain and fountain of Kudes, just within the north-west corner of the mountains  of the Azazimeh (see note on Numbers 10:12). This desert plain, some ten miles by six in extent, is screened from ordinary observation by the outer mountain walls of the Azazimat, which shut it off on the west from the desert road from Sinai to Hebron, on the north from the Wady Murreh. At the north-east of the plain is a bold and bare rock, a promontory of the northern mountain rampart, from the. foot of which issues a copious spring, which begins by falling in cascades into the bed of a torrent, and ends by losing itself in the sands. Amongst the Wadys which open into the plain is one which bears the name of Redemat (see note on Numbers 12:16). It is uncertain whether there is any easy communication between this plain and the Wady Murreh, but there are several passes on the western side which lead by a slight circuit to the southern table-lands of Palestine. The view adopted by the majority of English commentators is that of the traveler Robinson. According to these authorities Kadesh must be sought in the Arabah, the broad depression which runs northward from the head of the Elanitic Gulf until it meets the Ghor below the Dead Sea. By most of those who hold this view the site of Kadesh is placed at Ain-el-Weibeh, ten miles to the north of Mount Hor, and opposite the opening (from the east)of the Wady el Ghuweir, which affords the only easy passage through Edom to the north-west. Others, however, prefer Ain Hash, a few miles further north. The local peculiarities of either place are such as to satisfy the requirements of the narrative, although they would not by themselves have recalled the scenes with which Kadesh is associated. Of other theories none perhaps need to be considered here, because none can reasonably enter into competition with the two already mentioned; they avoid none of the difficulties with which these are beset, while they incur others of their own. If, indeed, Rabbinical tradition (followed in this case by Jerome) were worth anything, it would decide the question in favour of Petra, the Aramaic name of which (Rekem) uniformly takes the place of Kadesh in the Syriac and Chaldee, and in the Talmud. Kadesh-Barnea in the Targums is Rekem-Geiah. Petra itself (of which the ancient name apparently was Selah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>), the very word used in <a href="../../par/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10, 11</a>) stands in a gorge famous for its giant cliffs, still called the Wady Musa, concerning which the local tradition is that it was cleft by the rod of Moses. But apart from these resemblances of name, which are so fallacious, and these legends, which are so worthless, there is absolutely nothing to connect Kadesh with Petra; on the contrary, the position of Petra, far away from Palestine, on the skirts of Mount Hor, and in the heart of Edom, distinguish it sharply from the Kadesh of the Bible story. The two can only be identified on the supposition that the sacred narrative, as it stands, is mistaken and misleading. In examining briefly the arguments by which the western and eastern sites respectively are maintained and assailed, it will be better to dismiss the evidence (such as it is) afforded by modern nomenclature, which is always open to grave suspicion, and is at best of very variable value. The Wady Retemat, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, is so named from the broom plant, which is very plentiful in the peninsula, and may have lent a similar name to many another place. In favour of the western site, that of the so-called plain of Kudes, we have the following arguments in addition to the marked natural features which suggested the identification. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Previous mentions of Kadesh would certainly dispose us (in the absence of any indication that there was more than one place of that name) to look for it to the south of Palestine, and rather to the south-west than to the southeast. In <a href="../../par/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a> it is mentioned in connection with the "country of the Amalekites," which was apparently between Canaan and Egypt. In the same region we  may place with more confidence the well of Hagar (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>), which is placed between "Kadesh and Bered." It is difficult to think that this Kadesh could possibly have been in the Arabah. Gerar, again, which was certainly near to Beersheba, is placed (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>) "between Kadesh and Shut." These notices are indeed indefinite, but they certainly point to the western rather than to the eastern site. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Subsequent mentions of Kadesh point in the same direction. In chapter Numbers 34:4, 5 and <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3, 4</a> the southern frontier of Judah, which was also that of Canaan, is traced from the scorpion cliffs at the head of the Ghor to the Mediterranean (see note on the first passage). On this frontier Kadesh occurs in such a way that we should look for it not at one extremity, but somewhere about the middle of the line. The same is still more clearly the <span class="accented">case</span> in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>, where only three points are given on the southern frontier, of which Kadesh is the middle one. It is, again: very difficult to imagine that this Kadesh could have been in the Arabah. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It is a weaker argument, but still of some moment, that Kadesh is pointedly said to have been in the "wilderness of Paran" (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a>), and also to have been in or near the wilderness of Zin (chapter 13:21; 20:1). But the eastern site of Kadesh far up the Arabah does not seem to answer to this double description near]y as well as the western. The plain of Kudes is strictly within the limits of that southern desert now called et-Tih, and yet it is quite close to the Wady Murreh, which with its sandy expansions towards the east may well have been the wilderness of Zin (see note on Numbers 13:21). In favour of the eastern site, the only argument of real weight is founded upon the repeated statement that Kadesh was close upon the territory of Edom. In <a href="../../par/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, it is spoken of to the king of Edom as "a city in the uttermost of thy borders." But the only position in which the children of Israel would be at once on the borders of Canaan and on the borders of Edom as commonly understood, would be in the neighbourhood of Ain el-Weibeh, with the pass of es-Safah on their left, and the Wady Ghuweir on their right, as they looked northwards. With this agrees the statement that they came to Kadesh "by the way of Mount Seir" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>), and the fact that there is no station mentioned between Kadesh and Mount Her (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>), although the western site is seventy miles from that mountain. The necessity indeed of placing Kadesh on the border of Edom must be conclusive in favour of the eastern site, if the common assumption is correct that the name and territory of Edom were bounded westwards by the Arabah. It is, however, contended, with some show of reason, that the kings of Edom had extended their authority at this time over the country of the Azazimeh as far as the plain of Kudes. There is, at any rate, nothing improbable in this, because this great mountain fastness is almost as sharply severed from Canaan as from Mount Seir, properly so called; and in fact it never appears to have been in possession of the Canaanites. When, however, the southern boundary line is traced in detail (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1, 2, 21</a>), it is said to have extended <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "on the sides," or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, "to the borders," of Edom, and this expression can hardly be satisfied by the single point of contact at the south-east corner of Judah, especially when we consider the long list of cities which were on or near this border (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21-32</a>). Again, when the extreme southern and northern points of Joshua's conquest are mentioned (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>), the former is "the bald mountain which goeth up Seir" - a natural feature which we look for in vain (for it cannot possibly be the low line of the scorpion cliffs), unless it be the northern rampart of the Azazimat. We have seen that the Hormah to which the Israelites were repelled on their first invasion is placed (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>) "in Seir," which  can hardly be Mount Seir in its ordinary restricted sense. If the name Seir has to be sought anywhere outside of Edom proper, it would seem more natural to find it in the northern part of the wilderness of Paran, where it is said to be still common, than anywhere else. And if this extension of Edom can be established, there appears to be no further objection of any moment to the western site. Mount Hor would still be on the coast or edge of the land of Edom, because it would be the meeting-point of the two boundaries, the one striking westwards across the Arabah, the other southwards down the Arabah. The absence of any name between Kadesh and Her is not conclusive, because the people certainly made journeys of several days without any regular halt (see note on chapter Numbers 10:33). Upon the whole the question may fairly be stated thus: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The general tenor of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the host of Israel had marched from Sinai through the midst of the desert of Paran, by the route which led most directly to the extreme south of Palestine; and if they did this, they must have passed near to Rowland's Kadesh. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The natural features of this site, its position with regard to the desert of et-Tih and the Wady Murreh, its distance from Sinai (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>), and its proximity to the Negeb and the plateau of Rakhmah, seem to harmonize better with all that we read about Kadesh than the corresponding characteristics of the rival site. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The general effect of the various mentions of Kadesh, both before and after, is undeniably, though not decidedly, in favour of the western site. <p><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The minor arguments which are urged on one side or the other may be allowed to balance one another, for it is certain that neither is free from difficulty. <p><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The difficulty with respect to Edom is a very serious one, and with many will be decisive against Rowland's Kadesh. <p><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> What must turn the scale one way or the other is the independent evidence that the border of Edom extended at this time across the Arabah, and included the northeast portion of the desert of Paran, viz., the mountain mass which fronted the southern edge of Canaan. There is <span class="accented">some</span> evidence that this was the case, and it cannot be met by the simple assertion that the territory of Edom consisted only of Mount Seir, and that Mount Seir lay wholly to the east of the Arabah. It is to be expected that travel and research in these regions now so inaccessible, and, after all said and written, so little known, will before long bring fresh and more decisive evidence to light. In the mean time that view is consistently maintained in these notes which, if it had apparently the greatest difficulty to surmount, yet receives the greatest amount of positive support from the general and incidental testimony of the Scripture record. One lesson emerges clearly from the obscurity involving this question, which appears to us so important to the understanding of God's holy word: the geography of the Bible must be of very small importance indeed as compared with its moral and religious teachings. These are not affected by any ignorance of localities and routes. The rebellion of Kadesh has exactly the same moral for us (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-11.htm">Hebrews 4:11</a>) whether Kadesh was in the Azazimat or the Arabah; and the very uncertainty in which its site is involved may be designed to remind us that it is very easy to exaggerate the value of these outward details to the neglect of those inward teachings which alone are in the highest sense important.  <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/15.htm"><title>Numbers 15 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/15.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/15.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/15-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/14.htm" title="Numbers 14">&#9668;</a> Numbers 15 <a href="../numbers/16.htm" title="Numbers 16">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/15-1.htm">Numbers 15:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord spake unto Moses.

Why that legislation should have had the fragmentary and unfinished character which it so evidently bears, requiring to be supplemented, here by an isolated commandment, and there by oral tradition, is an interesting and difficult question; but there can be no doubt as to the fact, and it is superfluous to look any further for the reason of the enactments here following.

Perhaps it is a part of the thoroughly unscientific and inartificial character of the Mosaic legislation that a principle of extreme importance and wide application is appended to an insignificant matter of ceremonial. Provision is here made for the forgiveness of sins due to ignorance and oversight - a provision which was sorely needed, considering the great complexity of the Law, and the bad training they had for the accurate observance of it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>). A similar provision had been made in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>.

The analogy of the provision which follows (verse 27), and of the parallel provisions in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 13</a>, points clearly to the neglect of any one of the Divine commandments. <span class="cmt_word">One</span> <span class="cmt_word">young bullock for a burnt offering.</span> In the case of a sin of commission done ignorantly, the bullock was treated as a sin offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14, 20</a>), for in that case the expiation of guilt incurred is the prominent point in the atonement; in this case it is the necessity of a fresh self-dedication to the Lord.

It is maintained by some that these words were intended to mark the contrast between the previous laws, which were only to be observed when the people came into their own land, and the law of the sabbath, which was strictly enforced during the period of wandering. There is no doubt that such a distinction existed in fact, but there is no reason to find the intentional assertion of it in this expression. The simpler and more natural, and therefore more <span class="accented">probable</span>, explanation <span class="accented">is</span>, that the incident was recorded after the people had left the wilderness. At the same time, there is nothing unreasonable in ascribing the narrative to Moses himself if we suppose him to have written it at the end of his life, when the people were encamped in the steppes of Moab. It seems probable that the record of the incident was inserted here as an example of a "presumptuous" sin, and of its punishment. A man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. This was clearly presumptuous, because the prohibition to do any work for oneself on the sabbath had been made so clear, and was so constantly forced upon their attention by the failure of the manna on that day, that ignorance could not possibly be pleaded here.

There is nothing in the record as it stands here to contradict such an assumption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is more likely that it occurred after the departure from Sinai, and that the hesitation in dealing with the criminal was duo not to any real uncertainty as to the law, but to unwillingness to inflict so extreme and so (apparently) disproportioned a punishment for such an offence without a further appeal. If it be said that such unwillingness to carry out a plain command would have been sinful, it is sufficient to answer that Moses and Aaron and the elders were human beings, and must have shrunk from visiting with a cruel death the trivial breach of a purely arbitrary commandment.

This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments. The later Jews, however, have always contrived, with all their minute observance, to break the plain letter of the law: thus the modern <span class="accented">talith</span> is an under, and not an upper, garment.

It was like the facings on a uniform which recall the fame and exploits of a famous regiment. The tasseled Hebrew was a marked man in other eyes, and in his own; he could not pass himself off as one of the heathen; he was perpetually reminded of the special relation in which he stood to the Lord, whose livery (so to speak) - or, to use another simile, whose colours - he wore.

The word "took" stands alone at the head of the sentence in the singular number. This does not by itself confine its reference to Korah, because it may be taken as repeated after each of the other names; at the same time, the construction suggests that in its original form Korah alone was mentioned, and that the other names were afterwards added in order to include them in the same statement. The ellipsis after "took" (if it be one) may be filled up by "men," as in the A.V. and in most versions, or by "counsel," as in the Jerusalem Targum. The Septuagint has in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, representing apparently a different reading. Some commentators regard it as an anacoluthon for "took two hundred and fifty men...  and rose up with them;" others, again, treat the "took" as a pleonasm, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a> and elsewhere; but the change of number from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> makes it difficult. It seems best to say that the construction is broken and cannot be satisfactorily explained. Indeed there can be no question that the whole narrative, like the construction of the opening verses, is rely confused, and leaves on the mind the impression that it has been altered, not very skillfully, from its original form. The two parts of the tragedy, that concerning the company of Korah, and that concerning the Reubenites, although mingled in the narrative, do not adjust themselves in the mind, and the general effect is obscure. It is sufficient to point out here that no one can certainly tell what became of the ringleader himself, who was obviously the head and front of the whole business. Some are strenuously of opinion that he was swallowed up alive, others as strenuously that he was consumed with fire; but the simple fact is that his death is not recorded in this chapter at all, although he is assumed to have perished. The obscurity which hangs over this passage cannot be traced to any certain cause; the discrepancies and contradictions which have been discovered in it are clue to mistake or misrepresentation; nor can any evil motive be plausibly assigned for the interpolation (if it be such) of that part of the story which concerns the Reubenites. If, for some reason unknown to us, an original narrative of Korah's rebellion was enlarged so as to include the simultaneous mutiny of the Reubenites  and their fate; and if, further, that enlargement was so unskillfully made as to leave considerable confusion in the narrative, wherein does that affect either its truth or its inspiration? The supernatural influence which watched over the production of the sacred narrative certainly did not interfere with any of those natural causes which affected its composition, its style, its clearness or obscurity. <span class="cmt_word">Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi.</span> On the genealogy of the Levites see Exodus 6:16-22, and above on Numbers 3:17-19. It is generally supposed that some generations are passed over in these genealogies. Korah belonged to the same Kohathite sub-tribe as Moses and Aaron, and was related to them by some sort of cousinship; his father (or ancestor) Izhar was the younger brother of Amram and the elder brother of Uzziel, whose descendant Elizaphan had been made chief of the Kohathites. <span class="cmt_word">Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab.</span> Eliab himself was apparently the only son of Pallu, the second son of Reuben (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5, 8</a>). If the word "son" is to be literally understood in all these cases, then Korah, Dathan, and Abiram would all be great-great-grandsons of Jacob himself. <span class="cmt_word">On, the son of Peleth.</span> It is one of the strange obscurities of this narrative that On, who appears here as a ringleader, is never mentioned again either in this chapter or elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Reuben.</span> Reubenites. The encampment of their tribe was on the south side of the tabernacle in the outer line (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>), while that of the Kohathites was on the same side in the inner line. Thus they were to some extent neighbours; but see below on verse 24. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they rose up before Moses.</span> It is suggested that the Reubenites were aggrieved because their father had been deprived of his birthright in favour of Judah, and that Korah was aggrieved because the Uzzielites had been preferred in the person of Elizaphan to the Izharites (chapter 3:30). These accusations have nothing whatever in the narrative to support them, and are suspicious because they are so easy and so sure to be made in such cases. In all <span class="accented">ecclesiastical</span> history the true reformer, as well as the heretic and the demagogue, has always been charged with being actuated by motives of disappointed ambition. Without these gratuitous suppositions there was quite enough to excite the anger and opposition of such discontented and insubordinate minds as are to be found in every community. <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">certain of the children of Israel.</span> These were gathered front the tribes at large, as implied in the statement that Zelophehad a Manassite was not amongst them (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Famous in the congregation.</span> Literally, "called men of the congregation."

At the same time, the attack of Korah and his company (with whom alone the narrative is really concerned here) was directed especially against the ecclesiastical rule which Moses exercised through his brother Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">take too much upon you.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "much for you," probably in the sense of "enough for you" (cf. the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, you have enjoyed power long enough; so the Targum Palestine. It may, however, be taken with the following <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as meaning, "let it suffice you that all the congregation," &c.; and so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> The Targum of Onkelos renders it in the same sense as the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation are holy, every one of them.</span> This was perfectly true, m a sense. There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation of the Lord.</span> There are two words for congregation in this verse: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors.

It may well be that his position as a prominent Levite and a relation of Moses gave him great influence with men of other tribes, and earned him a great name for disinterestedness and liberality in advocating the rights of all Israel, and in denouncing the exclusive claims and privileges by which he himself (as a Levite) was benefited. It is often assumed that Korah was secretly aiming at the high-priesthood, but of this, again, there is not a shadow of proof; his error was great enough, and his punishment sore enough, without casting upon him these unfounded accusations. It would be more in accordance with human nature if we supposed that Korah was in his way sincere; that he had really convinced himself, by dint of trying to convince others, that Moses and Aaron were usurpers; that he began his agitation without thought of advantage of himself; that, having gained a considerable following and much popular applause, the pride of leadership and the excitement of conflict led him on to the last extremity. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> will <span class="cmt_word">show who are his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, the meaning of which is defined by the following words, "whom he hath chosen." Moses refers the matter to the direct decision of the Lord; as that decision had originated the separate position of Aaron, that should also vindicate it.

From the number required, they must have been either household utensils used for carrying fire, or else they must have been made in some simple fashion for the occasion. The offering of incense was proposed by Moses as a test because it was a typically priestly function, to which the gravest importance was attached (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>), and because it was so very simply executed.

They were seeking the priesthood because they affirmed it to be the common possession of all Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Against the Lord.</span> It was in his name that they appeared, and to some extent no doubt sincerely; but since they appeared to dispute an ordinance actually and historically made by God himself, it was indeed against him that they were gathered. <span class="cmt_word">And what is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Aaron,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ye murmur against him?</span> The construction is broken, as so often when we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of Moses, whose meekness did not enable him to speak calmly under provocation. The sentence runs, "For which cause thou and all thy company who arc gathered against the Lord, - and Aaron, who is he, that ye murmur against him?"

In this case, however, the event was predicted, and wholly supernatural. The sequence of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the earth opened beneath the tents of Dathan and Abiram in the camp of Reuben. It is difficult to think of the gulf as extending so far as to involve the tent of Korah in the Kohathite lines in the same destruction, while there is nothing to suggest the idea that the earth opened in more than one place. It is true that the camps of the Reubenites and of the Kohathites were more or less contiguous; but when it is remembered that there were 46,500 adult males in the former, and 8600 males in the latter, and that a broad space must have been left between the two lines of encampment, it is obviously improbable that Korah's tent was in a practical sense "near" to those of Dathan and Abiram, unless indeed he had purposely removed it in order to be under the protection of his Reubenite partisans. It is very observable that not a word is said here as to the fate of Korah himself. It is implied in verse 40 that he had perished, and it is apparently asserted in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a> that he was swallowed up with Dathan and Abiram (see the note there). On the other hand, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-17.htm">Psalm 106:17</a> speak of the engulfing of the other two without any mention of Korah himself sharing their fate; and while "all the men that appertained unto Korah" perished, his own sons did not (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>). On these grounds it is held by most commentators that Korah died by fire among those who offered incense (verse 35). This, however, is untenable, because "the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense" are distinctly mentioned as having been his partisans (verse 2), and are always counted exclusive of Korah himself. On the whole, while it is certain that the narrative is very obscure, and the question very doubtful, it seems most agreeable to all the testimonies of Holy Scripture to conclude - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Korah had left his own place, and had some sort of dwelling (mischan) either in common with Dathan and Abiram, or hard by their tents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the earth opened and swallowed up the <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, of Korah, and the tents of Dathan and Abiram. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That Korah's men (see next verse) and their property were swallowed up with his <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, and (as far as we can tell) Korah himself also.

Thus the "rod of an almond-tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>) was shown to the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>) as the evident symbol of the vigilant haste with which the purposes of God were to be developed and matured. It is possible that all the tribe princes had official "rods" of the almond-tree to denote their watchful alacrity in duty, and that these were the rods which they brought to Moses. In any case the flowering and fruiting of Aaron's rod, while it was an unquestionable miracle (for if not a miracle, it could only have been a disgraceful imposture), was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in the true sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a miracle which was also a parable. Aaron's rod could no more blossom and fruit by nature than any of the others, since it also had been severed from the living tree; and so in Aaron himself was no more power or goodness than in the rest of Israel. But as the rod germinated and matured its fruit by the power of God, supernaturally starting and accelerating the natural forces of vegetable life, even so in Aaron the grace of God was quick and fruitful to put forth, not the signs only and promise of spiritual gifts and energies, but the ripened fruits as well.

As a fact, however, it does not appear that the lesson ever needed to be learnt again, and therefore we may suppose that the rod was left first to shrivel with age, and then to be lost through some accident.

This change in the form of the message may point to a later date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to a time subsequent to the gainsaying of Korah, when the separate position of Aaron as the head of a priestly caste was more fully recognized than before, and he himself somewhat less under the shadow of his greater brother. <span class="cmt_word">Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the sanctuary.</span> Aaron's father's house, according to the analogy of <a href="../../par/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2, 3, 6</a>, was the sub-tribe of the Kohathites, and these had charge (to the exclusion of the other Levites) of the sanctuary, or rather sacred things (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). See on Numbers 4:15. This mention of the Kohathites in connection with the sanctuary is an incidental proof that these instructions were given in view of the wanderings in the wilderness, for after the settlement in Canaan no Levites (as such) came into contact with the sacred furniture. It is not easy to define exactly the meaning of "shall bear the iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of the sanctuary." The general sense of the phrase is, "to be responsible for the iniquity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for anything which caused displeasure in the eyes of God, "in connection with the sacred things and the service of them;" hence it meant either to be responsible for such iniquity, as being held accountable for it, and having to endure the penalty, or as being permitted and enabled to take such accountability on oneself, and so discharge it from others. This double sense is exactly reflected in the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as applied to our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The priests, therefore (and the Kohathites, so far as they had anything to do with the sanctuary), were responsible for all the unholiness attaching or accruing to it, not only by reason of all offences committed by themselves, but by reason of that imperfection which clung to them at the best, and made them unworthy to handle the things of God. In a further and deeper sense they might be said to be vicariously responsible for all the iniquity of all Israel, so far as the taint of it affected the very sanctuary (see on Exodus 28:38; Leviticus 16:16). <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of your priesthood.</span> The responsibility not only for all sinful acts of omission and commission in Divine service (such as those of Nadab and Abihu, and of Korah), but for all the inevitable failure of personal holiness on the part of those who ministered unto the Lord. This responsibility was emphatically recognized and provided for in the rites of the great day of atonement.

It would seem that the priest was to make the valuation for the people, since each first-born or firstling was separately claimed by God, and had to be separately redeemed; but at the same time, to prevent extortion, the sum which the priest might assess was fixed by God. <span class="cmt_word">For the money of five shekels.</span> About seventeen shillings of our money (see <a href="../../par/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>).

The spiritual meaning of the promise was so clearly felt that it was constantly claimed by the devout in Israel, irrespective of their ecclesiastical status (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-24.htm">Lamentations 3:24</a>, &c.).

At this time the other Israelites were nearly fifty times as numerous as the Levites, and therefore they would have been exceptionally well provided for. It must be remembered, however, that the Levites would naturally increase faster than the rest, not being exposed to the same dangers; and still more that tithes are never paid at all fully or generally, even when of strict legal obligation. A glance along the history of Israel after the conquest will satisfy us that at no time could the people at large be trusted to pay their tithes, unless it were during the ascendancy of the Maccabees, and afterwards under the influence of the Pharisees (cf. <a href="../../par/malachi/3-9.htm">Malachi 3:9, 10</a>). The Levites, indeed, appear in the history of Israel as the reverse of an opulent or influential class. It was no doubt much easier for the sons of Aaron to obtain their tithes from the Levites; and as these were very numerous in proportion, and the tithes themselves were only a part of their revenues, the priests should have been, and in later times certainly were, sufficiently rich. If they were devout they no doubt spent much on the service of the altar and of the sanctuary.

There is no note of time in connection with this chapter, but internal evidence points strongly to the supposition that it belongs to the early days of wandering after the ban. It belongs to a period when death had resumed his normal, and more than his normal, power over the children of Israel; when, having been for a short time expelled (except in a limited number of cases - see above on Numbers 10:28), he had come back with frightful rigour to reign over a doomed generation. It belongs also, as it would seem, to a time when the daily, monthly, and even annual routine of sacrifice and purgation was suspended through poverty, distress, and disfavour with God. It tells of the mercy and condescension which did not leave even the rebellious and excommunicate without some simple remedy, some easily-obtainable solace, for the one religious distress which must of necessity press upon them daily and hourly, not only as Israelites, but as children of the East, sharing the ordinary superstitions of the age. Through the valley of the shadow of death they were doomed at Kadesh to walk, while their fellows fell beside them one by one, until the reek and taint of death passed upon the whole congregation. Almost all nations have had, as is well known, an instinctive horror of death, which has every. where demanded separation and purification on the part of those who have come in contact with it (Bahr, 'Symbolik,' 2, page 466 <span class="accented">sq.</span>). And this religious horror had not been combated, but, on the contrary, fostered and deepened by the Mosaic legislation. The law everywhere encouraged the idea that sin and death were essentially connected, and that  disease and death spread their infection in the spiritual as well as in the natural order of things. Life and death were the two opposite poles under the law, as under the gospel; but the eye of faith was fixed upon natural life and natural death, and was not trained to look beyond. It could never have occurred to a Jew to say, <span class="accented">"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."</span> To die, however nobly, was not only to be cut off from God oneself, but to become a curse and a danger and a cause of religious defilement to those around. There is, therefore, a beautiful consistency between this enactment and the circumstances of the time on the one hand, between this enactment and the revealed character of God on the other hand. Although they were his covenant people no more, since they were under sentence of death, yet, like others, and more than others, they had religious horrors and religious fears - not very spiritual, perhaps, but very real to them; these horrors and fears cried to him piteously for relief, and that relief he was careful to give. They must die, but they need not suffer daily torment of death; they must not worship him in the splendid and perfect order of his appointed ritual, but they should at least have the rites which should make life tolerable to them. It appears to be a mistake to connect this ordinance especially with the plague which occurred after the rebellion of Korah. It was not an exceptional calamity, the effects of which might indeed be widespread, but would be soon over, which the people had to dread exceedingly; it was the daily mortality always going on in every camp under all circumstances. If only the elder generation died off in the wilderness, this alone would yield nearly 100 victims every day, and by each of these a considerable number of the survivors must have been defiled. Thus, in the absence of special provision, one of two things must have happened: either the unhappy people would have grown callous and indifferent to the awful presence of death; or, more probably, a dark cloud of religious horror and depression would have permanently enveloped them.

Law-statute: an unusual combination only found elsewhere in <a href="../../par/numbers/31-21.htm">Numbers 31:21</a>, which also concerns legal purifications. <span class="cmt_word">A red heifer.</span> This offering was obviously intended, apart from its symbolic significance, to be studiedly simple and cheap. In contradiction to the many and costly and ever-repeated sacrifices of the Sinaitic legislation, this was a single individual, a female, and of the most common description: red is the most ordinary colour of cattle, and a young heifer is of less value than any other beast of its kind. The ingenuity indeed of the Jews heaped around the choice of this animal a multitude of precise requirements, and supplemented the prescribed ritual with many ceremonies, some of which are incorporated by the Targums with the sacred text; but even so they could not destroy the remarkable contrast between the simplicity of this offering and the elaborate complexity of those ordained at Sinai. Only six red heifers are said to have been needed during the whole of Jewish history, so far-reaching and so long-enduring were the uses and advantages of a single immolation. It is evident that this ordinance had for its distinguishing character oneness as opposed to multiplicity, simplicity contrasted with elaborateness. <span class="cmt_word">Without spot, wherein is no blemish.</span> See on Leviticus 4:8. However little, comparatively speaking, the victim might cost them, it must yet be perfect of its kind. The later Jews held that three white hairs together on any part of the body made it unfit for the purpose. On the sex and color of the offering see below. <span class="cmt_word">Upon which never came yoke.</span> Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>. The imposition of the yoke, according to the common sentiment of all nations, was a species of degradation, and therefore inconsistent with the ideal of what was fit to be offered in rids ease. That the matter was wholly one of sentiment is nothing to the point: God doth not care for oxen of any kind, but he doth care that man should give him what is, whether in fact or in fancy, the best of its sort. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/19-3.htm">Numbers 19:3</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and <i>one</i> shall slay her before his face:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Eleazar the priest.</span> Possibly in order that Aaron himself might not be associated with dearly, even in this indirect way (see verse 6). In after times, however, it was usually the high priest who officiated on this occasion, and therefore it is quite as likely that Eleazar was designated because he was already beginning to take the place of his father in his especial duties. <span class="cmt_word">Without the camp.</span> The bodies of those animals which were offered for the sin of the congregation were always burnt outside the camp, the law thus testifying that sin and death had no proper place within the city of God. In this case, however, the whole sacrifice was performed outside the camp, and was only brought into relation with the national sanctuary by the sprinkling of the blood in that direction. Various symbolic reasons have been assigned to this fact, but none are satisfactory except the following: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It served to intensify the conviction, which the whole of this ordinance was intended to bring home to the minds of men, that death was an awful thing, and that everything connected with it was wholly foreign to the presence and habitation of the living God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It served to mark with more emphasis the contrast between this one offering, which  was perhaps almost the only one they had in the wilderness, and those which ought to have been offered continually according to the Levitical ordinances. The red heifer stood quite outside the number of ordinary victims as demanded by the law, and therefore it was not slain at any hallowed altar, nor, necessarily, by any hallowed hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It served to prefigure in a wonderful and indeed startling way the sacrifice of Christ outside the gate. In later days the heifer was conducted upon a double tier of arches over the ravine of Kedron to the opposite slope of Olivet. <span class="cmt_word">That he may bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">her forth...  and one shall slay her.</span> The nominative to both these verbs is alike unexpressed.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/19-4.htm">Numbers 19:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And Eleazar...  shall...  sprinkle</span> <span class="cmt_word">of her blood directly before</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the tabernacle.</span> By this act the death of the heifer became a sacrificial offering. The sprinkling in the direction of the sanctuary intimated that the offering was made to him that dwelt therein, and the "seven times" was the ordinary number of perfect perform<span class="accented">ance</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-17.htm">Leviticus 4:17</a>, &c.).

This great truth, which underlay all animal sacrifices, was represented in this case by the sprinkling towards the sanctuary. The rest of the blood was burnt with the carcass, either because outside the holy precincts there was no consecrated earth to receive the blood, or in order that the virtue of the blood might in a figure pass into the ashes and add to their efficacy.

The antiseptic and medicinal qualities of the cedar (<span class="accented">Juniperus oxycedrus</span>) and hyssop (probably <span class="accented">Capparis spinosa</span>) make their use readily intelligible; the symbolism of the "scarlet" is much more obscure.

Every one of these details was devised in order to express the intensely infectious character of death in its moral aspect. The very ashes, which were so widely potent for cleansing (verse 10), and the cleansing water itself (verse 19), made every one that touched them, even for the purifying of another, himself unclean. At the same time the ashes, while, as it were, so redolent of death that they must be kept outside the camp, were most holy, and were to be laid up by a clean man in a clean place (verse 9).

It may, of course, be said that he had other sons not enumerated, but such an assumption is arbitrary and improbable in the face of the family genealogies in chapter 26. If he had any other sons, they did not leave any families behind them. But if the sojourning of the Israelites in Egypt was 430 years, according to the plain statement of <a href="../../par/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>, even this increase is quite within possible, and even probable, limits, considering the peculiar circumstances and the known fecundity of the race. For if Hushim, who came into Egypt with his grandfather, had only three sons born to him within the next twenty-five years, and if his descendants doubled themselves every quarter of a century, which is not an uncommon rate of increase under certain circumstances, then his numbers would have fully reached 200,000 by the time of the exodus. Perhaps the most puzzling feature about the increase is the great inequality with which it was spread over the various tribes, a fact of which we cannot even suggest any explanation.

The latter words are emphatic here and in verse 22, and seem intended to mark the period of reassembly after the dispersion of nearly thirty eight years. Probably a portion of the tribes had visited Kadesh many times during those years, and perhaps it had never been wholly abandoned. <span class="cmt_word">Into  the desert of Zin,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if the western site be maintained for Kadesh, the Wady Murreh.

It can scarcely, however, be doubted that her death in the unlovely wilderness was a punishment like the death of her brothers. There is no reason whatever to suppose that she had any part in the rebellion of Kadesh, or that the sentence of death there pronounced included her; she was indeed at this time advanced in years, rut that would not in itself account for the fact that she died in exile; it is, no doubt, to the arrogance and rebellion recorded in chapter 12 that we must look for the true explanation of her untimely end.

At this time, however, the bulk of the encampment may have lain in a different direction (cf. verse 1 with chapter Numbers 13:26), or the supply may have failed kern temporary causes.

On the other hand, the daily mortality which had carried off their brethren is clearly excluded by the phrase, "before the Lord." It may he that the rebellion of Korah happened towards <span class="cmt_word">the</span> end of the period of wandering, and that the reference is to the plague which followed it; or it may be that the formula of complaint had become stereotyped, as those of children often do, and was employed from time <span class="cmt_word">to</span> time without variation and without definite reference.

It has been rendered by some "Can we fetch you water," on the supposition that Moses really doubted the possibility of such a miracle, but this seems to be an entire mistake (see next note).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of</span> Israel. It is very important, and at the same time very difficult, to understand what the precise sin of Moses and Aaron was upon this occasion. That it was very serious is manifest from the punishment which is entailed. Aaron, indeed, does not appear in the narrative, save in his usual subordinate position as associated with his brother by the Divine mandate. It has been said that he might have checked the unadvised words of Moses, but that is wholly beside the mark. Aaron had obviously no control whatever over his far more able and energetic brother, and therefore could have no responsibility in that respect. We can only suppose that he inwardly assented to the language and conduct with which he was outwardly associated, and therefore shared the guilt. A less degree of sin was (so to speak) necessary in his cause, because he had on former occasions so greatly dishonoured his office; and the anger of God against the sin of his ministers, although laid to sleep, is ever ready to awake upon the recurrence <span class="cmt_word">of</span> a similar provocation. We may therefore dismiss him, and consider only the case of Moses. It is impossible to suppose that Moses actually doubted the power of God to supply the present need, for he held in his hand the very rod with which he had struck the rock in Rephidim, nor is there anything in his words or acts upon this occasion to imply any such disbelief. The language of <a href="../../par/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21, 22</a> may be cited on the other side, but that was spoken in passion, and spoken to God, and cannot be held as expressing an actual failure of faith. Nor do subsequent references point to unbelief as having been the sin of Moses (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>). Rather, they point to disobedience and indiscretion; to such disloyal conduct and language as produced a bad impression upon the people, and did not place the Divine character before them in its true light. We must understand, therefore, that the want of belief with which Moses stood charged was not a want of faith in the power of God, but a want of obedience to the will of God, bearing in mind that the two faults of disbelief and disobedience are but two sides of one inward fact, and are perpetually confounded in the language of Scripture (compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament). What then was the disobedience of Moses? Here, again, the more obvious answer is insufficient. It is true that Moses struck the rock twice instead of (or perhaps in addition to) speaking to it; but God had bid him take the rod, and he might naturally think he was meant to use it as before; moreover, the people could not have known anything of the exact terms of the command, and would have thought no more of his striking the rock at Kadesh than at Rephidim; but it was the fact of the bad impression made upon the people which was the ground of the Divine rebuke. We come back, therefore, to the simple conclusion expressed by the Psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32, 33</a>), that Moses lost his temper, and in the irritation of the moment spoke and acted in such a way and in such a spirit as to dishonour his Master and to impair the good effect of the Divine beneficence. It is quite likely that the repeated striking of the rock was one sign of the anger to which Moses gave way, but we could hardly have attached any serious character to the act if it had stood alone. It is in the words of Moses, words in which he associated Aaron with himself, that we must find the explanation of the displeasure he incurred. That he called the people "rebels" was unseemly, not because it was untrue, or because it was an uncalled-for term of reproach, but because he himself was at that very moment a rebel, and disloyal in heart to his Master (cf. verse 24). That he should say, "Must we fetch you water out of this rock?" showed how completely he was carried away. It is true that God had said to him, "Thou shalt bring forth to them water," and, "Thou shalt give the congregation...  drink" (compare this with <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), and it is probable that his own words were more or less consciously dictated by this remembrance; but he knew very well that the Divine mandate afforded him no real justification; that he and Aaron were the merest instruments in the hand of God; that it was peculiarly necessary to keep this fact before the minds of the people; nevertheless, his vexation and anger betrayed him into putting himself - a mere man, and a man too in a very bad temper - into the place of God before the eyes of the whole congregation. Moses had fallen at least once before (see on Numbers 11:11-15) into a similar error, one so natural to an angry mind; but this was the first time that he had made his error public, and thereby dishonoured the Master whom it was his special duty to uphold and glorify. This was the sin, and if the punishment seem disproportionate, it must be remembered that the heinousness of a sin depends quite as much on the position of the sinner as upon its intrinsic enormity. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not bring this</span>  <span class="cmt_word">congregation into the land.</span> That they should die in the wilderness was implied in this sentence, but was not strictly a part of the sentence itself. Moses, indeed, although he did not enter the land of promise in its narrower sense, yet he died within the inheritance of Israel. Since they had behaved unworthily of their high office as leaders of the people, therefore that office should be taken from them before the glorious end. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the water of Meribah,</span> or "water of strife."

A similar use of the word is recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>. That the same name was more or less definitely attached to these two scenes is only another way of saying that there was a strong similarity between the two sets of associations. At the same time the differences are so marked in the narratives that they leave very distinct impressions upon the mind. <span class="cmt_word">And he was sanctified in them,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he revealed there his holiness and power, and put to silence their evil murmurings against him. He was sanctified in them all the more abundantly because Moses and Aaron failed to sanctify him in the eyes of the people; but what they failed to do he brought to pass without their agency.

It would seem probable from <a href="../../par/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a> that the government was at that time (forty years before the present date) still in the hands of "dukes," and that the change had but recently taken place. It is stated in <a href="../../par/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a> that Moses sent messengers at this time with a like request to the king of Moab. We are not indeed obliged to suppose that Jephthah, living 300 years after, stated the facts correctly; but there is no particular reason to doubt it in this case. That no mention of it is made here would be sufficiently explained by the fact that the refusal of Edom made the answer of Moab of no practical moment. That Moses asked a passage through the territory of Edom implies that he had renounced the idea of invading Canaan from the south. This was not on account of any insuperable difficulties presented by the character of the country or of its inhabitants, for such did not exist; nor on account of any supposed presence of Egyptian troops in the south of Palestine: but simply on account of the fact that Israel had deliberately refused to take the straight road into their land, and were therefore condemned to follow a long and circuitous route ere they reached it on an altogether different side. The dangers and difficulties of the road they actually traversed were, humanly speaking, far greater than any they would have encountered in any other direction; but this was part of their necessary discipline. <span class="cmt_word">Thy brother Israel.</span> This phrase recalled the history of Esau and Jacob, and of the brotherly kindness which the former had shown to the latter at a time when he had him in his power (<a href="../../par/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">knowest all the travel that hath befallen us.</span> Moses assumed that Edom would take a fraternal interest in the fortunes of Israel. The parallel was singularly close between the position of Jacob when he met with Esau, and the present position of Israel; we may well suppose that Moses intended to make this felt without directly asserting it.

If the narrative follows the order of time, we must suppose that the Edomites at once blocked the passes near to Kadesh, and thus compelled the Israelites to journey southwards for some distance until they were clear of the Azazimat; they would then turn eastwards again and make their way across the plateau of Paran to the Arabah at a point <span class="accented">opposite</span> Mount Hen It is supposed by many, although it finds no support in the narrative itself, that the armed resistance offered by Edom is out of chronological order in verse 20, and only occurred in fact when the Israelites had reached the neighbourhood of Mount Her, and were preparing to ascend the Wady Ghuweir. On the name of Mount Her (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) see on Numbers 34:7, 8. There can be no doubt that tradition is right in identifying it with the Jebel Harun (mount of Aaron), a lofty and precipitous mountain rising between the Arabah and the site of Petra. On one of its two summits the tomb of Aaron is still shown, and although this is itself worthless as evidence, yet the character and position of the mountain are altogether in agreement with the legend.

It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a>), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The "king of Arad, is mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>, and "the Negeb of Arad" in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah. According to Eusebius, it stood twenty Roman miles to the south of Hebron, and its site has been found by modern travelers at Tel-Arad, a low hill in this direction. On the Negeb see note on Numbers 13:17. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the spies.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

The translation is very uncertain; <span class="accented">atharim</span> may be a proper name, as the Septuagint seems to suppose, or it may be an unusual  plural formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "spies," as the Chaldee, Samaritan, and most of the versions take it; or it may be simply the plural from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a place, used with some local meaning which made it practically a proper name. If the rendering of the A.V. be correct, "the way of the spies" must have been the route by which they ascended to Hebron through the Negeb (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17, 22</a>), and the king of Arid must have anticipated an invasion in that direction, and sought to forestall it. <span class="cmt_word">And took some of them prisoners.</span> This would seem to show that he fell upon them unawares, and cut off some detached parties. Nothing is said of any disobedience on the part of Israel to account for defeat in battle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel vowed a vow.</span> On these vows, and on things "devoted" or "banned" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), see on Leviticus 27:28, and on the moral character of such wholesale slaughters see on chapter 31. If it was right to destroy the Canaanites at all, no fault can be found with the vow; it merely did for that military proceeding what national feeling and discipline does for the far more bloody exigencies of modern warfare, removing it from the sphere of private hatred, revenge, and cupidity, and placing it upon a higher level. The patriot soldier of these days feels himself to be a mere instrument in the hands of the rulers of his people to maintain their rights or avenge their wrongs. The Israelite could not have this feeling, which was foreign to his time and place in history, but he could feel that he was a mere instrument in the hands of God to perform <span class="accented">his</span> will upon <span class="accented">his</span> enemies. In either case a must important advantage is secured; the soldier does not slay in order to gratify his own hatred, or in order to satisfy his own cupidity. It is quite true that such vows as are here mentioned would certainly in a more advanced stage of civilization be abused to throw a cloak of religion over frightful enormities; but it does not in the least follow that they were not permitted and even encouraged by God in an age to which they were natural, and under circumstances in which they were beneficial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They utterly destroyed them and their cities.</span> Rather, "they banned (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) them and their cities." No doubt the banning implies here their utter destruction, because it is not the vow before the battle, but the carrying of it out after the victory, which is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And he called the name of the place Hormah.</span> Rather, "the name of the place was called (impersonal use of the transitive) Charmah." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It is not very clear what place received this name at this time. It does not appear to have been Arid itself, as would have seemed most natural, because Arid and Hormah are mentioned side by side in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>. It is identified with Zephath in <a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>. It may have been the place where the victory was won which gave all the cities of Arid to destruction. Whether it was the Hormah mentioned in chapter Numbers 14:45 is very doubtful (see note there). The nomenclature of the Jews, especially as to places, and most especially as to places with which their own connection was passing or broken, was vague and confused in the extreme, and nothing can be more unsatisfactory than arguments which turn upon the shifting names of places long ago perished and forgotten. It must be added that the three verses which narrate the chastisement of this Canaanite chieftain have caused immense embarrassment to commentators. If the incident is narrated in its proper order of time, it must have happened during the stay of the Israelites under Mount Hor, when they had finally left the neighbourhood of the Negeb, and were separated from the king of Arid by many days' march, and by a most impracticable country. It is therefore generally supposed that the narrative is out of place, and that it really belongs to the time when Israel was gathered together for the second time at Kadesh, and When his reappearance there in force might well have given rise to the report that be was about to invade Canaan from that side. This is unsatisfactory, because no plausible reason can be assigned for the insertion of the notice where it stands, both here and in <a href="../../par/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>. To say that Moses wished to bring it into juxtaposition with the victories recorded in the latter part of the chapter, from which it is separated by the incident of the fiery serpents, and the brief record of many journeys, is to confess that no explanation can be invented which has the least show of reason. If the narrative be displaced, the displacement must simply be due to accident or interpolation. Again, it would seem quite inconsistent with the position and plans of Israel since the rebellion of Kadesh that any invasion and conquest, even temporary, of any part of Canaan should be made at this time, and that especially if the attack was not made until Israel was lying in the Arabah on his way round the land of Edom. It is therefore supposed by some that the vow only was made at this time, and the ban suspended over the place, and that it was only carried out as part of the general conquest under Joshua; that, in fact, the fulfillment of the vow is narrated in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16, 17</a>. This, however, throws the narrative as it stands into confusion and discredit, for the ban and the destruction become a mockery and an unreality if nothing more was done to  the towns of the king of Arad than was done at the same time to the towns of all his neighbours. It would be more reverent to reject the story as an error or a falsehood than to empty it of the meaning which it was obviously intended to convey. We are certainly meant to understand that the vow was there and then accepted by God, and was there and then carried into effect by Israel; the towns of Arad were depopulated and destroyed as far as lay in their power, although they may have been immediately reoccupied. There are only two theories which are worth considering. 1. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> really be displaced, for what cause we do not know. If so, it would <span class="accented">he</span> more satisfactory to refer it, not to the time of the second encampment at Kadesh, but to the time of the first, during the absence of the spies in Canaan. It is probable that their entry was known, as was the case with Joshua's spies (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>); and nothing could be more likely than that the king of Arad, suspecting what would follow, should attempt to anticipate invasion by attack. If it were so it might help to account for the rash confidence shown by the people afterwards (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40</a>), for the mention of Hormah (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and for the reappearance of kings of Hormah and of Arad in the days of <a href="../../par/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> after all be in place. That the Israelites lay for thirty days under Mount Hor is certain, and they may have been longer. During this period they could not get pasture for their cattle on the side of Edom, and they may have wandered far and wide in search of it. It may have been but a comparatively small band which approached the Negeb near enough to be attacked, and which, by the help of God, was enabled to defeat the king of Arad, and to lay waste his towns. It had certainly been no great feat for all Israel to overthrow a border chieftain who could not possibly have brought 5000 men into the field. CHAPTERS 21:4-9 THE FIERY SERPENTS (verses 4-9).

The word <span class="accented">saraph</span> which seems to mean "burning one," stands (by itself) for a serpent in verse 8, and also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 6</a> it stands for one of the symbolic beings (seraphim) of the prophet's vision. The only idea common to the two meanings (otherwise so distinct) must be that of brilliance and metallic luster. It is commonly assumed that the "fiery" serpents were so called because of the burning pain and inflammation caused by the bite, after the analogy of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of Dioscorus and AElian. But is hardly possible that Isaiah should have used the same word in such wholly dissimilar senses, and it is clear from comparison with Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>) that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> of <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> was so called from the burnished luster of his appearance. Even our Lord himself is described in the Apocalypse as having in the highest degree this appearance of glowing brass (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>). It is further clear that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> was so named from his colour, not his venom, because when Moses was ordered to make a <span class="accented">saraph</span> he made a serpent of brass (or rather copper), with the evident intent of imitating as closely as possible the appearance of the venomous  reptile. We may conclude then with some confidence that these serpents were of a fiery red colour, resembling in this respect certain very deadly snakes in Australia, which are known as "copper snakes." Travelers speak of some such pests as still abounding in the region of the Arabah, but it is quite uncertain whether the fiery serpents of that special visitation can be identified with any existing species.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel set forward</span>, and pitched in Oboth. In the list of chapter 33, there occur two other stations, Zahnonah and Phunon, between Mount Hor and Oboth. Phunon may be the Pinou of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-41.htm">Genesis 36:41</a>, but it is a mere conjecture. All we can conclude with any certainty is that the Israelites passed round the southern end of the mountains of Edom by the Wady el Ithm, and then marched northwards along the eastern border of Edom by the route now followed between Mekba and Damascus. On this side the mountains are far less precipitous and defensible than on  the other, and this circumstance must have abated the insolence of the Edomites. Moreover, they must now have seen enough of Israel to know that, while immensely formidable in number and discipline, he had no hostile designs against them. It is therefore not surprising to find from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a> that on this side the mountaineers supplied Israel with bread and water, just as they supply the pilgrim caravans at the present day. That they exacted payment for what they supplied was perfectly reasonable: no one could expect a poor people to feed a nation of two million souls, however nearly related, for nothing. Oboth has been identified with the modern halting-place of el-Ahsa, on the pilgrim route above mentioned, on the ground of supposed similarity in the meaning of the names; but the true rendering of Oboth is doubtful (see on Leviticus 19:31), and, apart from that, any such similarity of meaning is too vague and slight a ground for any argument to be built upon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-11.htm">Numbers 21:11</a></div><div class="verse">And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which <i>is</i> before Moab, toward the sunrising.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And pitched at Ije-abarim.</span> Ije (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>), or Ijm (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), as it is called in chapter Numbers 33:45, signifies "heaps" or "ruins." Abarim is a word of somewhat doubtful meaning, best rendered "ridges" or "ranges." It was apparently applied to the whole of Peraea in later times (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20</a>, "passages"), but in the Pentateuch is confined elsewhere to the ranges facing Jericho. These "ruinous heaps of the ranges" lay to the east of Moab, along the desert side of which Israel was now marching, still going northwards: they cannot-be identified.

It must have been in the upper part of its course, in the desert uplands, that the Israelites crossed it; and this both because the passage lower down is extremely difficult, and also because they were keeping well to the eastward of Moabitish territory up to this point. It is not certain which side of the stream is intended by "the other side," because the force of these expressions depends as often upon the point of view of the writer as of the reader. It would appear from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a> that Israel remained at this spot until the embassage to Sihon had returned. <span class="cmt_word">That cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Aruon, or perhaps one of its confluents which comes down from the northeast. <span class="cmt_word">For Arnon is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the border of</span> Moab.

If it should seem strange that a book of this description should be already in existence, we must remember that amongst the multitude of Israel there must in the nature of things have been some "poets" in the then acceptation of the word. Some songs there must have been, and those songs would be mainly inspired by the excitement and triumph of the final marches. The first flush of a new national life achieving its first victories over the national foe always finds expression in songs and odes. It is abundantly evident from the foregoing narrative that writing of some sort was in common use at least among the leaders of Israel (see on Numbers 11:26), and they would not have thought it beneath them to collect these spontaneous effusions of a nation just awaking to the poetry of its own existence. The archaic character of the fragments preserved in this chapter, which makes them sound so foreign to our ears, is a strong testimony to their genuineness. It is hardly credible that any one of a later generation should have cared either to compose or to quote snatches of song which, like dried flowers, have lost everything but scientific value in being detached from the soil which gave them birth. <span class="cmt_word">What he did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon.</span> Rather, "Vaheb in whirlwind, and the brooks of Arnon."

The peculiarity of the site, "in the midst of the river" (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), and extensive ruins, have enabled travelers to identify the spot on which it stood at the junction of the Mojeb (Arnon) and Lejum (Nahaliel, verse 19). It is uncertain whether the Greeks gave the name of Areopolis, as Jerome asserts, to Ar,  but in later times it was Rabbah, a town many miles further south in the heart of Moab which bore this name. Ar was at this period the boundary town of Moab, and as such was respected by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9, 29</a>).

The original runs simply thus: "And from Bamoth - the valley which in the field - Moab - the top - Pisgah."

Pisgah ("the ridge") was a part of the Abarim ranges west of Heshbon, from the summit of which the first view is gained of the valley of Jordan and the hills of Palestine (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which looketh toward Jeshimon.</span> Jeshimon, or "the waste," seems to mean here that desert plain on the north-east side of the Salt Sea now called the Ghor el Belka, which included in its barren desolation the southernmost portion of the Jordan valley.

The list of stations in the preceding verses may probably have been copied out of some official record; it may be considered as marking the movements of the tabernacle with Eleazar and the Levites and the mass of the non-combatant population. In the mean time the armies of Israel were engaged in victorious enterprises which took them far afield. <span class="cmt_word">King of the Amorites.</span> The Amorites were not akin to the Hebrews, as the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites were, who all claimed descent from Terah. They were of the Canaanitish stock (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>), and indeed the name Amorite often appears as synonymous with Canaanite in its larger sense (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 27</a>, &c.). If at one time they are mentioned side by side with five or six other tribes of the same stock (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11</a>), yet at another they seem to be so much the representative race that "the Ammorite" stands for the inhabitants of Canaan in general whom Israel was commissioned to oust on account of his iniquity (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). It is not, therefore, possible to draw any certain distinction between the Amorites of Sihon's kingdom and the mass of the Canaanites on the other side Jordan. Both Sihon and his people appear as intruders in this region, having come down perhaps from the northern parts of Palestine, and having but recently (it would seem) wrested from the king of Moab all his territory north of Arnon. It was the fact of the Amorites being found here which led to the conquest and settlement of the trans-Jordanic territory. That territory was not apparently included in the original gift (compare <a href="../../par/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a> with <a href="../../par/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and Genesis 15:19-21), but since the Amorite had possessed himself of it, it must pass with all the rest of his habitation to the chosen people.

It was, therefore, a critical moment in their history when they met the forces of Sihon, confident from their recent victory over Moab. We may suppose that Joshua was their military leader now, as before and after. From Arnon unto Jabbok. The Jabbok, which formed the boundary of Sihon on the north towards the kingdom of Og, and on the east towards the Ammonites, is the modern Zerka: it runs in a large curve northeast, north-west, and west, until it fails into Jordan, forty-five miles north of the mouth of the Arnon. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> This is perhaps intended to explain rather why the Amorites had not extended their conquests any further, than why the Israelites made no attempt to cross the border of Ammon; they had another and more sufficient reason (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Rabbah of Ammon, which stood upon the right (here the eastern) bank of the Upper Jabbok, was an extremely strong place which effectually protected the country behind it, even until the reign of David (see on 2 Samuel 11, 12).

Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (<a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>) in form, and either male or female (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> in <a href="../../par/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god "Ashtar-Chemosh" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side. Human sacrifices were offered to him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26, 27</a>), as to Baal and to Moloch. He hath given his sons, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Chemosh, who could not save his own votaries, nor the children of his people.

Bashan itself comprised the plain now known as Jaulan and Haulan beyond the Jarmuk (now Mandhur), the largest affluent of the Jordan, which joins it a few miles below the lake of Tiberias.

The cities of Og were so strong that the Israelites could not have dispossessed him by any might of their own if he had abode behind his walls.

That this section of the Book of Numbers has a character to a great extent peculiar and isolated is evident upon the face of it. The arguments indeed derived from its language and style to prove that it is by a different hand from the rest of the Book are obviously too slight and doubtful to <span class="accented">be</span> of any weight; there does not seem to be any more diversity in this respect than the difference of subject matter would lead us to expect. The peculiarity, however, of this section is evident from the fact that these three chapters, confessedly so important and interesting in themselves, might be taken away without leaving any perceptible void. From <a href="../../par/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a> the narrative is continued in chapter 25, apparently without a break, and in that chapter there is no mention of Balaam. It is only in chapter 31. (verses 8, 16) that two passing allusions are made to him: in the one his death is noted without comment; in the other we are made acquainted for the first time with a fact which throws a most important light upon his character and career, of which no hint is given in the section before us. Thus it is evident that the story of Balaam's coming and prophecies, although <span class="accented">imbedded</span> in the narrative (and that in the fight place as to order of time), is not structurally connected with it, but forms an episode by itself. If we now take this section, which is thus isolated and self-contained, we shall not fail to see at once that its literary character is strikingly peculiar. It is to all intents and purposes a sacred drama wherein characters and events of the highest interest are handled with consummate art. No one can be insensible to this, whatever construction he may or may not put upon it. Probably the story of Balaam was never made the subject of a miracle play, because the character of the chief actor is too subtle for the crude intelligence of the age of miracle plays. But if the sacred drama were ever reintroduced, it is certain that no more effective play could be found than that of Balaam and Balak. The extraordinary skill with which the strangely complex character of the wizard prophet is drawn out; the felicity with which it is <span class="accented">contrasted</span> with the rude simplicity of Balak; the picturesque grandeur of the scenery and incident; and the art with which the story leads up by <span class="accented">successive</span> stages to the final and complete triumph of God and of Israel, are worthy, from a merely artistic point of view, of the greatest of dramatic poets. There is no such minute drawing out of an isolated character by means of speech and incident to be found in the Old Testament, unless it be in the Book of Job, the dramatic form of which serves to give point to the comparison; but few would fail to see that the much more subtle character of Balaam is far more distinctly indicated than that of Job. Balaam is emphatically a "study," and must have been intended to he so. Yet it must be remembered that it is only to modern eyes that this part of the varied truth and wisdom of Holy Scripture has become manifest. To the Jew  Balaam was interesting only as a great foe, greatly baffled; as a sorcerer whose ghostly power and craft was broken and turned backward by the God of Israel (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-5.htm">Deuteronomy 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-10.htm">Joshua 24:10</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5</a>). To the Christian of the first age he was only interesting as the Scriptural type of the subtlest and most dangerous kind of enemy whom the Church of God had to dread - the enemy who united spiritual pretensions with persuasions to vice (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>). To the more critical intellects of later ages, such even as Augustine and Jerome, he was altogether a puzzle; the one regarding him as <span class="accented">prophetam diaboli</span>, whose religion was a mere cloak for covetousness; the other as <span class="accented">prophetam Dei</span>, whose fall was like unto the fall of the old prophet of Bethel. The two parallel allusions to his character in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a> do not take us any further, merely turning upon the covetousness which was his most obvious fault. Unquestionably, however, Balaam is most interesting to us, not from any of these points of view, but as a study drawn by an inspired hand of a strangely but most naturally mixed character, the broad features of which are constantly being reproduced, in the same unhallowed union, in men of all ]ands and ages. This is undeniably one of the instances (not perhaps very numerous) in which the more trained and educated intelligence of modern days has a distinct advantage over the simpler faith and intenser piety of the first ages. The conflict, or rather the compromise, in Balaam between true religion and superstitious imposture, between an actual Divine inspiration and the practice of heathen sorceries, between devotion to God and devotion to money, was an unintelligible puzzle to men of old. To those who have grasped the character of a Louis XI, of a Luther, or of an Oliver Cromwell, or have gauged the mixture of highest and lowest in the religious movements of modern history, the wonder is, not that such an one should have been, but that such an one should have been so simply and yet so skillfully depicted. Two questions arise pre-eminently out of the story of Balaam which our want of knowledge forbids us to answer otherwise than doubtfully. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> Whence did Balaam derive his knowledge of the true God, and how far did it extend? Was he, as some have argued, a heathen sorcerer who took to invoking Jehovah because circumstances led him to believe that the cause of Jehovah was likely to be the winning cause? and did the God whom he invoked in this mercenary spirit (after the fashion of the sons of Sceva) take advantage of the fact to obtain an ascendancy over his mind, and to compel his unwilling obedience? Such an assumption seems at once unnatural and unnecessary. It is hardly conceivable that God should have bestowed a true prophetic gift upon one who stood in such a relation to him. Moreover, the kind of ascendancy which the word of God had over the mind of Balaam is not one which springs from calculation, or from a mere intellectual persuasion. The man who lives before us in these chapters has not only a considerable knowledge of, but a very large amount of faith in, the one true God; he walks with God; he sees him that is invisible; the presence of Gods and God's direct concern about his doings are as familiar and unquestioned elements of his everyday life as they were of Abraham's. In a word (whatever difficulties a shallow theology may find in the fact), he has religious faith in God, a faith which is naturally strong, and has been further intensified by special revelations of the unseen; and this faith is the basis and condition of his prophetic gift. Balaam's religion, therefore, on this side was neither an hypocrisy nor an assumption; it was a real conviction which had grown up with him and formed part of his inner self. It is true that in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a> he is called a soothsayer (<span class="accented">kosem</span>), a name of reproach and  infamy among the Jews (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, "witchcraft;" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>, "divination"); but no one doubts that he played for gain the part of a soothsayer, employing with more or less of inward unbelief and contempt the arts of heathen sorcery; and it was quite natural that Joshua should recognize only the lower and more obvious side of his enemy's character. It remains then to consider how Balaam, living in Mesopotamia, could have had so considerable a knowledge of the true God; and the only satisfactory answer is this, that such knowledge had never disappeared from that region. Every glimpse which is afforded us of the descendants of Nahor in their Mesopotamian home confirms the belief that they were substantially at one with the chosen family in religious feeling and religious speech. Bethuel and Laban acknowledged the same God, and called him by the same name as Isaac and Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>). No doubt idolatrous practices prevailed in their household (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>), but that, however dangerous, was not fatal to the existence of the true faith amongst them, any more than is the existence of a similar cultus amongst Christians. Centuries had indeed passed away since the days of Laban, and during those centuries we may well conclude that the common people had developed the idolatrous practices of their fathers, until they wholly obscured the worship of the one true God. But the lapse of years and the change of popular belief make little difference to the secret and higher teaching of countries like the Mesopotamia of that age, which is intensely conservative both for good and evil. Men like Balaam, who probably had an hereditary claim to his position as a seer, remained purely monotheistic in creed, and in their hearts called only upon the God of all the earth, the God of Abraham and of Nahor, of Melchizedec and of Job, of Laban and of Jacob. If we knew enough of the religious history of that land, it is possible that we might be able to point to a tolerably complete succession of gifted (in many cases Divinely-gifted) men, servants and worshippers of the one true God, down to the Magi who first hailed the rising of the bright and morning Star. There is connected with this question another of much narrower interest which causes great perplexity. Balaam (and indeed Balak too) freely uses the sacred name by which God had revealed himself as the God of Israel (see on Exodus 6:2, 3). There are two views of this matter, one or other of which is tolerably certain, and for both of which much may be said: either the sacred name was widely known and used beyond the limits of Israel, or else the sacred historian must have freely put it into the mouths of people who actually used some other name. There are also two views both of which may be summarily rejected, because their own advocates have reduced them to absolute absurdity: the one is, that the use of the two names Elohim and Jehovah shows a difference of authorship; the other, that they are employed by the same author with variety of sense - Elohim (God) being the God of nature, Jehovah (the Lord) the God of grace. It is no doubt true that there are passages where the sole use, or the pointed use, of one or other of these names does really point to a diversity either of authorship or of meaning; but it is abundantly clear that in the general narrative of Scripture, including these chapters, not the least distinction whatever can be drawn between the use of Elohim and Jehovah which will stand the simplest test of common sense; the same ingenuity which explains the occurrence of Elohim instead of Jehovah in any particular sentence would find an explanation quite as satisfactory if it were Jehovah instead of Elohim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> Whence did Moses obtain his knowledge of the incidents here recorded, many  of which must have been known to Balaam alone? Was it directly, by revelation; or from some memorials left by Balaam himself? The former supposition, once generally held, is as generally abandoned now, because it is perceived that inspiration over-ruled and utilized for Divine purposes, but did not supersede, natural sources of information. The latter supposition is rendered more probable by these considerations: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That a man of Balaam's character and training would be very likely to put on record the remarkable things which had happened to himself. Such men who habitually lead a double life are often keenly. alive to their own errors, and are singularly frank in writing themselves down for the benefit of posterity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That Balaam was slain among the Midianites, and that his effects must have fallen into the hands of the victors. On the other hand, it is inconceivable that Balaam, being what he was, should have written these chapters at all as they stand; the moral and religious intent of the story is too evident in itself, and is too evidently governed by Jewish faith and feeling. It may be allowable to put it before the reader as an opinion which may or may not be true, but which is quite compatible with profound belief in the inspired truth of this part of God's word, that Moses, having obtained the facts in the way above indicated, was moved to work them up into the dramatic form in which they now appear - a form which undoubtedly brings out the character of the actors, the struggle between light and darkness, and the final triumph of light, with much more force (and therefore much more truth) than anything else could. If it be <span class="accented">objected</span> that this gives a fictitious character to the narrative, it may be replied that when the imagination is called into exercise to present actual facts, existing characters, and prophecies really uttered in a striking light, - and that under the over-ruling guidance of the Divine Spirit, - the result cannot be called fictitious in any bad or unworthy sense. If it be added that such a theory attributes to this section a character different from the rest of the Book, it may be allowed at once. The episode of Balaam and Balak is obviously, as to literary form, distinct from and strongly contrasted with the narrative which precedes and follows. It has been made a question as to the language in which Balaam and his companions spoke and wrote. The discovery of the Moabite stone has made it certain that the language of the Moabites, and in all probability of the other races descended from Abraham and Lot, was practically the same as the language of the Jews. Balaam's own tongue may have been Aramaic, but amongst his western friends and patrons he would no doubt he perfectly ready to speak as they spoke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 22:1-40.

A "Bela son of Beer" is named in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a> as reigning in Edom, but the coincidence is of no importance: kings and magicians have always loved to give themselves names of fear, and their vocabulary was not extensive. <span class="cmt_word">To Pother, which</span> is by <span class="cmt_word">the river of the land of the children of his people.</span> Rather, "which is on the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the great river Euphrates, "in the land of the children of his people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his native land.

This would hardly have been said when Israel was encamped thirty miles north of Arnon, opposite to Jericho. The two embassies to Balaam must have occupied some time, and in the mean while Israel would have gone further on his way. We may naturally conclude that the first message was sent immediately after the defeat of Sihon, at a time when Israel was encamped very near the border of Moab.

No doubt, however, Balak, like other heathens, had a profound though capricious belief in the real effect of curses and anathemas pronounced by men who had private intercourse and influence with the unseen powers. That error, like most superstitions, was the perversion of a truth; there are both benedictions and censures which, uttered by human lips, carry with them the sanction and enforcement of Heaven. The error of antiquity lay in ignorance or forgetfulness that, as water cannot rise higher than its source, so neither blessing nor cursing can possibly take any effect beyond the will and purpose of the Father of our souls. Balaam knew this, but it was perhaps his misfortune to have been trained from childhood to maintain his position and his wealth by trading upon the superstitions of his neighbours.

The ease with which, among ignorant and superstitious people, a prophet might become a hired soothsayer is apparent even from the case of Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>). That it should be thought proper to resort to the man of God for information about some lost property, and much more that it should be thought necessary to pay him a fee for the exercise of his supernatural powers, shows, not indeed that Samuel was a soothsayer, for he was a man of rare integrity and independence, but, that Samuel was but little distinguished from a soothsayer in the popular estimation. If Samuel had learnt to care more for money than for righteousness, he might very easily have become just what Balaam became.

It is truly said, however, that a passing illusion of this kind, while it testifies that the Apostle understood the words, like all his contemporaries, in their most natural and simple sense, does not oblige us to hold the same view; if he was mistaken in this matter, it does not at all affect the inspired truth of his teaching. Two theories, therefore, have been proposed in order to avoid the difficulties of the ordinary belief, while vindicating the reality of the occurrence. It has been held by some that the whole affair took place in a trance, and resembled St. Peter's vision of the sheet let down from heaven (<a href="../../par/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a>), which we rightly conceive to have been purely subjective. This is open to the obvious and apparently fatal objection that no hint is given of any state of trance or ecstasy, and that, on the contrary, the wording of the narrative as given to us is inconsistent with such a thing. In verse 31 Balaam's eyes are said to have been opened so that he saw the angel; but to have the eyes open so that the (ordinarily) invisible became visible, and the (otherwise) inaudible became audible, was precisely the condition of which Balaam speaks (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3, 4</a>) as that of trance. According to the narrative, therefore, Balaam was in an ecstasy, if at all, after the speaking of the ass, and not before. By others it has been put forward, somewhat confusedly, that although Balaam was in his ordinary senses, he did not really hear a human voice, but that the "cries" of the ass became intelligible to his mind; and it is noted that as an augur he had been accustomed to assign meanings to the cries of animals. If instead of "cries" we read "brayings," for the ass is endowed by nature with no other capacity of voice, being indeed one of the dumbest of "dumb" animals, we have the matter more fairly before us. To most people it would appear more incredible that the brayings of an ass should convey these rational questions to the mind of its rider than that the beast should have spoken outright with a man's voice. It would indeed seem much more satisfactory to regard the story, if we cannot accept it as literally true, as a parable which Balaam wrote against himself, and which Moses simply incorporated in the narrative; we should at least preserve in this way the immense moral and spiritual value of the story, without the necessity of placing non-natural constructions upon its simple statements. Supposing the miracle to have really occurred, it must always be observed that the words put into the ass's mouth do nothing more than express such feeling's as a docile and intelligent animal of her kind would have actually felt. That domestic animals, and especially such as have been long in the service of man, feel surprise,  indignation, and grief in the presence of injustice and ill-treatment is abundantly certain. In many well-authenticated cases they have done things in order to express these feelings which seemed as much beyond their "irrational" nature as if they had spoken. We constantly say of a dog or a horse that he can do everything but speak, and why should it seem incredible that God, who has given the dumb beast so close an approximation to human feeling and reason, should for once have given it human voice? With respect to Balaam's companions, their presence need not cause any difficulty. The princes of Midian and Moab had probably gone on to announce the coming of Beldam; his servants would naturally follow him at some little distance, unless he summoned them to his side. It is very likely too that Balaam was wont to carry on conversations with himself, or with imaginary beings, as he rode along, and this circumstance would account for any sound of voices which reached the ears of others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/22-29.htm">Numbers 22:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Balaam said unto the ass.</span> That Beldam should answer the ass without expressing any astonishment is certainly more marvelous than that the ass should speak to him. It must, however, in fairness be considered - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Balaam was a prophet. He was accustomed to hear Divine voices speaking to him when no man was near. He had a large and unquestioning faith, and a peculiar familiarity with the unseen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Balaam was a sorcerer. It was part of his profession to show signs and wonders such as even now in those countries confound the most experienced and skeptical beholders. It is likely that he had often made dumb animals speak in order to bewilder others. He must indeed have been conscious to some extent of imposture, but he would not draw any sharp line in his own mind between the marvels which really happened to him and the marvels he displayed to others. Both as prophet and as sorcerer, he must have lived, more than any other even of that age, in an atmosphere of the supernatural. If, therefore, this portent was really given, it was certainly given to the very man of all that ever lived to whom it was most suitable. Just as one cannot imagine the miracle of the stater (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a>) happening to any one of less simple and childlike faith than St. Peter, so one could not think of the ass as speaking to any one in the Bible but the wizard prophet, for whom - both on his good and on his bad side - the boundary lines between the natural and supernatural were almost obliterated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Balaam was at this moment intensely angry., and nothing blunts the edge of natural surprise so much as rage. Things which afterwards, when calmly recollected, cause the utmost astonishment, notoriously produce no effect at the moment upon a mind which is thoroughly exasperated.

The answer is that the angel was not a warning, but a destroying, angel, a visible embodiment of the anger of God which burnt against Beldam for his perversity. The angel would have slain Balaam, as the lion slew the disobedient prophet, but that God in his mercy permitted the fidelity and wisdom of the ass to save her master from the immediate consequences of his folly.

Indeed the known fact that Beldam was a prophet of the Lord was no doubt one of Balak's chief reasons for wishing to obtain his services. Balak shared the common opinion of antiquity, that the various national deities were enabled by circumstances past human understanding to do sometimes more, sometimes less, for their  special votaries. He perceived that the God of Israel was likely, as things stood, to carry all before him; but he thought that he might by judicious management be won over, at least to some extent, to desert the cause of Israel and to favour that of Moab. To this end he "retained" at great cost the services of Balaam, the prophet of the Lord, and to this end he was willing to offer any number of sacrifices. Even the resolute and self-reliant Romans believed in the wisdom of such a policy. Thus Pliny quotes ancient authors as affirming "in oppugnationibus ante omnia solitum a Romanis sacrdotibus evocari Deum, cujus in tutela id oppidum esset, promittique illi eundem aut ampliorem apud Romanos cultum," and he adds, "durat in Pontificum disciplina id sacrum, constatque ideo occultatum, in cujus Dei tutela Roma esset, ne qui hostium simili modo agerent." And sent, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, portions of the sacrificial meats. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 22:41; 23, 24

Perhaps the Bamoth mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-19.htm">Numbers 21:19, 20</a>. This is, however, by no means certain, because high places were no doubt numerous, and that Bamoth would seem to have been too far from the present camp of Israel.

The number seven was especially connected with the revelation of the tree God, the Creator of the world, and was probably observed here for this reason.

It might be concluded from <a href="../../par/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a> that Balaam went only to look for "auguries," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for such natural signs in the flight of birds and the like as the heathen were wont to observe as manifestations of the favour or disfavour of God, the success or failure of enterprises. It seems clear that it was his practice to do so, either as having some faith himself in such uncertainties, or as stooping to usual heathen arts which he inwardly despised. But from the fact that God met him (we know not how), and that such supernatural communication was not unexpected, we may conclude that Balaam's words meant more for himself than the mere observance of auguries, whatever they may have meant for Balak. To an high place. Rather, "to a bald place" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> - compare the meaning of "Calvary"), from which the immediate prospect was uninterrupted.

Balaam's utterances were in the highest degree poetical, according to the antithetic form of the poetry of that day, which delighted in sustained parallelisms, in lofty figures, and in abrupt turns. The <span class="accented">"mashal"</span> of Balaam resembled the "burden" of the later prophets in this, that it was not a discourse uttered to men, but a thing revealed in him of which he had to deliver himself as best he might in such words as came to him. His inward eye was fixed on this revelation, and he gave utterance to it without consideration of those who heard. Aram, i.e., Aram-Naharaim, or Mesopotamia (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). Defy, or "threaten,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with the wrath of Heaven. Jacob.

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, apparently from an incorrect reading.

If the former reference was intended, Balaam must have had a much fuller and happier knowledge of "life and immortality" than the Israelites themselves, to whom death was dreadful, all the more that it ended a life protected and blessed by God (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). It is hardly credible that so singular an anticipation of purely Christian feeling should really be found in the mouth of a prophet of that day, for it is clear that the words, however much inspired, did express the actual emotion of Balaam at the moment. It is therefore more consistent with the facts and probabilities of the case to suppose that Balaam referred to righteous Abraham (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) and his immediate descendants, and wished that when he came to die he might have as sure a hope as they had enjoyed that God would bless and multiply their seed, and make their name to be glorious in the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Let my last end be like his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (last end) is the same word translated "latter days" and "latter end" in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14, 20</a>.

This is in accordance with the statement in <a href="../../par/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, and it would certainly seem as if Balak and Balaam moved each time nearer to that encampment which was for different masons the center of attraction to them both.

It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>). The former seems most in keeping here. His king shall be higher than Agag. Rather, "let his king be higher than Agag." The name Agag (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>, the fiery one) does not occur again except as the name of the king of Amalek whom Saul conquered and Samuel slew (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.); yet it may safely be assumed that it was the official title of all the kings of Amalek, resembling in this "Abimelech" and "Pharaoh." Here it seems to stand for the dynasty and the nation of the Amalekites, and there is no reason to suppose that any reference was intended to any particular individual or event in the distant future. The "king" of Israel here spoken of is certainly not Saul or any other of the kings, but God himself in his character as temporal Ruler of Israel; and the "kingdom" is the kingdom of heaven as set forth by way of anticipation in the polity and order of the chosen race. As a fact, Israel had afterwards a visible king who overthrew Agag, but their having such a king was alien to the mind of God, and due to a distinct falling away from national faith, and therefore could find no place in this prophecy.

The difficulty is the possessive suffix to "arrows," which is in the singular; otherwise this rendering gives a much better sense, and more in keeping with the rest of the passage The image in Balaam's mind is evidently that of a terrible wild beast devouring his enemies, stamping them underfoot, and dashing to pieces in his fury the arrows or darts which they vainly launch against him (compare the imagery in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>).

The Vulgate here has followed the surmise of the Jewish commentators, who saw nothing in Balaam but the arch-enemy of their race, and has actually altered the text into "dabo consilium quid populus tuus populo huic faciat" (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>).

This expression alone distinguishes this introduction of Balaam's mashal from the former one (verses 3, 4), but it is difficult to say that it really adds anything to our understanding of his mental state. If we ask when Balaam had received the revelation which he now proceeds to communicate, it would seem most natural to reply that it was made known to him when "the Spirit of God came upon him," and that Balak's anger had interrupted him in the midst of his mashal, or possibly he had kept it back, as too distasteful to his patron, until he saw that he had nothing more to expect from that quarter.

Balaam does not mean to say that he expected himself to see at any future time the mysterious Being of whom he speaks, who is identical with the "Star"  and the "Scepter" of the following clauses; he speaks wholly as a prophet, and means that his inner gaze is fixed upon such an one, with full assurance that he exists in the counsels of God, but with clear recognition of the fact that his actual coming is yet in the far future. <span class="cmt_word">There shall come a Star out</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Jacob.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may quite as well be rendered by the present; Balaam simply utters what passes before his inward vision. The star is a natural and common poetic symbol of an illustrious, or, as we say, "brilliant," personage, and as such recurs many times in Scripture (cf. <a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>). The celebrated Jewish fanatic called himself Barcochab, "son of the Star," in allusion to this prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">A Scepter shall rise out of Israel.</span> This further defines the "star ' as a ruler of men, for the scepter is Used in that sense in the dying prophecy of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), with which Balaam was evidently acquainted. Accordingly the Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall smite the corners of Moab.</span> Rather, "the two corners" (dual), or "the two sides of Moab," i.e., shall crush Moab on either side. <span class="cmt_word">And destroy all the children of Sheth.</span> In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, where this prophecy is in a manner quoted, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">qarqar</span>, destroy) is altered into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">quadqod</span>, crown of the head). This raises a very curious and interesting question as to the use made by the prophets of the earlier Scriptures, but it gives no authority for an alteration of the text. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> has been variously rendered. The Jewish commentators, followed by the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;</span>) and the older versions, understand it to mean the sons of Seth, the son of Adam, i.e., all mankind. Many modern commentators, however, take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a> - "desolation"), and read "sons of confusion," as equivalent to the unruly neighbours and relations of Israel. This, however, is extremely dubious in itself, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> nowhere occurs in this sense, and derives no sup. port from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. It is true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> is there replaced by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "sons of tumult," but then this very verse affords the clearest evidence that the prophet felt no hesitation in altering the text of Scripture to suit his own inspired purpose. If it be true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> will not bear the meaning given to it in the Targums of "reign over," still there is no insuperable difficulty in the common rendering. Jewish prophecy, from beginning to end, contemplated the Messiah as the Conqueror, the Subduer, and even the Destroyer of all the heathen, i.e., of all who were not Jews. It is only in the New Testament that the iron scepter with which he was to dash in pieces the heathen (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>) becomes the pastoral staff wherewith he shepherds them (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> after the Septuagint, which has here misread the text). The prophecy was that Messiah should destroy the heathen; the fulfillment that he destroyed not them, but their heathenism (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6-9</a> with <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>).

It was indeed the very first of the nations to attack Israel, but it is a most arbitrary treatment of the words to understand them in that sense. The prophet Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) uses the same expression of the Jewish aristocracy of his day. As it was in no better position than Amalek to claim it in any true sense, we can but suppose that in either case there is a reference to the vainglorious vauntings of the people threatened; it would be quite in keeping with the Bedawin character if Amalek gave himself out be "the first of nations." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a></div><div class="verse">And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He looked on the Kenites.</span> This <span class="accented">mashal</span> is excessively obscure, for both the subject of it and the drift of it are disputed. On the one hand, the Kenites are mentioned among the Canaanitish tribes that were to be dispossessed, in Gem 15:19; on the other, they are identified with the Midianitish tribe to which Hobab and Raguel belonged, in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, and apparently in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a> (see on Numbers 10:29). It has been supposed that the friendly Kenites had by this time loft the camp of Israel and established themselves  by conquest in the south of Canaan, and even that they had occupied the territory and taken the name of the original Kenites of <a href="../../par/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>. This, however, is a mere conjecture, and a very improbable one. That a weak tribe like that of Hobab should have done what Israel had not dared to do, and settled themselves by force of arms in Southern Palestine, and, further, that they should be already known by the name of those whom they had destroyed, is extremely unlikely, and is inconsistent with the statement in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</span> Rather, "and thy nest laid (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) upon a rock." We do not know where the Kenites dwelt, and therefore we cannot tell whether this expression is to be understood literally or figuratively. If the Canaanitish tribe is here spoken of, it is very likely they had their residence in some strong mountain fastness, but if the Midianitish tribe, then there is no reason to suppose that they had crossed the Jordan at all In that case the "nest" must be wholly figurative, and must refer to that strong confidence which they placed in the protection of the God of Israel.

Indeed the Targum of Palestine makes mention of Italy here, and the Vulgate actually translates "venient in trieribus de Italia." There is, however, no reason to suppose that Balaam knew or spoke of anything further than Cyprus. It was "from the side of" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) Cyprus that the ships of his vision came down upon the Phoenician coasts, wherever their original starting-point may have been.

It is not likely, however, that Balaam would have substituted "Eber" for the "Jacob" and "Israel" which he had previously used. The Targum of Onkelos paraphrases "Eber" by "beyond the Euphrates," and that of Palestine has "all the sons of Eber." From Gem 10:21 it would appear that "the children of Eber" were the same as the Shemites; Asshur, therefore, was himself included in Eber, but is separately mentioned on account of his fame and power. <span class="cmt_word">And he also shall perish forever.</span> The subject of this prophecy is left in obscurity. It is difficult on grammatical grounds to refer it to Asshur, and it does not seem appropriate to "Eber." It may mean that the unnamed conquering race which should overthrow the Asian monarchies should itself come to an end for evermore; or it may be that Balaam added these words while he beheld with dismay the coming destruction of his own Shemitic race, and their final subjugation by more warlike powers. It must be remembered that the Greek empire, although overthrown, did not by any means "perish for ever" in the same sense as the previous empires of the East.

It is doubtful whether this expression, which is used in <a href="../../par/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a> and in other places, implies that Balaam returned to his home on the Euphrates. If he did he must have retraced his steps almost immediately, because he was slain among the Midianites shortly after (chapter 31:8). The phrase, however, may merely mean that he set off homewards, and is not inconsistent with the supposition that he went no further on his way than the headquarters of the Midianites. It is not difficult to understand the infatuation which would keep him within reach of a people so strange and terrible.  <span class="ref_word">NOTE ON THE PROPHECIES OF BALAAM.</span> That the prophecies of Balaam have a Messianic character, and are only to be fully understood in a Christian sense, seems to lie upon the face of them. The Targums of Onkelos and Palestine make mention of King Meshiba here, and the great mass of Christian interpretation has uniformly followed in the track of Jewish tradition. It is of course possible to get rid of the prophetic element altogether by assuming that the utterances of Balaam were either composed or largely interpolated after the events to which they seem to refer. It would be necessary in this case to bring their real date down to the period of the Macedonian conquests, and much later still if the Greek empire also was to "perish for ever." The difficulty and arbitrary character of such an assumption becomes the more evident the more it is considered; nor does it seem consistent with the form into which the predictions are cast. A patriotic Jew looking <span class="accented">back</span> from the days of Alexander or his successors would not call the great Eastern power by the name of Asshur, because two subsequent empires had arisen in the place of Assyria proper. But that Balaam, <span class="accented">looking forward</span> down the dim vista of the future, should see Asshur, and only Asshur, is in perfect keeping with what we know of prophetic perspective, - the further off the events descried by inward vision, the more extreme the foreshortening, - according to which law it is well known that the first and second advents of Christ are inextricably blended in almost every case. If we accept the prophecies as genuine, it is, again, only possible to reject the Messianic element by assuming that no Jewish prophecy overleaps the narrow limits of Jewish history. The mysterious Being whom Balaam descries in the undated future, who is the King of Israel, and whom he identifies with the Shiloh of Jacob's dying prophecy, and who is to bring to nought all nations of the world, cannot be David, although David may anticipate him in many ways; still less, as the reference to Agag, Amalek, and the Kenites might for a moment incline us to believe, can it be Saul. At the same time, while the Messianic element in the prophecy cannot reasonably be ignored, it is obvious that it does not by any means exist by itself; it is so mixed up with what is purely local and temporal in the relations between Israel and the petty tribes which surrounded and envied him, that it is impossible to isolate it or to exhibit it in any clear and definite form. The Messiah indeed appears, as it were, upon the stage in a mysterious and remote grandeur; but he appears with a slaughter weapon in his hand, crushing such enemies of Israel as were then and there formidable, and exterminating the very fugitives from the overthrow. Even where the vision loses for once its local colouring in one way, so that the King of Israel deals with all the sons of men, yet it retains it in another, for he deals with them in wrath and destruction, not in love and blessing. There is here so little akin to the true ideal, that we are readily tempted to say that Christ is not here at all, but only Saul or David, or the Jewish monarchy personified in the ruthlessness of its consolidated power. But if we know anything of the genius of prophecy, it is exactly this, that the future and the grand and the heavenly is seen through a medium of the present and the paltry and the earthly. The Messianic element almost always occurs in connection with some crisis in the outward history of the chosen people; it is inextricably mixed up with what is purely local in interest, and often with what is distinctly imperfect in morality. To the Jew - and to Balaam also, however unwillingly, as the servant of Jehovah - the cause of Israel was the cause of God; he could not discern between them. "Our country, right or wrong," was an impossible sentiment to him, because he could not conceive of his country being wrong; he knew nothing of moral victories, or the  triumphs of defeat or of suffering; he could not think of God's kingdom as asserting itself in any other way than in the overthrow, or (better still) the annihilation, of Moab, Edom, Assyria, Babylon, Rome, the whole world which was not Israel. The sufferings of the vanquished, the horrors of sacked cities, the agonies of desolated homes, were nothing to him; nothing, unless it were joy - joy that the kingdom of God should be exalted in the earth, joy that the reign of wickedness should be broken. All these feelings belonged to a most imperfect morality and we rightly look upon them with horror, because we have (albeit as yet very imperfectly) conformed our sentiments to a higher standard. But it was the very condition of the old dispensation that God adopted the then moral code, such as it was, and hallowed it with religious sanctions, and gave it a strong direction God-ward, and so educated his own for something higher. Hence it is wholly natural and consistent to find this early vision of the Messiah, the heaven-sent King of Israel, introduced in connection with the fall of the petty pastoral state of Moab. To Balaam, standing where he did in time and place, and all the more because his personal desires went with Moab as against Israel, Moab stood forth as the representative kingdom of darkness, Israel as the kingdom of light, Through that strong, definite, narrow, and essentially imperfect, but not untrue, conviction of his he saw the Messiah, and he saw him crushing Moab first, and then trampling down all the rest of a hostile world. That no one would have been more utterly astonished if he had beheld the Messiah as he was, is certain; but that is not at all inconsistent with the belief that he really prophesied concerning him. That he should put all enemies under his feet was what Balaam truly saw; but he saw it and gave utterance to it according to the ideas and imagery of which his mind was full. God ever reveals the supernatural through the natural, the heavenly through the earthly, the future through the present. It remains to consider briefly the temporal fulfillments of Balaam's prophecies. Moab was not apparently seriously attacked until the time of David, when it was vanquished, and a great part of the inhabitants slaughtered (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). In the division of the kingdom it fell to the share of Israel, with the other lands beyond Jordan, but the vicissitudes of the northern monarchy gave it opportunities to rebel, of which it successfully availed itself after the death of Ahab (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>). Only in the time of John Hyrcanus ( <span class="date">B.C. 129</span>) was it finally subdued, and ceased to have an independent existence. Edom was also conquered for the first time by David, and the people as far as possible exterminated (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>). Nevertheless, it was able to shake off the yoke under Joram (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>), and, although defeated, was never again subdued (see on Genesis 27:40). The prophecies against Edom were indeed taken up again and again by the prophets (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Obadiah), but we must hold that they were never adequately fulfilled, unless we look for a spiritual realization not in wrath, but in mercy. The later Jews themselves came to regard "Edom" as a Scriptural synonym for all who hated and oppressed them. Amalek was very thoroughly overthrown by Saul, acting under the directions of Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7, 8</a>), and never appears to have regained any national existence. Certain bands of Amalekites were smitten by David, and others at a later period in the reign of Hezekiah by the men of Simeon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39-43</a>). The prophecy concerning the Kenites presents, as noted above, great difficulty, because it is impossible to know certainly whether the older Kenites of Genesis or the later Kenites of 1 Samuel are intended. In either case, however, it must be acknowledged that sacred history throws no light whatever on the fulfillment of the prophecy; we know nothing at all as to the fate of this small clan. No doubt it ultimately  shared the lot of all the inhabitants of Palestine, with the exception of Judah and Jerusalem, and was transplanted by one of the Assyrian generals to some far-off spot, where its very existence as a separate people was lost. The "ships from the side of Cyprus" clearly enough represent in the vision of Balaam invaders from over the western seas, as opposed to previous conquerors from over the eastern deserts and mountains. That the invasion of Alexander the Great was not actually made by the way of Cyprus is nothing to the point. It was never any part of spiritual illumination to extend geographical knowledge. To Balaam's mind the only open way from the remote and unknown western lands was the waterway by the sides of Cyprus, and accordingly he saw the hostile fleets gliding down beneath the lee of those sheltering coasts towards the harbours of Phoenicia. Doubtless the ships which Balaam saw were rigged as ships were rigged in Balaam's time, and not as in the time of Alexander. But the rigging, like the route, belonged to the local and personal medium through which the prophecy came, not to the prophecy itself. As a fact it remains true that a maritime power from the West, whose home was beyond Cyprus, did overwhelm the older power which stood in the place and inherited the empire of Assyria. Whether the subsequent ruin of this maritime power also is part of the prophecy must remain doubtful. <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/25.htm"><title>Numbers 25 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/25.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/25.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/25-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/24.htm" title="Numbers 24">&#9668;</a> Numbers 25 <a href="../numbers/26.htm" title="Numbers 26">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abode in Shittim.</span> For a considerable time; from their first arrival in the Arboth Moab until the crossing of the Jordan.

The woman's name is given again in verse 18, as if for the first time. We may probably conclude that verses 14, 15 were inserted into the narrative either by the hand of Moses himself at a later date, or possibly by some subsequent hand. Zimri.

We may think of the women of Moab as merely indulging their individual passions after their wonted manner, but of the women of Midian as employed by their rulers, on the advice of Balsam, in a deliberate plot to entangle the Israelites in heathen rites and heathen sins which would alienate from them the favour of God. <span class="ref_word">NOTE ON THE ZEAL OF PHINEHAS.</span> The act of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, in slaying Zimri and Cozbi is one of the most memorable in the Old Testament; not so much, however, in itself, as in the commendation bestowed upon it by God. It is unquestionably surprising at first sight that an act of unauthorized zeal, which might so readily be made (as indeed it was  made) the excuse for deeds of murderous fanaticism, should be commended in the strongest terms by the Almighty; that an act of summary vengeance, which we find it somewhat hard to justify on moral grounds, should be made in a peculiar sense and in a special degree the pattern of the great atonement wrought by the Saviour of mankind; but this aspect of the deed in the <span class="accented">eyes</span> of God by its very unexpectedness draws our attention to it, and obliges us to consider wherein its distinctive religious character and excellence lay. It is necessary in the first place to point out that the act of Phinehas did really receive stronger testimony from God than any other act done <span class="accented">proprio motu</span> in the Old Testament. What he did was not done officially (for he held no office), nor was it clone by command (for the offenders were not under his jurisdiction as judge), nor in fulfillment of any revealed law or duty (for no blame would have attached to him if he had let it alone), and yet it had the same effect in staying the plague as the act of Aaron when he stood between the living and the dead with the hallowed fire in his hand (see on Numbers 16:46-48). Of both it is said that <span class="accented">"he</span> made an atonement for the people," and so far they both appear as having power with God to turn away his wrath and stay his avenging hand. But the atonement made by Aaron was official, for he was the anointed high priest, and, being made with incense from the sanctuary, it was mate in accordance with and upon the strength of a ceremonial law laid down by God whereby he had bound himself to exercise his Divine right of pardon. The act of Phinehas, on the contrary, had no legal or ritual value; there is no power of atonement in the blood of sinners, nor had the death of 24,000 guilty people had any effect in turning away the wrath of God from them that survived. It remains, therefore, a startling truth that the deed of Phinehas is the only act neither official nor commanded, but originating in the impulses of the actor himself, to which the power of atoning for sin is ascribed in the Old Testament: for although in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a> David speaks of making an atonement by giving up seven of Saul's sons, it is evident from the context that the "atonement" was made to the Gibeonites, and not directly to the Lord. Again, the act of Phinehas merited the highest reward from God, a reward which was promised to him in the most absolute terms. Because he had clone this thing he should have God's covenant of peace, he and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. This promise must mean that he and his seed should have power with God for ever to make peace between heaven and earth, and to make reconciliation for the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people; and, meaning this, it is a republication in favour of Phinehas, and in more absolute terms, of the covenant made with Levi as represented by Aaron (see on Malachi 2:4, 5). Nor is this all. In <a href="../../par/psalms/106-31.htm">Psalm 106:31</a> it is said of his deed that "it was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore." This word "counted" or "imputed" is the same (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) which is used of Abraham in <a href="../../par/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, and the very words of the Septuagint here (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) are applied to the obedience of Abraham in <a href="../../par/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. It appears then that righteousness was imputed to Phinehas, as to the father of the faithful, with this distinction, that to Phinehas it was imputed as an everlasting righteousness, which is not said of Abraham. Now if we compare the two, it must be evident that the act of Phinehas was not, like Abraham's, an act of self-sacrificing obedience, nor in any special sense an act of faith. While both acted under the sense of duty, the following of duty in Abraham's case put the greatest possible strain upon all the natural impulses of mind and heart; in the case of Phinehas it altogether coincided with the impulses of his own will. If  faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, it is clear that zeal was imputed to Phinehas for righteousness for evermore. This being so, it is necessary in the second place to point out that the act in question (like that of Abraham in sacrificing his son) was distinctly one of moral virtue according to the standard then Divinely allowed. An act which was in itself wrong, or of doubtful rectitude, could not form the ground for such praise and promise, even supposing that they really looked far beyond the act itself. Now it is clear <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that under no circumstances would a similar act be justifiable now; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that no precedent could be established by it then. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Jews indeed feigned a "zealot-right," examples of which they saw (amongst others) in the act of Samuel slaying Agag (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>), of Mattathias slaying the idolatrous Jew and the king's commissioner (1 Macc. 2:24-26), of the Sanhedrim slaying St. Stephen. But the last-mentioned case is evidence enough that in the absence of distinct Divine guidance zeal is sure to degenerate into fanaticism, or rather that it is impossible to distinguish zeal from fanaticism. Every such act must of necessity stand upon its own merits, for it can only be justified by the coexistence of two conditions which are alike beyond human certainty: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the deed is itself in accordance with the will of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the doing of it is inspired by motives, absolutely pure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Christ came to save men's lives, and that God would have all men to repent, has made for us the primary condition impossible, and therefore the act of Phinehas would be immoral now. No one may take life unless he has the mandate of the State for doing' so. But it was not so then; God was the King of Israel, and the foes of Israel were the foes of God, with whom there could be no peace or amity as long as they threatened the very existence of God's people and worship. The Israelite who indulged in sinful intercourse with a heathen was a rebel against his King and a traitor to his country; he became <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> an "outlaw," to slay whom was the bounden duty of every true patriot. If it be said that this view of things belongs to an inferior code of morality, which ignored the universal brotherhood of men and Fatherhood of God, that is admitted at once. The elder revelation founded itself plainly and avowedly upon the moral law as then universally held (and by no means supplanted yet by the higher law of Christ), that men were to love their brethren and hate their enemies. To complain that the act of Phinehas was moral in a Jewish and not in a Christian sense is only to find fault with God for suffering a confessedly imperfect and preparatory morality to do its work until the fullness of time was come. While, therefore, we recognize the act of Phinehas as one determined, in its outward form, by the imperfect morality of the dispensation under which he lived, it is necessary to look below the act to the spirit which animated it for its permanent value and significance. That spirit is clearly defined by the testimony of God - "while he was zealous with my zeal." The excellence of Phinehas was, that he was filled with a zeal which was itself Divine against sin, and that he acted fearlessly and promptly (whilst others apparently hesitated even when commanded) under the impulse of that zeal; in other words, what pleased God so greatly was to see his own hatred of sin, and his own desire to make it to cease, reflected in the mind and expressed in the deed of one who acted upon righteous impulse, not under any command or constraint. It is impossible, in the third place, not to see that this record throws a flood of light upon the doctrine of the atonement; for the act of Phinehas stands, in some respects, upon a higher level than all the types and shadows of the cross which had gone before; being neither an act of submission to a definite command, like the sacrifice of Isaac, nor a piece of ordered ritual, like the sending forth of the goat for Azazel;  but a spontaneous deed, having a moral value of its own. Partly at least for the sake of what it was, not merely what it showed in a figure, it was accepted as an atonement for the sin of Israel (which was very gross), and was imputed to its author for an everlasting righteousness. Phinehas, therefore, in one very important sense, would seem to bear a stronger resemblance to our Lord in his atoning work than any other person in the Old Testament. It may therefore be submitted that we must seek the truest ground of the atonement wrought by Christ not in the simple fact of the passion and death of the God-man, nor in the greatness or value of his sufferings as such; but in that zeal for God, that Divine indignation against sin as the opposite of God, that consuming desire to cause it to cease, which first animated the life of the Redeemer, and then informed his death. Phinehas in his measure, and according to his lights, was governed by the same Spirit, and surrendered himself to the prompting of the same Spirit, by which Christ offered himself without spot unto God. And that Spirit was the Spirit of a consuming zeal, wherein our Lord hastened with an entire eagerness of purpose (<a href="../../par/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27, 28</a>, &c.) to "condemn sin in the flesh" and so to glorify God, and to accomplish the object of his mission (<a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), not by the summary execution of individual sinners, but after an infinitely higher fashion, by the sacrifice of himself as the representative of the whole sinful race. Lastly, it must be noted that as the act of Phinehas enables us, almost more than anything else, to enter into the nature of our Lord's atonement, so it is only in the light of that atonement that we can justify to ourselves either the strength of the Divine commendation accorded to Phinehas, or the vastness of the promises made to him. For the deed was after all an act of violence, and a dangerous precedent, humanly speaking; and, on the other hand, the covenant of peace given to him and to his seed, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, failed to give any peace at all, save in a very broken and partial manner, and did not even continue in the keeping of his family. As the house of Eleazar was the elder of the two descended from Aaron, it would have been only natural that the high priestly dignity should remain with its members; as a fact, however, it passed to the house of Ithamar from the days of Eli until Solomon, for political reasons, deposed Abiathar in favour of Zadok; and it was lost for ever with the final fall of Jerusalem. As in so many cases, therefore, we have to acknowledge that the act of Phinehas was accepted as an atonement for the sake of that truer atonement which (in a remarkable sense) it anticipated; and that the promises given to Phinehas were only partially intended and partially fulfilled for him, while the true and eternal fulfillment was reserved for him of whom Phinehas was a figure. To Christ, in whom was combined an entire zeal against sin and an entire love for the sinner, was indeed given God's covenant of peace and an everlasting priesthood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The victims of the plague would surely be those who had joined themselves to Baal-Peor; and these again would surely be the younger, not the older, men in Israel.

Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. <span class="cmt_word">And they became a sign.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>properly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense.

The sons of Korah are frequently mentioned among the Levites, and Samuel himself would seem to have been of them (see on 1 Chronicles 6:22, 28, 33-38, and titles to <a href="../../par/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42, 88</a>, &c.); it is, however, slightly doubtful whether the Kohathite Korah of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a>, the ancestor of Samuel, is the same as the Izharite Korah, the ancestor of Heman, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-38.htm">1 Chronicles 6:38</a>.

It has been proposed to explain this on the ground of their both being pastoral tribes; but if the members of these tribes were more scattered than the rest, it would be just in their case that we should expect to find round numbers. The one fact which these figures establish in a startling way is, that while the nation as a whole remained heady stationary in point of numbers, the various tribes show a most unexpected variation. Manasseh, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, has increased his population 63 per cent. in spite of the fact that there is not one man left of sixty years of age, while Simeon has decreased in the same proportion. There is indeed little difficulty in accounting for diminishing numbers amidst so many hardships, and after so many plagues. The fact that Zimri belonged to the tribe of Simeon, and that this tribe was omitted soon after from the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>), may easily lead to the conclusion that Simeon was more than any other tribe involved in the sin of Baal-Peor and the punishment which followed. But when we compare, e. <span class="accented">g.</span>, the twin tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, concerning whom nothing distinctive is either stated or hinted, whether bad or good; and when we find that the one has decreased 20 percent and the other increased 63 percent during the same interval, and under the same general circumstances, we cannot even guess at the causes which must have been at work to produce so striking a difference. It is evident that each tribe had its own history apart from the general history of the nation - a history which had the most important results for its own members, but of which we know almost nothing. It is observable, however, that all the tribes under the leadership of Judah increased, whilst all those in the camp of Reuben decreased.

The smallness of the increase in a tribe which was excepted from the general doom at Kadesh, and which in other ways was so favourably situated, seems to point to some considerable losses. It is possible that portions of the tribe suffered severely for their share in the rebellion of Korah; if so, the families of the Shimites and of the Uzzielites may have been so much reduced as to be merged in the remaining families.

Apparently his daughters meant to acknowledge that they had no complaint against the Divine justice because of their father's death, but only against the law because of the unnecessary hardship which it inflicted upon them.

The request assumes that the "brethren" of Zelophehad would receive an inheritance in the promised land, either personally or as represented by their sons; hence it seems clear that Zelophehad was not of the elder generation, which had forfeited all their rights and expectations in Canaan, but of the younger, to whom the inheritance was transferred (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-32</a>). This is confirmed by the consideration that these women were not married until some time after this (<a href="../../par/numbers/36-11.htm">Numbers 36:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8, 4</a>), and must, therefore, according to the almost invariable custom, have been quite young at this time. It is reasonable to suppose that the heads of separate families to whom the land was distributed would be at this time men of from forty-five to sixty years of age, comprising the elder half of the generation which grew up in the wilderness. Zelophehad would have been among these, but that he was cut off, perhaps in the plague of serpents, or in the plague of the Arboth Mesh, and left only unmarried girls to represent him.

The Mosaic law of succession followed the same lines as the feudal law of Europe, equally disallowing disposition by will, and discouraging, if not disallowing, alienation by grant. Upon the land was to rest the whole social fabric of Israel, and all that was valued and permanent in family life and feeling was to be tied as it were to the landed inheritance. Hence the land was in every case so to pass that the name and fame, the privilege and duty, of the deceased owner might be as far as possible perpetuated. <span class="cmt_word">Unto his daughter.</span> Not for her maintenance, but in order that her husband might represent her father.

Moses was as much above the priests as he was above the tribe princes; but Joshua was only the civil and military head of the nation, and was as much subordinate to the high priest in one way as the high priest was subordinate to him in another. In after times no doubt the political headship quite overpowered and overshadowed the ecclesiastical, but this does not seem to have been so intended, or to have been the case in Eleazar's lifetime.

Rather, "who shall inquire for him in the judgment of Urim." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

The Urim of this passage and of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> seems identical with the Urim and Thummim of <a href="../../par/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>. What it actually was, and how it was used in con-suiting God, is not told us in Scripture, and has left no reliable trace in the tradition of the Jews; it must, therefore, remain for ever an insoluble mystery. It does not appear that Moses ever sought the judgment of Urim, for he possessed more direct means of ascertaining the will of God; nor does it seem ever to have been resorted to after the time of David, for the "more sure word of prophecy" superseded it. Its real use, therefore, belonged to the dark ages of Israel, after the light of Moses had set, and before the light of the prophets had arisen. At his word. Literally, after his mouth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the decision of Eleazar, given after consulting God by means of the Urim (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>).

It is obvious that the formula with which the section opens might be used with equal propriety to introduce a digest of the law on this subject compiled by Moses himself, or by some subsequent editor of his writings from a number of scattered regulations, written or oral, which had Divine authority. It is indeed quite true that this routine of sacrifice was only suitable for times of settled habitation in the promised land, and therefore there is a certain propriety in its introduction here on the eve of the entry into Canaan. But it must be remembered, on the other hand, that the same thing holds true of very much of the legislation given at Mount Sinai, and avowedly of that comprised in chapter 15 (see verse 2), which yet appears from its position to have been given before the rebellion of Korah in the wilderness. It is indeed plain that the ritual, festal, and sacrificial system, both as elaborated in Leviticus and as supplemented in Numbers, presupposed throughout an almost immediate settlement in Canaan. It is also plain that a system so elaborate, and entailing so much care and expense, could hardly have come into regular use during the conquest, or for some time after. It cannot, therefore, be said with any special force that the present section finds its natural place here. All we can affirm is that the system itself was of Divine origin, and dated in substance from the days of Moses. In any case, therefore, it is rightly introduced with the usual formula which attests that it came from God, and came through Moses. It must be noted that a great variety of observances which were zealously followed by the Jews of later ages find no place here. Compare, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the ceremonial pouring of water during the feast of tabernacles, to which allusion is made by the prophet Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>) and our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37, 38</a>).

The former would seem to be the real meaning of the original. There is nowhere any specific direction as to the ritual of the drink offering (see on Leviticus 23, and <a href="../../par/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), nor is it certain whether it was poured at the foot of the altar (as apparently stated in Ecclus. 1. 15) or poured upon the flesh of the sacrifice on the altar (as seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The strong wine.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The Targums render it "old wine," because the drink offering was in every other instance ordered to be made with wine (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, &c.). <span class="accented">Shecar</span>, however, was not wine, but strong drink other than wine (such as we call "spirits"), and it is invariably used in that sense in contradistinction to wine (see on Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3, &c.). It can only be supposed that the difficulty of procuring wine in the wilderness had caused the coarser and commoner liquor to be substituted for it. It is certainly remarkable that the mention of <span class="accented">shecar</span> should be retained at a time when wine must have been easily obtainable, and was about to become abundant (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). As it would seem impossible that <span class="accented">shecar</span> should have been substituted for wine after the settlement in Canaan, its mention here may be accepted as evidence of the wilderness-origin of this particular ordinance. The quantity ordained (about a quart for each lamb) was very considerable.

There can be no doubt that this (unlike the sabbath) was a nature-festival, observed more or less by all nations. As such it did not require to be instituted, but only to be regulated and sanctified in order that it might not lend itself to idolatry, as it did among the heathen (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>). The new-moon feast, depending upon no calendar but that of the sky, and more clearly marked in that than any other recurring period, was certain to fix itself deeply in the social and religious habits of a simple pastoral or agricultural people. Accordingly we find it incidentally mentioned as a day of social gathering (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a>), and as a day for religious instruction (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>). From the latter passage, and from such passages as <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, it is evident that the feast of the new moon became to the month exactly what the sabbath was to the week - a day of rest and of worship (see also Judith 8:6).

The fact that no notice is taken of the sacrifice already ordered would seem to point to the former conclusion; but the further fact that no mention is made of the offering of wave-loaves, with which the sacrifices in Leviticus were distinctively connected, seems to show that the two lists were independent (cf. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:10, 6). The fact seems to be that throughout this section no sacrifices are mentioned save such as formed a part of the system which is here for the first time elaborated.

According to Aben Ezra and other Jewish expositors, the device upon the standard of Judah was a young lion, and this agrees with <a href="../../par/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>. The same authorities assign to Reuben a man, to Ephraim an ox (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), to Dan an eagle. If it were so, we should find in these banners the origin of the forms of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel and St. John (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4-6</a>), unless, indeed, the devices on the standards were themselves taken from the symbolic forms of the cherubim in the tabernacle, and these in their turn borrowed from the religious art of Egypt. But the tradition of the Jews is too fluctuating to carry any weight. The Targum of Palestine assigns to Judea the lion, but to Reuben a stag, to Ephraim a young man, and to Dan a basilisk serpent.

Modern writers, starting from some measurements of the Roman camps given by Polybius, compute the necessary space at three or three and a half miles square. This would require the strictest discipline and economy of space, and makes no provision for cattle; but supposing that the women and children were closely packed, it might suffice. It is, however, evident that there would be very few places in the wilderness, if any, where more than three square miles of fairly level ground could be found. In the plains of Moab the desired room might perhaps have been found, but scarcely anywhere in the wilderness of Paran. We must conclude, therefore, that this order of encampment was an ideal order, beautiful indeed by reason of its faultless regularity and equality, but only to be attained in practice as circumstances should permit, more or less. Indeed, that the foursquare symmetry of the camp had an ideal meaning and significance more really, because more permanently, important than its actual realization at the time, is evident from its recurrence again and again in the Apocalyptic writings (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>, and especially <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). It is impossible to help seeing that the description of the heavenly Zion is that of a city, but of a city modeled upon the pattern of the camp in the wilderness. Here is one of those cases in which the spiritual significance of an order is of such importance that it matters comparatively little whether it <span class="accented">could</span> be literally carried out or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/30.htm"><title>Numbers 30 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/30.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/30.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/30-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/29.htm" title="Numbers 29">&#9668;</a> Numbers 30 <a href="../numbers/31.htm" title="Numbers 31">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/30-1.htm">Numbers 30:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD hath commanded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes.</span> The regulations here laid down about vows follow with a certain propriety upon those concerning the ordinary routine of sacrifices (see verse 39 of last chapter), but we cannot conclude with any assurance that they were actually given at this particular period. It would appear upon the lace of it that we have in <a href="../../par/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, and in this chapter two fragments of Mosaic legislation dealing with the same subject, but, for some reason which it is useless to attempt to discover, widely separated in the inspired record. Nor does there seem to be any valid reason for explaining away the apparently fragmentary and dislocated character of these two sections (see the Introduction). The statement, peculiar to this passage, that these instructions were issued to the "heads of the tribes" itself serves to differentiate it from all the rest of the "statutes" given by Moses, and suggests that this chapter was inserted either by some other hand or from a  different source. There is no reason whatever for supposing that the "heads of the tribes" were more interested in these particular regulations than in many others which concerned the social life of the people (such as that treated of in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-5.htm">Numbers 5:5-31</a>) which were declared in the ordinary way unto "the children of Israel" at large.

This, however, cannot be strictly maintained, because the Nazarite vow was <span class="accented">neder</span>, and that was essentially a vow of abstinence. To say that the vow of the Nazarite was of a positive character because he had to let his hair grow "unto the Lord" is a mere evasion. It is, however, probable that <span class="accented">neder</span>, when it occurs (as in this passage) in connection with <span class="accented">issar</span>, does take on the narrower signification of a positive vow. <span class="cmt_word">Swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond.</span> Literally, "to bind a bond upon his soul." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, a bond, which occurs only in this chapter, is considered to be a restrictive obligation, a vow of abstinence. It would appear that the <span class="accented">issar</span> was always undertaken upon oath, whereas the <span class="accented">neder</span> (as in the case of the Nazarite) did not of necessity require it. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall not break his word.</span> This was the general principle with respect to vows, and, as here ]aid down, it was in accordance with the universal religious feeling of mankind. Whatever crimes may have claimed the sanction of this sentiment, whatever exceptions and safeguards a clearer revelation and a better knowledge of God may have established, yet the principle remained that whatsoever a man had promised unto the Lord, that he must fulfill. Iphigenia in Aulis, Jephthah's daughter in Gilead, proclaim to what horrid extremities any one religious principle, unchecked by other coordinate principles, may lead; but they also proclaim how deep and true this religious principle must have been which could so over-ride the natural feelings of men not cruel nor depraved.

Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">she vowed.</span> Rather, "and her vows be upon her."

The vows might have been made before her betrothal, and not disallowed by her father; yet upon her coming under the power of her husband he had an absolute right to dissolve the obligation of them; otherwise it is evident that he might suffer loss through an act of which he had no notice. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span> <span class="cmt_word">uttered ought out of her lips.</span> Rather, "or the rash utterance of her lips."

Possibly the interval had been purposely allowed in order that the attack when it was made might be sudden and unexpected. From the fact that no resistance would seem to have been made to the Israelitish detachment, and that an enormous amount of plunder was secured, we may probably conclude that the Midianites had thought all danger past.

On the grave moral question which arises out of this war, and of the manner in which it was carried on, see the note at the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.</span> It is quite possible that Moses himself had been reluctant to order the expedition against Midian, either because it involved so much bloodshed, or, more probably, because he foresaw the difficulty which actually arose about the women of Midian. If so, he was here reminded that his place was to obey, and that his work on earth was not done so long as the Midianites remained unpunished.

In seducing the people of the Lord the Midianites had insulted and injured the majesty of God himself. On the question why Midian only, and not Moab also, was punished see on Numbers 25:17. It is to be remembered that, however hateful the sins of licentiousness and idolatry may be, they have never aroused by themselves the exterminating wrath of God. Midian was smitten because he had deliberately used these sins as weapons wherewith to take the life of Israel.

In after times the Messiah Milchama ("Sacerdos unctus ad bellum," alluded to in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-2.htm">Deuteronomy 20:2</a>) who accompanied the army to the field was a recognized member of the Jewish hierarchy.

It is difficult to understand what "holy vessels" could have accompanied an expedition of this sort, unless it were the ark itself. The Israelites were accustomed at all critical times to be preceded by the ark (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a>), and the narrative of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a> sq. shows plainly that, long after the settlement at Shiloh, no scruples existed against bringing it forth against the foes of Israel and of God. Indeed there is a resemblance in the circumstances between that ease and this which is all the more striking because of the contrast in the result. Most modern commentators, unwilling to believe that the ark left the camp (but cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), identify the "holy instruments" with "the trumpets;" this, however, is plainly to do violence to the grammar, which is perfectly simple, and is contrary to the Septuagint and the Targums. The Targum of Palestine paraphrases "holy instruments" by Urim and Thummim; these, however, as far as we can gather, seem to have been in the exclusive possession of the high priest.

From this it has been concluded by some that the Midianites at this time destroyed included only certain tribes which had settled down within the territory afterwards assigned to Reuben, and had become tributary to Sihon.

It will be best first to state the proceedings in all their ugliness; then to reject the false excuses made for them; and lastly, to justify (if possible) the Divine sanction accorded to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> That the Midianites had injured Israel is clear; as also that they had done so  deliberately, craftily, and successfully, under the advice of Balaam. They had so acted as if <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, a modern nation were to pour its opium into the ports of a dreaded neighbour in time of peace, not simply for the sake of gain (which is base enough), but with deliberate intent to ruin the morals and destroy the manhood of the nation. Such a course of action, if proved, would be held to justify any reprisals possible within the limits of legitimate war; Christian nations have avenged far less weighty injuries by bloody wars in this very century. Midian, therefore, was attacked by a detachment of the Israelites, and for some reason seems to have been unable either to fight or to fly. Thereupon all the men (i.e., all who bore arms) were slain; the towns and hamlets were destroyed; the women, children, and cattle driven off as booty. So far the Israelites had but followed the ordinary customs of war, with this great exception in their favour, that they offered (as is evident from the narrative) no violence to the women. Upon their return to the camp Moses was greatly displeased at the fact of the Midianitish women having been brought in, and gave orders that all the male children and all the women who were not virgins were to be slain. The inspection necessary to determine the latter point was left presumably to the soldiers. The Targum of Palestine indeed inserts a fable concerning some miraculous, or rather magical, test which was used to decide the question in each individual case. But this is simply a fable invented to avoid a disagreeable conclusion; both soldiers and captives were unclean, and were kept apart; and the narrative clearly implies that there was no communication between them and the people at large until long after the slaughter was over. To put the matter boldly, we have to face the fact that, under Moses' directions, 12,000 soldiers had to deal with perhaps 50,000 women, first by ascertaining that they were not <span class="accented">virgins</span>, and then by killing them in cold blood. It is a small additional horror that a multitude of infants must have perished directly or indirectly with their mothers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> It is commonly urged in vindication of this massacre that the war was God's war, and that God had a perfect right to exterminate a most guilty people. This is true in a sense. If God had been pleased to visit the Midianites with pestilence, famine, or hordes of savages worse than themselves, no one would have charged him with injustice. All who believe in an over-ruling Providence believe that in one way or other God has provided that great wickedness in a nation shall be greatly punished. But that is beside the question altogether; the difficulty is, not that the Midianites were exterminated, but that they were exterminated in an inhuman manner by the Israelites. If they had been so many swine the work would have been revolting; being men, women, and children, with all the ineffaceable beauty, interest, and hope of our common humanity upon them, the very soul sickens to think upon the cruel details of their slaughter. An ordinarily good man, sharing the feelings which do honour to the present century, would certainly have flung down his sword and braved all wrath human or Divine, rather than go on with so hateful a work; and there is not surely any Christian teacher who would not say that he acted quite rightly; if such orders proceeded from God's undoubted representative today, it would be necessary deliberately to disobey them. It is urged again that the question at issue really was, "whether an obscene and debasing idolatry should undermine the foundations of human society," or whether an awful judgment should at once stamp out the sinners, and brand the sin for ever. But no such question was at issue. There were obscene and debasing idolatries in abundance round about Israel, but no effort was made to exterminate them; the Moabites in particular seem to have been just as licentious as the Midianites at this time (see <a href="../../par/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>), and certainly were quite as idolatrous, and yet they were passed  by. Indeed the argument shows an entire failure, so to speak, in moral perspective. Harlotry and idolatry are great sins, but there is no reason to believe that God deals with them otherwise than he does with other sins. It was no part of the Divine intention concerning Israel that he should go about as a knight-errant avenging "obscene idolatries." Many a nation just as immoral as Midian rose to greatness, and displayed some valuable virtues, and (it is to be presumed) did some good work in God's world in preparation for the fullness of time. Harlotry and idolatry prevail to a frightful extent in Great Britain; but any attempt to pursue them with pains and penalties would be scorned by the conscience of the nation as Pharisaical. The fact is (and it is so obvious that it ought not to have been overlooked) that Midian was overthrown, not because he was given over to an "obscene idolatry," wherein he was probably neither much better nor much worse than his neighbours; but because he had made an unprovoked, crafty, and successful attack upon God's people, and had brought thousands of them to a shameful death. The motive which prompted the attack upon them was not horror of their sins, nor fear of their contamination, but vengeance; Midian was smitten avowedly "to avenge the children of Israel" (verse 2) who had fallen through Baal-peor, and at the same time "to avenge the Lord" (verse 3), who had been obliged to slay his own people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">III.</span> The true justification of these proceedings - which we should now call, and justly call, atrocities - divides itself into two parts. In the first place, we have to deal only with the fact that an expedition was sent by Divine command, to smite the Midianites. Now, this does indeed open up a very difficult moral question, but it does not involve any special difficulty of its own. It is certain that wars of revenge were freely sanctioned under the Old Testament dispensation (see on Exodus 17:14-16; 1 Samuel 15:2, 3). It is practically conceded that they are permitted by the New Testament dispensation. At any rate Christian nations habitually wage wars of revenge even against half-armed savages, and many of those who counsel or carry on such wars are men of really religious character. It is possible that if the principles of the New Testament take a deeper hold upon the national conscience, all such wars will be regarded as crimes. This means simply, that in regard to war the moral sentiment of religious people has changed, and is changing very materially from age to age. Even a bad man will shrink from doing today what a good man would have done without the least scruple some centuries ago; and (if the world last) a bad man will be able sincerely to denounce some centuries hence what a good man can bring himself to do with a clear conscience today. Now it has been pointed out again and again that when God assumed the Jews to be his peculiar people, he assumed them not only in the social and political stage, but in the moral stage also, which belonged to their place in the world and in history. Just as God adopted, as King of Israel, the social and political ideas which then prevailed, and made the best of them; in like manner he adopted the moral ideas then current, and made the best of them, so restraining them in one direction, and so enforcing them in another, and so bringing them all under the influence of religious sanctions, as to prepare the way for the bringing in of a higher morality. What God did for the Jews was not to teach them the precepts of a lofty and perfect morality, which was indeed only possible in connection with the revelation of his Son, but to teach them to act in all things from religious motives, and with direct reference to his good pleasure. Accordingly God himself, especially in the earlier part of their history as a nation, undertook to guide their vengeance, and taught them to look upon wars of vengeance (since their conscience freely sanctioned them) as waged for his honour and glory, not their own. If this seem to any one unworthy of the Divine Beings let him  consider for a moment, that on no other condition was the Old Testament dispensation possible. If God was to be the Head of a nation among nations, he must regulate all its affairs, personal, social, and national. We escape the difficulty, and wage wars of vengeance, and commit other acts of doubtful morality, without compromising our religion, because our religion is strictly personal, and our wars are strictly national. But the Old Testament dispensation was emphatically temporal and national; all responsibility for all public acts devolved upon the King of Israel himself. It was absolutely necessary, then, either that God should reveal Christian morality without Christ (which is as though one should have heat without the sun, or a poem without a poet); or that he should sanction the morality then current in its best form, and teach men to walk bravely and devoutly according to the light of their own conscience. That light was dim enough in some ways, but it was slowly growing clearer through the gradual revelation which God made of himself; and even now it is growing clearer, and still while religion remains fundamentally the same, morality is distinctly advancing, and good people are learning to abhor today what they did in the faith and fear of God but yesterday. Take, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that saying, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." For the Jew it meant that in waging wars of vengeance he fought as the Lord's soldier and not as in a private quarrel. For the Christian of the present day it means that revenge of private injuries is to be left altogether to the just judgment of the last day. To the Christian of some future age it will mean that all revenge for injuries and humiliations, private or public, individual or national, must be left to the justice of him who ordereth all things in this world or the world to come. Each has a different standard of morality; yet each, even in doing what another will abhor, may claim the Divine sanction, for each acts truly and religiously according to his lights. This being so, it is only necessary further to point out that the slaying of all the men whom they could get at was the ordinary custom of war in those days, when no distinction could be drawn between combatants and non-combatants. The practice of war in this respect is entirely determined by the sentiment of the age, and is always in the nature of a compromise between the desire to kill and the desire to spare. As these two desires can never be reconciled, they divide the field between them with a curious inconsistency. The first is satisfied by the ever-increasing destructiveness of war; the second is gratified by the alleviations which strict discipline and skilled assistance can procure for the vanquished and the wounded. Whether ancient or modern wars really left the larger tale of misery behind them is a matter of great doubt; but at any rate the custom of war sanctioned the slaughter of all the combatants, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of all the men, at that time; and if war is to be waged at all, it must be allowed to follow the ordinary practice. In the second place, however, we have to deal with horrors of an exceptional character, in the subsequent slaughter of the women and boys. Now it is to be observed that the orders for this slaughter proceeded from Moses alone. According to the narrative of verse 13 sq., Moses went out of the camp, and on perceiving the state of the case, gave instructions at once while his anger was hot. It is possible that he sought for Divine guidance, but it does not appear that he did, but rather that he acted upon his own judgment, and under the ordinary guidance of his own conscience. We have not, therefore, to face the difficulty of a direct command from God, but only the difficulty of a holy man, full of heavenly wisdom, having ordered a butchery so abhorrent to our modern feelings. Let it then in all fairness be observed - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Moses was not responsible for the presence of these captives. They ought either to have been killed, or left in their own land; it was either the  cupidity or the mistaken pity of the soldiers which brought them there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That Moses could not tolerate their presence in the host. It seems a vile thing to kill a woman, but it was the women more than the men of Midian of whom they bad just reason to be afraid. In justice to the men, in fairness to the wives, of Israel, it was simply impossible to let them loose upon the camp. Again, it seems cowardly to slay a helpless child; yet to suffer a generation of Midianites to grow up under the roofs of Israel would have been madness and worse, for it would have been to court a great and perhaps fatal national disaster. For the sake of Israel the captive women and children must be got rid of, and this could only be done either by slaughtering the women and boys, or by taking them back to their desolated homes to perish of hunger and disease. Of the two courses Moses certainly chose the more merciful. The nation was exterminated; the girls only were spared because they were harmless then, and likely to remain harmless; distributed through the households of Israel, without parents or brothers to keep alive the national sentiment, they would rapidly be absorbed in the people of the Lord; within a few weeks these girls of Midian would be happier, and certainly their future prospects would be brighter, than if they had remained unmolested at home. The charge, therefore, which remains against Moses is, that he ordered the slaughter in cold blood of many thousands of women and children, not unnecessarily nor wantonly, but for reasons which were in themselves very weighty. It is of course an axiom of modern times that we do not wage war against women and children. But this, while partly due to Christian feeling, is partly due to the conviction that they are not formidable. If in any war the women of the enemy habitually attempted to poison, and often did poison, our soldiers, they would probably meet with scant mercy. In blockading a fortified city a modern army deliberately starves to death a great many women and children; and if they seek to escape they are sent back to starve, and to induce the garrison to surrender by the spectacle of their sufferings. If this is justified (as no doubt it is if war is to be prosecuted at all) by the plea of necessity, Moses' plea of necessity must be heard also. He deliberately thought it better that these women and boys should be slaughtered than that the future of Israel should be gravely imperiled. In these days, indeed, he would be wrong in coming to that conclusion, and his name would be justly branded with infamy. It would be unquestionably better to incur any loss, rather than outrage in so violent a manner the Christian sentiment of pity and tenderness towards the young, the innocent, the helpless; it would be better to run any risk than to brutalize the soldiery by the execution of such an order. So slowly do sentiments of mercy establish themselves in the hearts of mankind, and so unspeakably valuable are they when established, that he would be a traitor against humanity and against God who should on any pretence outrage any one of them. But there was no such sentiment to outrage in the time of Moses; none thought it wrong to slay captive women and children if any necessity demanded their lives. It was an axiom of war that a captive belonged absolutely to his captor, and might be put to death, or sold as a slave, or held to ransom, as pleased him best, without any scruple of conscience. Moses, therefore sharing as he certainly did the sentiments of his age, was morally free to act for the best, without any thought whether it was cruel or not; and God did not interfere with his decision because it was cruel, any more than he did with the similar decision of other good men who warred, and slew, and spared not before the coming of Christ, and indeed since that coming too. Finally, if the method of separation was odious, it was still the only way possible under the circumstances of separating the harmless from the harmful, and of clearing mercy towards the captives from danger to the  captors. And here again a proceeding could be sanctioned without sin then which perhaps no necessity could excuse now, because the sentiment of modesty which it would violate did not exist then, or rather did not exist in the same form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/30.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 30"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 30" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/32.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 32"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 32" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/32.htm"><title>Numbers 32 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/32.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/32.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/32-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/31.htm" title="Numbers 31">&#9668;</a> Numbers 32 <a href="../numbers/33.htm" title="Numbers 33">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place <i>was</i> a place for cattle;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Reuben and the children of Gad.</span> Reuben and Gad had both been camped on the same (southern) side of the tabernacle, but had not apparently been neighbours, since Simeon intervened on the march (see on Numbers 2:10-14). Simeon, however, was at this time enfeebled and disgraced, and was not likely to assert himself in any way. The "great multitude of cattle" belonging to the two tribes probably point to pastoral habits of long standing, since the cattle of the Amorites and Midianites would be equally divided among all. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Jazer.</span> Jazer, or Jaazer, probably stood near the northern source of the Wady Hesban, which enters the Jordan not far from its mouth. The "land of Jazer" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, "all the cities of the Mishor"). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead.</span> Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>); but more properly it denoted the  lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name "Mount Gilead" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8, 9</a>) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">place for cattle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>), and is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> in verse 4.

They all lie to the south of Gilead, properly so called, within a comparatively short distance of the route by which the main body of the Israelites had advanced. Probably the cattle which followed the host were still grazing under guard around these places, and it was very natural that tribes which had hitherto lived closely crowded together should not at first contemplate spreading themselves very far afield.

If they thought at all of the effect of their request upon their brethren, it is quite likely that they intended to do them a kindness by leaving them more room on the other side Jordan; and indeed Canaan proper was all too strait for such a population. Whether they were <span class="accented">wise</span> in wishing to stay in the wider and more attractive lands which they had seen is another matter. They knew that the God of Israel had designed to plant his people between Jordan and the sea, and they certainly risked a partial severance from his promises and his protection by remaining where they did. The subsequent history of the trans-Jordanic tribes is a melancholy commentary on the real unwisdom of their choice. Yet it would have been difficult for them to know that they were wrong, except by an instinct of faith which no Israelites perhaps at that time possessed.

Once already the faith and courage of the people had failed them on the very threshold of the promised land, and a slight discouragement might bring about a similar calamity. Hence he spoke with a degree of sharpness which does not appear to have been deserved.

In Deuteronomy it occurs four times, and "Kadesh" twice. In Joshua "Kadesh-Barnea" occurs exclusively. In the later books "Kadesh" only is used, as in Genesis and in the previous chapters of Numbers.

In later ages, no doubt, it came to mean simply the trans-Jordanic territory, or Peraea, without reference to the position of the speaker. The difficulty here is to decide whether the expression, as further defined by "eastward," would actually have been used at that time and in that place, or whether the expression is due to a writer living on the west of Jordan. All we can say is, that the awkward use of the phrase in two opposite meanings, with words of clearer definition added, points more or less strongly towards a probability that the passage as it stands was written or revised at a later date.

That the tribe was divided at all can only be explained by the pre-existence of some schism in its ranks, the probable origin and nature of which are discussed in the notes on verses 39, 41. The enormous increase in the tribal numbers during the wanderings (see on chapter Numbers 26:34) may have made the division more advisable, and the adventurous and independent character of the Machirites may have rendered it almost a necessity. They had not apparently preferred any request to Moses, but since the trans-Jordanic territory was to be occupied, Moses probably prevented a grave difficulty by recognizing their claim to the conquests they had made.

He was indeed compensated with the southern settlements of the Gadites as far as the Wady Hesban, but even so his limits were very straitened as compared with those of Gad and of half Manasseh.

In the absence of any direct information, we can only guess at the nature of the tie which united the Beni-Machir as a family, and kept them distinct from the other Manassite families. It is evident from their history that they formed a sub-tribe powerful enough to have a name of their own in Israel (cf. verse 40 and <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>, and see note on verse 41). <span class="cmt_word">Went to Gilead.</span> This would seem to refer to the expedition briefly recorded in chapter Numbers 21:33. It is mentioned here out of place, in the simple historical style of the Pentateuch, because the gift of Gilead to Machir grew out of its conquest by Machir.

His father Hezron, according to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>, married the daughter of Manasseh in his old age, when his elder sons were probably already fathers of families. It may probably be conjectured also that Manasseh, who must have inherited exceptional wealth (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>), and had but one grandson, left a large portion to his grand-daughter, the young wife of Hezron. It was therefore very natural that Segub should have attached himself to the fortunes of his mother's tribe. Is it not also very probable that Machir had other daughters (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>), who also inherited large portions from their grandfather, and whose husbands were willing enough to enter into a family which had apparently brighter prospects than any others? If so, it would account at once for the existence of a large family of Machirites not descended from  Gilead, and not on the most friendly terms with the rest of the tribe. It is quite possible that many of the more adventurous spirits amongst the tribe of Judah joined themselves to a family whose reputation and exploits they might naturally claim as their own (see on Joshua 19:34). <span class="cmt_word">The small towns thereof,</span> or, "their villages." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, i.e. the hamlets of the Amorites who dwelt in Argob (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), the modern district of el Lejja, on the north-western waters of the Yermuk or Hieromax. <span class="cmt_word">And called them Havoth-jair.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>.

There does not, however, seem to be anything except the very doubtful analogy of certain German names in favour of the rendering "Jair's lives." It is more likely the corruption of some more ancient name. There is some discrepancy in subsequent references to the Chavvoth-jair. According to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, Jair had twenty-three towns in Gilead; from <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> it appears that the sons of the later Jair had thirty cities "in the land of Gilead" which went under the name of Chavvoth-jair; while in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> "all the Chavvoth-jair which are in Bashan" are reckoned at sixty. The plausible, though not wholly satisfactory, explanation is, that the conquests of Nobah came to be subsequently included in those of his more famous contemporary, and the vague name of Chavvoth-jair extended to all the towns in that part of Gilead, and of Bashan too (see notes on the passages cited). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a></div><div class="verse">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nobah.</span> As this chieftain is nowhere else named, we may probably conclude that he was one of the companions of Jair, holding a position more or less subordinate to him. <span class="cmt_word">Kenath</span>. The modern Kenawat, on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, the most easterly point ever occupied by the Israelites. It is apparently the Nobah mentioned in <a href="../../par/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, but it has reverted (like so many others) to its old name. In spite of the uncertainties which hang over the conquest of this north-eastern territory, there is something very characteristic in the part played by the Machirite leaders. That they acted with an independent vigour bordering on audacity, that they showed great personal prowess, and had great personal authority with the humbler members of their family, and held something like the position of feudal superiors among them, is evident from the way in which they are spoken cf. And this is quite in keeping with the character of the Manassites in after times. The "governors" who came at the call of Barak, Gideon, the greatest of the warrior-judges, and probably Jephthah also ("the Gileadite"), as well as the younger Jail maintained the warlike and impetuous character of their race. If "Elijah the Tishbite" was really from this region (although this is extremely doubtful), we should find in him the characteristic daring and self-reliance of Machir transmuted into their spiritual equivalents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/33.htm"><title>Numbers 33 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/33.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/33.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/33-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/32.htm" title="Numbers 32">&#9668;</a> Numbers 33 <a href="../numbers/34.htm" title="Numbers 34">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/33-1.htm">Numbers 33:1</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>are</i> the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the journeys.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> by the Septuagint, which means "stages" or "stations."

It is more natural to read it with the verb "wrote;" and in that case we have a direct assertion that Moses wrote this list of marches himself by command of God, doubtless as a memorial not only of historical interest, but of deep religious significance, as showing how Israel had been led by him who is faithful and true faithful in keeping his promise, true in fulfilling his word for good or for evil. The direct statement that Moses wrote this list himself is strongly corroborated by internal evidence, and has been accepted as substantially true by the most destructive critics. No conceivable inducement could have existed to invent a list of marches which only partially corresponds with the historical account, and can only with difficulty be reconciled with it - a list which contains many names nowhere else occurring, and having no associations for the later Israelites. Whether the statement thus introduced tells in favour of the Mosaic authorship (as usually accepted) of the rest of the Book is a very different matter, on which see the Introduction.

The fact that the Egyptians were so universally employed about the funeral rites of their first-born - rites to which they paid such extreme attention - seems to be mentioned here as supplying one reason at least why the Israelites began their outward march without opposition. It is in perfect accordance with what we know of the Egyptians, that all other passions and interests should give place for the time to the necessary care for the departed. <span class="cmt_word">Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.</span> See on Exodus 12:12, and cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.

There are two difficulties in the way of this identification. In the first place we should then only have three names of stations between Sinai and the southern border of Palestine, on what is at least eleven days' journey. This is, however, confessedly the case in the historical narrative, and it admits of explanation. We know that the first journey was a three days' journey (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>), and the others may have been longer still, through a country which presented no facilities for encamping, and possessed no variety of natural features. In the second place, Rithmah is not Kadesh, and cannot be connected with Kadesh except through a doubtful identification with the Wady Retemat in the neighbourhood of Ain Kudes (see note at end of chapter 13). It is, however, evident from <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, as compared with <a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>, that Kadesh was not the name originally given to the encampment "in the wilderness of Paran." It seems to have got that name - perhaps owing to some popular feeling with respect to an ancient sanctuary, perhaps owing to some partial shifting of the camp - during the absence of the spies. Rithmah, therefore, may well have been the official name (so to speak) originally given to the encampment, but subsequently superseded by the more famous name of Kadesh; this would explain both its non-appearance in the narrative of Numbers, and its appearance in the Itinerary here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/33-19.htm">Numbers 33:19</a></div><div class="verse">And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rimmon-parez.</span> The latter part of the name is the same as <span class="accented">parats</span> or <span class="accented">perets</span>, which commonly signifies a breaking out of . Divine anger. This place may possibly have been the scene of the events related in chapters 16, 17, but the Targum of Palestine connects them with Kehelathah.

So many places, however, in that region are distinguished by the dazzling whiteness of their limestone cliffs that the identification is quite uncertain. The site of this, as of the next eight stations, is indeed utterly unknown; and the guesses which are founded on the partial and probably accidental similarity of some modern names (themselves differently pronounced by different travelers) are utterly worthless. Of these eight names, Kehelathah and Makheloth seem to be derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>, "an assembling," and thus give some slight support to the supposition that during the thirty-eight years the people were scattered abroad, and only assembled from time to time in one place. Rissah is variously interpreted "heap of ruins," or "dew;" Shapher means "fair," or "splendid;" Haradah, or Charadah, is "terror," or "trembling" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>); Tahath is a "going down," or "depression;" Tarah is "turning," or "delay;" Mithcah signifies "sweetness," and may be compared (in an opposite sense) to Marah.

At this later date it was at the head of the navigable waters of the Elanitic Gulf, but considerable changes have taken place in the shore line since the age of Solomon, and no doubt similar changes took place before. It was known to, and at times occupied by, the Egyptians, and the wretched village which occupies the site is still called Aszium by the  Arabs.

It formed the boundary of Sihon's kingdom at the south-west corner. Abel-shittim, "meadow of acacias," is better known by the abbreviated name "Shittim" (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5</a>). Its exact site cannot be recovered, but the Talmud states that it was twelve miles north of the Jordan mouth. Probably the center of the camp was opposite to the great fords, and the road leading to Jericho.  <span class="ref_word">NOTE ON THE TWO LISTS OF STATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND THE JORDAN.</span> There can be no question that the chief interest of the Itinerary here given is due to its literary character as a document containing elements at least of extreme and unquestioned antiquity. At the same time it is a matter of some importance to compare it with the history as given at large in Exodus and Numbers, and to note carefully the points of contact and divergence. It is evident at first sight that no pains have been taken to make the two lists of stages agree, each list containing several names which the other lacks, and (in some cases) each having a name of its own for what appears to be the same place. With respect to the latter point, the explanation usually given seems quite natural and satisfactory: the names were in many cases given by the Israelites themselves, and in others were derived from some small local peculiarity, or belonged to insignificant hamlets, so that the same encampment may very well have received one name in the official record of the movements of the tabernacle, and retained another in the popular recollection of the march. With respect to the former point, it may fairly be argued that the narrative only records as a rule the names of places where something memorable occurred, and indeed does not always mention the place even then, while the Itinerary is simply concerned with the consecutive encampments as such. It would be more correct to say that the narrative is essentially fragmentary, and does not purport to record more than certain incidents of the wanderings. We have, therefore, no difficulty in understanding why the Itinerary gives us the names of three stations between Egypt and Mount Sinai not mentioned in Exodus. There is much more difficulty with the ensuing notices, because the name of Kadesh only occurs once in the list, whereas it is absolutely necessary, in order to bring the narrative into any chronological sequence, to assume (what the narrative itself pretty clearly intimates) that there were two encampments at Kadesh, separated by an interval of more than thirty-eight years. It has accordingly been very generally agreed that the Rithmah of the Itinerary is identical with the nameless station "in the wilderness of Paran," afterwards called Kadesh in the narrative. This is of course an assumption which has only probabilities to support it, but it may fairly be said that there is nothing against it. The <span class="accented">retem</span>, or broom, is so common that it must have given a name to many different spots - a name too common, and possessing too few associations, to stand its ground in popular remembrance against any rival name (see note on verse 18). It has been argued by some that the whole of the twenty-one stages enumerated in verses 16-35 were made on the one journey from Sinai to Kadesh; and as far as the mere number goes there is nothing improbable in the supposition; the "eleven days" of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a> are no doubt the days of ordinary travelers, not of women and children, flocks and herds. It is true that the supposition is commonly connected with a theory which throws the whole historical narrative into confusion, viz., that Israel spent only two years instead of forty in the wilderness; but that need not cause its <span class="accented">rejection</span>, for the whole thirty-eight may be intercalated between verse 36 and verse 37 of the Itinerary, and we could explain a total silence concerning the wanderings of those years better than we can the mention of (only) seventeen stations. The only serious difficulty is presented by the name Ezion-geber, which it is very difficult not to identify with the place of that name, so well known afterwards, at the head of the Elanitic Gulf; for it is impossible to find the last stage towards Kadesh at a spot as near to Sinai as to any of the supposed sites of Kadesh.  It is of course possible that more than one place was known as the "giant's backbone;" but, on the other hand, the fact that at Moseroth Israel was near Mount Hor, and that they made five marches thence to Ezion-geber, is quite in accordance with the site usually assigned to it. It must remain, therefore, an unsettled point as to which nothing more can be said than that a balance of probabilities is in favour of the identification of Rithmah with the first encampment at Kadesh. Proceeding on this assumption, we have thereafter eleven names of stations concerning which nothing is known, and nothing can be with any profit conjectured. Then come four others which are evidently the same as those mentioned in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6, 7</a>. That this latter passage is a fragment which has come into its present position (humanly speaking) by some accident of transcription does not admit of serious debate; but it is evidently a fragment of some ancient document, possibly of the very Itinerary of which we have only an abbreviation here. Comparing the two, we are met at once with the difficulty that Aaron is said to have died and been buried at Moserah, whereas, according to the narrative and the Itinerary, he died on Mount Hor during the last journey from Kadesh. This is not unnaturally explained by assuming that the official name of the encampment under, or opposite to, Mount Hor, from which Aaron ascended the mountain to die, was Moserah or Moseroth, and that the Israelites were twice encamped there - once on their way to Ezion-geber and back to Kadesh, and again on the last march round Edom, to which the fragment in Deuteronomy refers. There remain, however, unexplained the singular facts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the station where Aaron died is called Moserah in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, whereas it is called Mount Hor not only in the narrative, but in the Itinerary, which nevertheless does give the name Moseroth to this very station when occupied on a previous occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the fragment gives Bene-Jaakan, Moseroth, Gudgod, and Jotbath as stages on the last journey, whereas the Itinerary gives them (the order of the first two being inverted) as stages on a previous journey, and gives other names for the encampments of the last journey. There is no doubt room for all four, and more besides, between Mount Hor and Oboth; but it cannot be denied that there is an appearance of error either in the fragment or in the Itinerary. A further objection has been made to the statement that Israel marched from Ezion-geber to Kadesh, both on the score of distance and of the apparent absurdity of returning to Kadesh only to retrace their steps once more. It is replied <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the return to Kadesh for the final move may have been hurried, and no regular encampment pitched; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that when Israel returned to Kadesh it was still in expectation of entering Canaan "by the way of the spies," and in ignorance that they would have to treat with Edom for a passage - much more that they would have to come down the Arabah once again. Lastly, with respect to the names which occur after Ije-abarim, we have again an almost total want of coincidence with this peculiarity, that the narrative gives seven names where the Itinerary only gives three. It must, however, be remembered that the whole distance from the brook of Arnon, where the Israelites crossed it, to the Arboth Moab is only thirty miles in a straight line. Over this short distance it is quite likely that the armies of Israel moved in lines more or less parallel, the tabernacle probably only shifting its place as the general advance made it desirable. That the two accounts are based on different documents, or drawn from different sources, is likely enough; but both may nevertheless be equally correct. If (as regards the last march) one record was kept by Eleazar, and another by Joshua, the apparent disagreement may be readily explained.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 33:50-34:29

As a fact, it would seem that the Jews, instead of obeying this command, appropriated the Bamoth to their own religious uses (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>, &c.). The natural result was, as in all similar cases, that not only the Bamoth, but very many of the superstitions and idolatries connected with them, were taken over into the service of the Lord.

But while the whole earth was the Lord's, it is clear that he assumed a special relation towards the land of Canaan, as to which he chose to exercise directly the rights and duties of landlord (see on Deuteronomy 22:8 for a small but striking instance). The first duty of a landlord is to see that the occupancy of his property is not abused for illegal or immoral ends; and this duty excuses, because it necessitates, eviction under certain circumstances. It is not, therefore, necessary to argue that the Canaanites were more infamous than many others; it is enough to remember that God had assumed towards the land which they occupied (apparently by conquest) a relation which did not allow him to overlook their enormities, as he might those of other nations (see on Exodus 23:23-33; 34:11-17, and cf. <a href="../../par/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). It was (if we like to put it so) the misfortune of the Canaanites that they alone of "all nations" could not be suffered to "walk in their own ways," because they had settled in a land which the Lord had chosen to administer directly as his own earthly kingdom.

The threat (although in fact fulfilled) does not necessarily involve any prophecy, since to settle down among the remnants of the heathen was a course of action which would obviously and for many reasons commend itself to the Israelites. Indolence and cowardice were consulted by such a policy as much as the natural feelings of pity towards vanquished and apparently harmless foes. The command to extirpate was certainly justified in this case (if it could be in any) by the unhappy consequences of its neglect. Israel being what he was, and so little severed in anything but religion from the ancient heathen, his only chance of future happiness lay in keeping himself from any contact with them. On the morality of the command itself, see on the passages referred to, and on the slaughter of the Midianites. As a fact, the extirpation of the conquered did not offend the moral sense of the Jews then any more than it did that of our heathen Saxon ancestors. Where both races could not dwell in security, it was a matter of course that the weaker was destroyed. Such a command was therefore justified at that time by the end to be attained, because it was not contrary to the moral law as then revealed, or to the moral sense as then educated. Being in itself a lawful proceeding, it was made a religious proceeding, and taken out of the category of selfish violence by being made a direct command of God. </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 32"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 34"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/34.htm"><title>Numbers 34 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/34.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/34.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/34-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/33.htm" title="Numbers 33">&#9668;</a> Numbers 34 <a href="../numbers/35.htm" title="Numbers 35">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm">

The wilderness of gin can scarcely be anything else than the Wady Murreh, with more or less of the barren hills which rise to the south of it, for this wady undoubtedly forms the natural southern boundary of Canaan. All travelers agree both as to the remarkable character of the depression itself and as to the contrast between its northern and southern mountain walls. To the south lies the inhospitable and un-cultivatable desert; to the north the often arid and treeless, but still partially green and habitable, plateau of Southern Palestine. The expression, "on the sides of Edom," can only mean that beyond the Wady Murreh lay territory belonging to Edom, the Mount Seir of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>, the Seir of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; it does not seem possible that Edom proper, which lay to the east of the Arabah, and which barely marched at all with the land of Canaan, should be intended here (see on Joshua 15:1, and the note on the site of Kadesh). <span class="cmt_word">And your south border.</span> This begins a fresh paragraph, in which the southern boundary, already roughly fixed, is described in greater detail. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">the utmost coast of the salt sea eastward.</span> Rather, "shall be from the extremity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) of the salt sea eastward" (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-2.htm">Joshua 15:2</a>).

The A.V., which follows the Septuagint and the Targums, does not seem to give any sense, while the rendering, "to the south side of the ascent," does not seem grammatically defensible. Moreover, it is quite uncertain where the "ascent of Akrabbim," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the "Scorpion-pass," or "Scorpion-stairs," is to be placed. Some travelers have recognized both place and name in a precipitous road which ascends the northern cliffs towards the western end of the Wady Murreh, and which the Arabs call Nakb Kareb; others would make the ascent to be the steep pass of es Sufah, over which runs the road from Petra to Hebron; others, again, identify the Scorpion-stairs with the row of white cliffs which obliquely cross and close in the Ghor, some miles south of the Salt Sea, and separate it from the higher level of the Arabah. None of these identifications are satisfactory, although the first and last have more to be said in their favour than the second. Possibly the ascent of Akrabbim may have been only the Wady Fikreh, along which the natural frontier would run from the point of the Salt Sea into the Wady Murreh. <span class="cmt_word">Pass on to Zin.</span> It is only here and in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> that the name Zin stands by itself; it may have been some place in the broadest part of the Wady Murreh which gave its name to the neighbouring wilderness.

But if Kadesh was in the neighbourhood of the present Ain Kudes, then it may be understood that the frontier, after reaching the western end of the Wady Murreh, made <span class="accented">a detour</span> to the south so as to include Kadesh, as a place of peculiarly sacred memory in the annals of Israel. It is indeed very difficult, with this description of the southern frontier of Canaan before us, to believe that Kadesh was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Arabah, where many commentators place it; for if that were the case, then the boundary line has not yet made any progress at all towards the west, and the only points given on the actual southern boundary are the two unknown places which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Hazar-addar.</span> In <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> this double name is apparently divided into the two names of Hezron and Addar, but possibly the latter only is the place intended here. A Karkaa is also mentioned there, which is equally unknown with the rest.

It was a winter torrent which drained the greater part of the western half of the northern desert of the Sinaitic peninsula. It was, however, only in its lower course, where a single channel receives the intermittent outflow of many wadys, that it was known as the "brook of Egypt," because it formed the well-marked boundary between Egypt and Canaan (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, from the name of the frontier fort, Rhinocorura, afterwards built there). So far as we are able to follow  the line drawn in these verses, it would appear to have held a course somewhat to the south of west for about half its length, then to have made a southerly deflection to Kadesh, and from thence to have struck north-west until it reached the sea, almost in the same latitude as the point from which it started. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>as for</i> the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as for the western border.</span> The Hebrew word for "west" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) is simply that for "sea," because the Jews in their own land always had the sea on their west. Thus the verse reads literally, "And the sea boundary shall be to you the great sea and boundary; this shall be to you the sea boundary." It would seem very unlikely that the Jews familiarly used the word <span class="accented">"yam"</span> for "west" after a residence of several centuries in a country where the sun set not over the sea, but over the desert. Nothing can of course be proved kern the use of the word here, but it cannot be overlooked as one small indication that the language of this passage at any rate is the language of an age subsequent to the conquest of Canaan (see on Exodus 10:19; 26:22, and <a href="../../par/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a>) The line of coast from the brook of Egypt to the Leontes was upwards of 160 miles in length.

Her Ha-har is therefore equivalent to the English "Mount Mountain ;" and just as there are many "Avon rivers" on the English maps, so there were probably many mountains locally known among the Jews as Hor Ha-hat. We do not know what peak this was, although it must have been one clearly distinguishable from the sea. There is, however, no reason whatever for supposing (contrary to the analogy of all such names, and of the other Mount Hor) that it included the whole range of Lebanon proper. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a></div><div class="verse">From mount Hor ye shall point out <i>your border</i> unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath.</span> Literally, "from Mount Hor point out (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, as in the previous verse) to come to Hamath," which seems to mean, "from Mount Hor strike a line for the entrance to Hamath." The real difficulty lies in the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, which the Septuagint renders <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;</span>, "as men enter into Hamath." The same expression occurs in <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, and is similarly rendered by the Septuagint. A comparison with <a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a> and other passages will show that "Ibo Chamath" had a definite geographical meaning as the accepted name of a locality in the extreme north of Canaan. When we come to inquire where "the entrance to Hamath" was, we have nothing to guide us except the natural features of the country. Hamath itself, afterwards Epiphancia on the Orontes, lay far beyond the extremest range of Jewish settlement; nor does it appear that it was ever conquered by the greatest of the Jewish kings. The Hamath in which Solomon built store cities (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), and the Hamath which Jeroboam II. "recovered" for Israel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>), was not the city, but the kingdom (or part of the kingdom), of that name. We do not know how far south the territory of Hamath may have extended, but it is quite likely that it included at times the whole upper valley of the Leontes (now the Litany). The "entrance to Hamath" then must be looked for at some point, distinctly marked by the natural features of the country, where the traveler from Palestine would enter the territory of Hamath. This point has been usually fixed at the pass through which the Orontes breaks out of its upper valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon into the open plain of Hamath. This point, however, is more than sixty miles north of Damascus (which confessedly never belonged to Israel), and nearly a hundred miles north-north-west from Dan. It would require some amount of positive evidence to make it even probable that the whole of the long and narrow valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon, widening towards the north, and separated by mountainous and difficult country from the actual settlements of the Jews, was yet Divinely designated as part of their inheritance. No such positive evidence exists, and therefore we are perfectly free to look for "the entrance to Hamath" much further to the south. It is evident that the ordinary road from the land of Canaan or from the cities of Phoenicia to Hamath must have struck the valley of the Leontes, have ascended that river to its sources, and crossed the watershed to the upper stream of Orontes. The whole of this road, until it reached the pass already spoken of leading down to the Emesa of after days, and so to Hamath, lay through a narrow valley of which the narrowest part is at the southern end of the modern district of el Bekaa, almost in a straight line between Sidon and Mount Hermon. Here the two ranges approach most nearly to the bed of the Litany (Leontes), forming a natural gate by which the traveler to Hamath must needs have entered from the south. Here then, very nearly in lat. 88&deg; 80', we may  reasonably place the "entrance to Hamath" so often spoken of, and so escape the necessity of imagining an artificial and impracticable frontier for the northern boundary of the promised land. Zedad. Identified by some with the present village of Sadad or Sudad, to the south-east of Emesa (Hums); but this identification, which is at best very problematic, is wholly out of the question if the argument of the preceding note be accepted.

Hazar-enan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "fountain court." There are of course many places in and about the Lebanon and anti-Lebanon ranges to which such a name would be suitable, but we have no means of identifying it with any one of them. It must be confessed that this "north border" of Israel is extremely obscure, because we are not told whence it started, nor can we fix, except by conjecture, one single point upon it. A certain amount of light is thrown upon the subject by the description of the tribal boundaries and possessions as given in <a href="../../par/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>, and by the enumeration of places left unconquered in <a href="../../par/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13</a> and <a href="../../par/judges/3.htm">Judges 3</a>. The most northerly of the tribes were Asher and Naphtali, and it does not appear that their allotted territory extended beyond the lower valley of the Leontes where it makes its sharp turn towards the west. It is true that a portion of the tribe of Dan afterwards occupied a district further north, but Dan-Laish itself, which was the extreme of Jewish settlement in this direction, as Beersheba in the other, was southward of Mount Hermon. The passage in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-4.htm">Joshua 13:4-6</a> does indeed go to prove that the Israelites never occupied all their intended territory in this direction, but as far as we can tell the line of promised conquest did not extend further north than alden and Mount Hermon. "All Lebanon toward the sunrising" cannot well mean the whole range from south to north, but all the mountain country lying to the east of Zidon. One other passage promises to throw additional light upon the question, viz., the ideal delimitation of the Holy Land in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47</a>; and here it is true that we find a northern frontier (verses 15-17) apparently far beyond the line of actual settlement, and yet containing two names at least (Zedad and Hazar-enan) which appear in the present list. It is, however, quite uncertain whether the prophet is describing any possible boundary line at all, or whether he is only mentioning(humanly speaking at random)certain points in the far north; his very object would seem to be to picture an enlarged Canaan extending beyond its utmost historical limits. Even if it should be thought that these passages require a frontier further to the north than the one advocated above, it will yet be impossible to carry it to the northern end of the valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon. For in that case the northern frontier will not be a northern frontier at all, but will actually descend from the "entrance of Hamath" in a southerly or south-westerly direction, and distinctly form part of the eastern boundary.

It was not of course true that the territory which they had received lay eastward of Jericho, but it was the case that the tribe leaders had there asked and received permission to occupy that territory, and it was in this direction that the temporary settlements of Reuben and Gad lay, perhaps also those of half Manasseh.

Of these tribe princes (see on Numbers 13:1; Joshua 14:1), Caleb is the only one whose name is known to us, and he had acted in a somewhat similar capacity forty years before. This may of itself account for the tribe of Judah being named first in the list, especially as Reuben was not represented; but the order in which the other names follow is certainly remarkable. Taken in pairs (Judah and Simeon, Manasseh and Ephraim, &c.), they advance regularly from south to north, according to their subsequent position on the map. Differing as this arrangement does so markedly from any previously adopted, it is impossible to suppose that it is accidental. We must conclude either that a coincidence so apparently trivial was Divinely prearranged, or that the arrangement of the names is due to a later hand than that of Moses.

This legislation forms the natural sequel and complement of the Divine decrees already promulgated concerning the Levites. Separated from the rest of the tribes from the time of the first census (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-49.htm">Numbers 1:49</a>), excluded from any tribal inheritance (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>), but endowed with tithes and offerings for their maintenance (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, &c.), it was also necessary that they should be provided with homes for themselves and their cattle. They might indeed have been left to exist as they could, and where they could, upon the provision made for them in the law. But, on the one hand, that provision was itself precarious, depending as it did upon the piety and good feeling of the people (which must often have been found wanting: cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8, 9</a>); and, on the other, it is evident that the Levites were intended, as far as their family and social life was concerned, to share the ordinary comforts and enjoyments of Israelites. Nothing could have been more foreign to the Mosaic ideal than a ministry celibate, ascetic, and detached from this world's wealth, such as readily enough sprang up (whether intended or not) under the teaching of the gospel (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/10-4.htm">Luke 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7, 25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> undoubtedly means here a pasture, or a paddock, an enclosed place outside the town into which the cattle were driven by day to feed. It is possible that the A.V. may have used the word "suburbs" in that sense. To keep cattle to some extent was not only a universal custom, but was well-nigh a necessity of life in that age.

Some have held that the country for 1000 cubits beyond the walls was reserved for pasture (according to verse 4), and for another 1000 cubits for fields and vineyards, so that the Levitical lands extended 2000 cubits in all directions. This is reasonable in itself, since 2000 cubits is only half a mile, and rather more than a square mile of land would not seem too much for pastures, gardens, &c. for a town with at least 1000 inhabitants. The smallest tribe territories seem to have comprised some 300 square miles of country; and if we take the Levitical towns as averaging 1000 cubits square, their forty-eight cities would only give them seventy-three square miles of territory. There is, however, no notice of anything being given to the Levites except their "suburbs," so that this explanation must be at best very doubtful. Others have argued for a plan according to which each outer boundary, drawn at 1000 cubits' distance from the wall, would measure 2000 cubits, plus the length of the town wall; but this is far too artificial, and could only be considered possible as long as it was confined to a paper sketch, for it presupposes that each city lay four-square, and faced the four points of the compass. If the first explanation be untenable, the only alternative sufficiently simple and natural is to suppose that, in order to avoid irregularities of measurement, each outer boundary was to be drawn at an approximate distance of 1000 cubits from the wall, and each of an approximate length of 2000 cubits; at the angles the lines would have to be joined as best they might. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32-34</a> certain regulations are inserted in favour of the Levites. Their houses might be redeemed at any time, and not only within the full year allowed to others; moreover, they returned to them (contrary to the general rule) at the year of Jubilee. Their property in the "suburbs" they could not sell at all, for it was inalienable. It is difficult to believe that these regulations were really made at Mount Sinai, presupposing, as they do, the legislation of this chapter; but if they were actually made at this time, on the eve of the conquest, it is easy to see why they were subsequently inserted in the chapter which deals generally with the powers of sale and redemption. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a></div><div class="verse">And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites <i>there shall be</i> six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">among the cities.</span> Rather, "and the cities." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.

There seems no sufficient reason for supposing that they shared their towns with men of the surrounding tribe. Even if the provision made for their habitation was excessive at first (which does not appear), yet their rate of increase should have been exceptionally high, inasmuch as they were not liable to military service. It is possible that mystical reasons led to the selection of the number forty-eight (12 x 4, both typical of universality), but it is at least equally probable that it was determined by the actual numbers of the tribe. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/35-8.htm">Numbers 35:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the cities which ye shall give <i>shall be</i> of the possession of the children of Israel: from <i>them that have</i> many ye shall give many; but from <i>them that have</i> few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the cities which ye shall give shall be,</span> &c. Rather, "And as to the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall multiply, and from the few ye shall decrease." What seems to be a general rule of proportionate giving is laid down here, but it was not carried out, and it is not easy to see how it could have been. From the large combined territory of Judah and Simeon nine cities were indeed surrendered (<a href="../../par/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>), but all the rest, great and small, gave up four apiece, except Naphtali, which gave up three only. As the territory of Naphtali was apparently large in proportion to its numbers, this was probably for no other reason than that the tribe stood last on the list. Every one. Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. It was in fact each tribe that surrendered so many cities, but since the tribal inheritance was the joint property of all the tribesmen, every man felt that he was a party to the gift. No doubt it was the Divine intention to foster in the tribes as far as possible this local feeling of interest and property in the Levites who dwelt among them (compare the expression "their scribes and Pharisees" in <a href="../../par/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30</a>). The dispersion of the Levites (however mysteriously connected with the prophecy of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>) was obviously designed to form a bond of unity for all Israel by diffusing the knowledge and love of the national religion, and by keeping up a constant communication between the future capital and all the provinces. According to the Divine ideal Israel as a whole was "the election" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) from all the earth, the Levites were the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> of Israel, and the priests the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> of Levi. The priestly family was at present too small to be influential, but the Levites were numerous enough to have leavened the whole nation if they had walked worthy of their calling. They were gathered together in towns of their own, partly no doubt in order to avoid disputes, but partly that they might have a better opportunity of setting forth the true ideal of what Jewish life should be.

The expression there used does not point to more than one "place," but it is not inconsistent with several. Probably the right of sanctuary has been recognized from the earliest times in which any local appropriation of places to sacred purposes has been made. It is an instinct of religion to look upon one who has escaped into a sacred enclosure as being under the personal protection of the presiding deity. It is certain that the right was largely recognized in Egypt, where the priestly caste was so powerful and ambitious; and this is no doubt the reason (humanly speaking) for the promise in <a href="../../par/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, and for the command in the following verse. Inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the Lord's, any places within it might he endowed with rights of sanctuary, but it was obviously suitable that they should be Levitical cities; the Divine prerogative of mercy could nowhere be better exercised, nor would any citizens be better qualified to pronounce and to uphold the rightful decision in each case.

In all other passages (twelve in number) where the word occurs in this sense it is qualified by the addition <span class="accented">"of</span> blood." Standing by itself, it is everywhere else translated "kinsman," or (more properly) "redeemer," and is constantly applied in that sense to God our Saviour (<a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a> &c.). The two ideas, however, which seem to us so distinct, and even so opposed, are in their origin one. To the men of the primitive age, when public justice was not, and when might was right, the only protector was one who could and would avenge them of their wrongs, and by avenging prevent their repetition. This champion of the injured individual, or rather family, - for rights and wrongs were thought of as belonging to families rather than to individuals, was their goel, who had their peace, their safety, above all, their honour, in his charge. For no sentiments spring up quicker, and none exercise a more tyrannous sway, than the sentiment of honour, which in its various and often strangely distorted forms has always perhaps outweighed all other considerations in the minds of men. Now the earliest form in which the sentiment of honour asserted itself was in the blood-feud. If one member of a family was slain, an intolerable shame and sense of contumely  rested upon the family until blood had been avenged by blood, until "satisfaction" had been done by the death of the manslayer. He who freed the family from this intolerable pain and humiliation - who enabled it to hold up its head, and to breathe freely once more - was the goel; and in the natural order of things he was the nearest "kinsman" of the slain who could and would take the duty upon him. To these natural feelings was added in many cases a religious sentiment which regarded homicide as a sin against the higher Powers for which they too demanded the blood of the guilty. Such was the feeling among the Greeks, and probably among the Egyptians, while among the Hebrews it could plead Divine sanction, given in the most comprehensive terms: "Your blood of your lives will I require, at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man;...  whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5, 6</a>). The moral difficulties of this proclamation need not here be considered; it is enough to take note that the Divine law itself recognized the duty as well as the lawfulness of private blood-revenge when public justice could not be depended on. The goel, therefore, was not merely the natural champion of his family, nor only the deliverer who satisfied the imperious demands of an artificial code of honour; he was a minister of God, in whose patient efforts to hunt down his victim the thirst for vengeance was to some extent at least superseded by, or rather transmuted into, the longing to glorify God (compare the difficult case of <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>). It was not merely human feelings of great reach and tenacity which were outraged by the immunity of the manslayer; it was still more the justice of God which received a grievous wound. Just because, however, God had made the cause of the slain man his own, and had sanctioned the avenging mission of the goel, he could therefore regulate the course of vengeance so as to make it run as even as possible with true justice. It was not indeed possible to distinguish <span class="accented">ab initio</span> between the homicide which deserved and that which did not deserve capital punishment. Such distinction, difficult under any circumstances, was impossible when vengeance was in private hands. But while the goel could not be restrained from immediate pursuit unhindered by investigation or compunction (lest his whole usefulness be paralyzed), the manslayer might have opportunity to escape, and to be sheltered under the Divine mercy until he could establish (if that were possible) his innocence. No better instance can be found of the way in which the King of Israel adopted the sentiments and institutions of a semi-barbarous age, added to them the sanctions of religion, and so modified them as to secure the maximum of practical good consistent with the social state and moral feelings of the people. No doubt many an individual was overtaken and slain by the goel who did. not deserve to die according to our ideas; but where perfection was unattainable, this error was far less dangerous to that age than the opposite error of diminishing the sanctity of human life and the awfulness of Divine justice. The congregation. Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. This word is used frequently from <a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a> to the end of this chapter, and again in Joshua and the last two chapters of Judges. It is not found in Deuteronomy, nor often in the later books. In every case apparently <span class="accented">eydah</span> signifies the whole nation as gathered together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, as represented by all who had an acknowledged right to appear, for of course 600,000 men could not gather together in any one place. The force of the word may be understood by reference to its use in <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/21-10.htm">Judges 21:10, 13, 16</a>. Another word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) is also used, less frequently in Leviticus and Numbers, but more frequently in the later books, for the general assembly of the people of Israel. No distinction of meaning can be drawn between the two words, and it cannot, therefore, be maintained that the "congregation" of this verse means the local elders of <a href="../../par/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>. The regulations there laid down are not inconsistent with the present law, but are quite independent of it. They refer to a preliminary hearing of the case as stated by the fugitive alone in order to determine his right to shelter in the mean time; which right, if accorded, was without prejudice to the future judgment of the "congregation" on the whole facts of the case (see below on verse 25).

Those verses, however, seem to be an evident interpolation where they stand, and are hardly consistent with previous statements if taken literally. It is tolerably clear that the two tribes had only formed temporally settlements hitherto, and that their boundaries were not defined as yet; also that the Levitical cities (to which the cities of refuge were to belong) were not separated until after the conquest. It is likely that <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a> is a fragment, the real meaning el which is that Moses ordered the severance of three cities on that side Jordan as cities of refuge, for which purposes the three cities mentioned were afterwards selected.

It is not easy to see why the death of the high priest should have set the fugitive free from the law of vengeance, except as foreshadowing the death of Christ. No similar significance is anywhere else attributed to the death of the high priest; and it was rather in its unbroken continuance than in its recurring interruption that the priesthood of Aaron typified that of the Redeemer. To see anything of a vicarious or satisfactory character in the death of the high priest seems to be introducing an element quite foreign to the symbolism of the Old Testament. The stress, however, which is laid upon the fact of his decease (cf. verse 28), and the solemn notice of his having been anointed with the holy oil, seem to point unmistakably to something in his official and consecrated character which made it right that the rigour of the law should die with him. What the Jubilee was to the debtor who had lost his property, that the death of the high priest was to the homicide who had lost his liberty. If it was the case, as commonly believed, that all blood feuds were absolutely terminated by the death of the high priest, might this not be because the high priest, as chief minister of the law of God, was himself the goel of the whole nation? When he died all processes of' vengeance lapsed, because they had really been commenced in his name.

"The mishpachoth of the Beni-Gilead" certainly did not include the Machirites, who were somewhat sharply distinguished from the other Manassites (see above on Numbers 26:29; 32:39 ff.); it is even doubtful whether they included the Gileadites proper, who took their name (and perhaps traced their descent) from Gilead, but not from his sons. It may be confidently  assumed that the Machirites, who had received an extensive and remote territory beyond Jordan, had nothing whatever to do with this application. It was the other section of the tribe, the <span class="accented">mishpachoth</span> of the six sons of Gilead, who were yet to receive inheritance by lot in Canaan proper, to whom the matter appeared so serious that they came to Moses about it.

In practice no property would be considered to have finally changed hands until the year of Jubilee, when an extensive re-settlement took place, and when all titles not successfully challenged would be considered as confirmed. Since the title of the heiress's children could not be challenged, and since any intermediate disposition of the land must then determine, the Jubilee would seem to effect the transfer of which it compelled the recognition. It is, however, none the less strange that the Manassites should have laid such stress upon the practical effects of a piece of legislation which had never yet come into use. It seems to point to the conclusion that the same thing had been customary among them in their Egyptian homes, and that they were acquainted, at least by tradition, with its actual working.

The direction is not altogether plain, since the <span class="accented">tribe</span> (<span class="accented">matteh</span>) contained several families (<span class="accented">mishpachoth</span>), and in this case one or more of the families were widely separated from the rest.

Practically, therefore, they were restricted to the family of the Hepherites (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-32.htm">Numbers 26:32, 33</a>). This is made almost certain when we remember that the territory of the "family" was to be apportioned within the tribe in the same way, and with the same regard to relationship, as the territory of the tribe within the nation (see on Numbers 33:54).

This is one of the words which recur so continually in Deuteronomy and in <a href="../../par/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>.

A similar formula is found at the conclusion of Leviticus (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>), where, however, "the commandments" represents a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), and a third term, "the laws" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>), is added. It is difficult to say confidently what is included under the "these" of this verse. Comparing it with <a href="../../par/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50</a>, it would seem that it only referred to the final regulations and enactments of the last four chapters; but as we have no reason to believe that the later sections of the Book are arranged in any methodical order, we cannot limit <span class="accented">its</span> scope to those, or deny that it may include the laws of chapters 28-30. For a similar reason we cannot say that the use of this concluding formula excludes the possibility of further large additions having been subsequently made to the Divine legislation in the same place and by the same person, as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy. All we can say is, that the Book of Numbers knows nothing about any such additions, and concludes in such sort as to make it a matter of surprise that such additions are afterwards met with. The continuity, which so clearly binds together the main bulk of the four books of Moses, ends with this verse. This fact does not of course decide any question which arises concerning the fifth book; it merely leaves all such questions to be determined on their own merits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/35.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 35"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 35" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../deuteronomy/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Deuteronomy 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Deuteronomy 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/3.htm"><title>Numbers 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/2.htm" title="Numbers 2">&#9668;</a> Numbers 3 <a href="../numbers/4.htm" title="Numbers 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/3-1.htm">Numbers 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">These also <i>are</i> the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day <i>that</i> the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These...  are the generations of Aaron and Moses.</span> The word "generations" (<span class="accented">toledoth</span>) is used here in a peculiar and, so to speak, technical sense, with reference to what follows, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>.

It is almost always assumed that their zeal in the matter of the golden calf was the ground of the preference shown to them now. But it may be doubted whether there was any "preference" in the matter at all. To Aaron and his seed on undoubted and important preference was shown, but the functions and position of the Levites were not such as to give them any preeminence, or to secure them any substantial advantage. They were tied down to the performance of routine duties, which demanded no intelligence, and gave scope for no ambitions. The one obvious reason why Levi was selected is to be found in the fact that he was by far the smallest in numbers among the tribes, being less than half the next smallest, Manasseh, and almost exactly balancing the first-born. A larger tribe could not have been spared, and would not have been needed, for the purpose in question. If any more recondite motive must be sought for the Divine selection, it must be found in the prophecy of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>. Levi as well as Simeon, though in a different way, was doomed never to raise his head as a united and powerful tribe among his brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:13 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because all the first-born are</span> mine (see <a href="../../par/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, and below on verse 43). That the powers of heaven had a special claim upon the firstling of man or beast was probably one of the oldest religious ideas in the world, which it would be difficult to trace to any origin but in some primeval revelation. It branched out into many superstitions, of which the cruel cultus of Moloch was the worst. Among the tribes which preserved the patriarchal faith, it retained more or less of its primitive meaning in the assignment of sacrificial duties to the eldest son. According to the Targums, the "young men of the children of Israel" sent by Moses to offer sacrifices before the consecration of Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>) were first-born. Whatever ancient and latent claims, however, God may have had upon the firstborn of Israel, they are here superseded by a special and recent claim founded upon their miraculous preservation when the first-born of the Egyptians were slain. All the firstborn in that day became "anathema," devoted to God, for evil or for good, for death or for life. He, to whom belongs the whole harvest of human souls, came and claimed his first-fruits from the fields of Egypt. He took unto himself by death the first-born of the Egyptians; he left for himself in life the first-born of the Israelites. For the convenience, however, of the people, and for the better and more regular discharge of the ministry, he was content to take the single small tribe of Levi in lieu of the first-born of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:12 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Instead of all the first-born.</span> The Septuagint inserts here, "they shall be their ransom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:13 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine shall they be: I am the Lord.</span> Rather, "mine shall they be, mine, the Lord's." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:15 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From a month old.</span> The first-born were to be redeemed "from a month old" (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>).

Moses and Aaron were sons of Amram, and they seem to have had but two sons apiece at this time. If, therefore, the family of the Amramites was at all equal in numbers to the other three, they must have had more than 4000 brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. It is urged in reply that Amram lived 137 years, and may have had many other children, and that the variations in the comparative rates of increase are so great and so unaccountable that it is useless to speculate upon them. There is, however, a more serious difficulty connected with the genealogy of Moses and  Aaron, as given here and elsewhere. If they were the great-grandchildren of Levi on their father's side, and his grandchildren on their mother's side, it is impossible to maintain the obvious meaning of <a href="../../par/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>. Either the genealogy must be lengthened, or the time must be very much shortened for the sojourning in Egypt. The known and undoubted habit of the sacred writers to omit names in their genealogies, even in those which seem most precise, lessens the difficulty of the first alternative, whereas every consideration of numbers, including those in this passage, increases the difficulty of the second. To endeavour to avoid either alternative, and to force the apparent statements of Scripture into accord by assuming a multiplicity of unrecorded and improbable miracles at every turn (as, e.g., that Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was restored to youth and beauty at an extreme old age), is to expose the holy writings to contempt. It is much more reverent to believe, either that the genealogies are very imperfect, or that the numbers in the text have been very considerably altered. Every consideration of particular examples, still more the general impression left by the whole narrative, favours the former as against the latter alternative.

It is so obvious that it must have been innocent; no one deliberately falsifying or forging would have left so palpable a discrepancy on the face of the narrative.

Such a reason was found by the Hebrew expositors, and has been accepted by some moderns, in the fact that the Levites were taken and counted instead of the first-born, and that, therefore, their own first-born would have to he excluded. There is nothing to be said against this explanation, except that no trace of it appears in a narrative otherwise very full and minute. The first-born of the Levites <span class="accented">may</span> have been just 300 (although the number is singularly small), and they <span class="accented">may</span> have been considered ineligible for the purpose of redeeming other first-born; but if so, why did not the sacred writer say so, instead of silently reducing the total of "all that were numbered of the Levites"?

The smallness of their number (not much above one per cent. of the whole population) has given rise to several conflicting theories, all of which seem to be artificial, arbitrary, and therefore unsatisfactory. It is urged by some that the expression "every male that openeth the womb" must be strictly pressed, and that there would be no "first-born" in those families (which form a considerable majority) in which either a girl was born first, or the eldest, being a boy, had died. It is further urged that only those first-horn would be counted who were not themselves fathers of families. These considerations will indeed reduce the probable numbers very largely, but not to the required amount. Others, again, give an entirely different turn to the difficulty by urging that as the command in <a href="../../par/exodus/13.htm">Exodus 13</a>. I was prospective only, so at this time only the first-born since the exodus were counted. This makes it necessary to assume an altogether unprecedented birth-rate during that short period. One other explanation strives to satisfy the arithmetical conditions of the problem by assuming that the whole of the Divine legislation in this matter was in reality directed against the worship of Moloch, and was designed to prevent the offering of first-born to him by redeeming them unto himself. As the rites of Moloch only demanded young children of tender age, only such were counted in this census. It may, indeed, be very probably concluded that their heavenly Father <span class="accented">did</span> claim these first-born, partly in order to save them from Moloch, because the people would thereafter be exposed to the fascination of that horrid superstition; but there is no proof whatever that they were acquainted with it at this time. These cruel rites, together with many other heathen abominations, are forbidden in <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, in view of the entry into Canaan, where they were practiced. The prophet Amos, when  he reproaches them with having "carried the tabernacle of" their "Moloch" even in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>), absolves them by implication from any darker superstition; and the highly rhetorical passage <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a> seems to refer to the consequences of disobedience at a later date, and can hardly be pressed against the entire silence of the Pentateuch. Anyhow it does not seem possible, on the strength of a supposed intention on the part of God of which no trace appears in the text, to impose a narrow and arbitrary limit upon the plain command to number "all the first-born, from a month old and upward." If we turn from these speculations to the reason and ground of the matter as stated by God himself, it will appear much more simple. It was distinctly on the ground of their preservation from the destroying angel in Egypt that the first-born of Israel were claimed as God's <span class="accented">peculium</span> now (see verse 13). The command in <a href="../../par/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1</a> was no doubt prospective, but the sanctification of the first-born was based upon the deliverance itself; and this command was intended not to limit that sanctification for the present, but to continue it for the future. Now if we turn to <a href="../../par/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29, 30</a>, and ask who the first-born were whom the destroying angel cut off, we see plainly enough that they included the eldest son, being a child, in every house; that every family lost one, and only one. On the one hand, Pharaoh himself was in all probability a first-born, but he was not in any personal danger, because he ranked and suffered as a father, not as a son. On the other hand, the majority of families in which the first-born was a daughter, or had died, did not therefore escape: "there was not a house where there was not one dead." Taking this as the only sure ground to go upon, we may conclude with some confidence that the first-born now claimed by God in-eluded all the eldest sons in the families of Israel who were not themselves the heads of houses. These were the destroyed in Egypt - these the redeemed in Israel. How they came to be so few in proportion is a matter in itself of extremely slight importance, and dependant, perhaps, upon causes of which no record was left.

Being connected with the word "fat," it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it "cinders." As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire.

Anyhow, the omission is very remarkable, and may have been accidental. It is supplied by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text in the following addition to verse 14: "And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a hyacinthine cover of skin, and put it on bars."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-17.htm">Numbers 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-18.htm">Numbers 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites.</span> The word tribe (<span class="accented">shebet</span>) is used in an unusual way here, not in the sense of <span class="accented">tribus</span>, but of <span class="accented">stirps.</span> Perhaps as Levi was himself a microcosm of all Israel, so his families ranked as tribes; and no doubt they remained more distinct than the families of any other tribe. The meaning of the command is plainly this, "Take care that the Kohathites are not cut off through any negligence or want of consideration on your part; and the form of the command, "cut ye not off," conveyed most emphatically the warning, that if any mischief befell the Kohathites which the priests could have prevented, they would be responsible for it in the sight of God. No doubt, as a fact, the Kohathites would take their cue from the conduct of the priests: if <span class="accented">they</span> were irreverent and careless, the Levites would be the same, and would sooner or later presume, and, presuming, would die. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19</a></div><div class="verse">But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus do unto them,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, exactly as commanded in verses 5-15. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-20.htm">Numbers 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered.</span> This translation is disputed. The word rendered "are covered" is the Piel infinitive from <span class="accented">bala</span>, to swallow, and so to destroy. It may signify the extreme rapidity with which the most holy things were hidden from sight and removed from touch, so as to become, as it were, non-existent for the time. So the Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, and the Targums of Onkelos and Palestine. On the other hand, it may be a proverbial expression, "in a swallow, at a gulp," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "for an instant," as in <a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>. And so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and most modern scholars. Whichever way, however, we take it, the phrase, "they shall not go in to see," seems to limit the prohibition under pain of death to the deliberate act of entering the tabernacle out of curiosity during the process of packing up the holy things. The case of the men of  Bethshemesh, therefore (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>), does not fall within the letter of this law, although it does within its spirit. The command, thus limited, is no doubt an addition to the previous command not to touch, but it is altogether in keeping with it. If it was the will of God to hedge about these sacred symbols of his presence and his worship with an awful sanctity, it is obvious that he was as much bound to defend them against the irreverent prying of the eye as against the irreverent touch of the hand; and the prying here prohibited would have been distinctly willful and inexcusable.

No doubt it <span class="accented">was</span> carried out with extreme solicitude, as made for a purpose especially sacred and important. The results are remarkable in more ways than one. The following table presents the numbers in each family above one month, and between the ages of thirty and fifty. Kohath, 86002750percent 32<br />Gershon, 75002630 <span class="accented"></span><span class="accented"> </span>35<br />Merari, 62003200 5122,800858038The first conclusion which naturally arises from these figures is, that after all the numbering must have been made by tens, and not by individuals. As it was impossible that 3000 persons could be employed in carrying the various portions of the tabernacle, it may be that each group of ten undertook a unit of responsibility. The second consideration is, that the average of men between thirty and fifty in all Levi is higher than modern statistics show (it is said to be twenty-five per cent. now in the whole population), although not very materially. The third is, that this average is very unequally distributed, rising to a most remarkable proportion in the case of Merari. It is quite clear that something must have disturbed the relative numbers as between the Merarites and the other families. It has been suggested that the small number of male Levites generally, and the small number of male Kohathites, between thirty and fifty especially, may have been caused by heavy losses incurred in carrying out the Divine sentence upon the worshippers of the golden calf (<a href="../../par/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>). But - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The slow increase of Levi continued to be very observable down to the time of David; while the other tribes grew from 600,000 to 1,300,000, he only increased to 38,000 (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The average of males over thirty is already higher among the Kohathites than might have been expected; it is the largeness of the number, not the smallness, which needs to be explained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It is Merari, and not Kohath, that is markedly distinguished from the other two: there is little difference between Kohath and Gershon. It is evident that something must have happened to the tribe of Levi, and in especial to the family of Merari, to reduce very greatly the number of births within the last thirty years. We do not know what the causes were, or why they should have pressed much more heavily on one tribe, or one family, than on another; but it is easy to see that many such causes may have acted, and acted unequally, under the cruel tyranny of Pharaoh. The children may have been systematically slaughtered, or marriages may have largely ceased, while Moses was in the land of  Midian. If this were generally the case, it would much diminish the estimated total of the nation, and still more the estimated difficulties of the march.

Of course the only actual consequence was that the ink was mixed with the water, but in the imagination of the people, and to the frightened conscience of a guilty woman, the curses were also held in solution in the water of trial. The direction was founded on a world-wide superstition, still prevalent in Africa, and indeed amongst most semi-barbarous peoples. In the 'Romance of Setnan,' translated by Brugsch. Bey, the scene of which is laid in the time of Rameses the Great, a magical formula written on a papyrus leaf is dissolved in water, and drunk with the effect of imparting all its secrets to him that drinks it. So in the present day, by a similar superstition, do sick Mahomedans swallow texts of  the Koran; and so in the middle ages the canonized Archbishop Edmund Rich (1240) on his death-bed washed a crucifix in water and drank it, saying, "Ye shall drink water from the wells of salvation."

In order to justify heavenly wisdom herein, we must frankly admit, to begin with - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it was founded upon the superstitious notion that immaterial virtue can be imparted to physical elements. The holiness of the gathered dust and the awfulness of the written curses were both supposed to be held in solution by the water of jealousy. The record does not <span class="accented">say</span> as much, but the whole ordeal proceeds on this supposition, which would undoubtedly be the popular one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That it was only fitted for a very rude and comparatively barbarous state of society. The Talmud states that the use of it ceased forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem (if so, during our Lord's earthly lifetime); but it may be held certain that it ceased long before - indeed there is no recorded instance of its use. It was essentially an ordeal, although one Divinely regulated, and as such would have been morally impossible and highly undesirable in any age but <span class="cmt_word">one</span> of blind and uninquiring faith. And we find the justification of it exactly in the fact that it was given to a generation which believed much and knew little; which had a profound belief in magic, and no knowledge of natural philosophy. It was ever the wisdom of God, as revealed in the sacred volume, to take men as they were, and to utilize the superstitious notions which could not at once be destroyed, or the imperfect moral ideas which could not at once be reformed, by making them work for righteousness and peace. It is, above all, the wisdom of God not to destroy the imperfect, but to regulate it and restrain its abuses, and so impress it into his service, until he has educated his people for something higher. Everybody knows the extreme violence of jealousy amongst an uncivilized people, and the widespread misery and crime to which it leads. It may safely be affirmed that <span class="accented">any</span> ordeal which should leave no place for jealousy, because no room for uncertainty, would be a blessing to a people rude enough and ignorant enough to believe in it. Ordeals arc established in a certain stage of civilization because they are wanted, and are on the whole useful, as long as they remain in harmony with popular ideas. They are, however, always liable <span class="cmt_word">to</span> two dangers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They occasionally fail, and are known to have failed, and so fall into disrepute. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They always lend themselves readily to collusion or priestcraft. The trial of jealousy being adopted, as it was, into a system really Divine, and being based upon the knowledge and power of God himself, secured all the benefits of an ordeal and escaped all its dangers. It is probable enough that the awful side of it was never really called into play. No guilty woman would dare to challenge so directly a visitation so dreadful, as long as she retained any faith or any superstition. Before the time came when any Jewish woman had discarded both, the increasing facilities of divorce had provided another and easier escape from matrimonial troubles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

A very little reflection will show that "the Nazarene" not only was no Nazir, but that he even took pains to let it be seen that he was not. John the Baptist was the Nazir of the New Testament, and in all outward things the contrast was strongly marked between them (<a href="../../par/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14, 33, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate <i>themselves</i> to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate <i>themselves</i> unto the LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Either man or woman.</span> It was not a little remarkable that women could be Nazirites, because, generally speaking, the religious condition of women under the law was so markedly inferior and so little considered. But this is altogether consistent with the true view of the Nazirite vow, viz., that it was an exceptional thing, outside the narrow pale of the law, giving scope and allowance to the free movements of the Spirit in individuals. In this too it stood on the same plane as the prophetic office, for which room was left in the religious system of Moses, and which was designed to correct and supplement in its spiritual freedom the artificial routine of that system. As the prophetic office might be exercised by women, so the Nazirite vow might be taken by women. In either case we find a tribute to and a recognition of the Divine liberty of the Holy Ghost, and an anticipation of the time when the spirit of self-devotion should be poured out without distinction upon men and women. Shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the Lord. Rather, "shall make a solemn vow, a Nazirite vow, to live consecrated unto the Lord." The two words translated "separate" are not the same. The first (from <span class="accented">pala</span>, to sever, to consecrate, to distinguish as exceptional) is of somewhat doubtful use here. In <a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19</a> it appears to be used as an intensitive, "did wonderously," and the Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>. The other word (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, to separate) is used in a general sense in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>, or with the addition, "unto the Lord," as in <a href="../../par/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>. It had, however, acquired a technical sense before this, as appears from <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5, 11</a>, where the undressed vines are called "Nazirites," as recalling the unshorn  locks of those who had taken the vow. It is evident indeed, from the way in which the Nazirite vow is here spoken of, that it had been, perhaps long, familiar among the people. All that this commandment did was to recognize the practice, to regulate it minutely, and to adopt it into the religious code of Israel. Whence the custom was derived is wholly uncertain, for although the separate elements existed in many different quarters, yet the peculiar combination of them which made the law of the Nazirite is entirely peculiar. Vows of abstinence have, of course, been common among all religions. Mingled with much of superstition, self-will, and pride, they have sprung in the main from noble impulses and yearnings after a higher life, prompted by the Holy Spirit of God; and it may be said with some confidence, that in spite of all reproaches (deserved or undeserved), such voluntary vows of abstinence have done more than anything else to save religion from becoming an unreal profession. Hair offerings, on the other hand, springing from a simple and natural sentiment, have been common enough amongst the heathen. Compare the sacred locks of Achilles ('Iliad,' 23:142, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>), and the various use of the tonsure in pursuance of vows among the ancient Egyptians (Herod., 2:65) and amongst modern Mahomedans and Christians. The physical fact on which all these hair offerings rest is that the hair is the only portion of oneself which can be conveniently detached and presented.

The expression is best understood as including anything and everything, however unlikely to be used, connected with the grape. It is clear that the abstinence of the Nazirite extended beyond what might possibly intoxicate to what was simply pleasant to the taste, like raisins, or refreshing, like <span class="accented">charnels.</span> The vine represented, by an easy parable, the tree of carnal delights, which yields to the appetite of men such a variety of satisfactions. So among the Romans the Flamen Dialis might not even touch a vine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth <i>himself</i> unto the LORD, he shall be holy, <i>and</i> shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall no razor come upon his head.</span> The meaning of this law is <span class="cmt_word">best</span> understood from the case of Samson, whose strength was in his hair, and departed from him when his hair was cut. No doubt that strength was a more or less supernatural gift, and it went and came with his hair according to some supernatural law; but it is clear that the connection was not merely arbitrary, but was founded on some generally received idea. To the Jew, differing in this from the shaven Egyptian and the short-haired Greek, the hair represented the virile powers of the adult, growing with its growth, and failing again with its decay. To use a simple analogy from nature, the uncropped locks of the Nazirite were like the mane of the male lion, a symbol of the fullness of his proper strength and life (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25, 26</a>, and, for the disgrace of baldness, <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>). In later ages Western and Greek feeling on the subject prevailed over Eastern and Jewish, and a "Hebrew of the Hebrews" was able to argue that "even nature itself" teaches us "that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-14.htm">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>). No doubt "nature itself" taught the Greek of Corinth that lesson; but no doubt also "nature itself" taught the Jew of Palestine exactly the opposite lesson; and the Apostle himself did not quite discard the earlier sentiment, for he too made a Nazirite vow, and suffered his hair to grow while it lasted (<a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>). The meaning, therefore, of the law was that the whole fullness of the man's vitality was to be dedicated without any diminution to the Lord, as typified by the free growth of his hair. It has been conjectured that it was allowed to the Nazirite to "poll" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) his hair during his vow, although not to "shave" it (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and in this way the statement is explained that St. Paul "polled his head" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>, compared with Acts 21:24) in Cenchraea, because he had a vow. It is, however, quite evident that any permission to cut the hair is inconsistent with the whole intention of the commandment; for if a man might "poll his head" when he pleased, he would not be distinguished from other men. If it was allowed in the Apostle's time, it is only another instance of the way in Which the commandments of God were made of none effect by the traditions of men.

This may have had some foundation in fact, but the true explanation of the three rules is rather to be found in the spiritual truth they teach in a simple and forcible way.

Blessing in or with the  name of the Supreme Being was an important part of all primitive religion, as appears from the case of Melchizedec and Abraham, of Isaac and his sons, of Jacob and Pharaoh. And this act of blessing was far from being a mere expression of good will, or from being a simple prayer; for" without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-7.htm">Hebrews 7:7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the blessing must be given by one who stands nearer to God to one who stands less near. The name of God could not be used in blessing save by one who had some right to such use of it, whether as prophet, as priest, or as patriarch. For that name in which the blessing was given <span class="accented">was</span> not inoperative, but was mighty with untold spiritual efficacy where rightly used as the name of blessing. To Aaron and to his sons was now confided this use of the Divine name, that all Israel might know and might hear in their appointed words the voice of God himself. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them.</span> The benediction here appointed consists of three clauses, each complete in itself, and each consisting of two members, the second of which seems to present the application and result in experience of the grace besought in the first. Both, therefore, in its form and its contents this benediction is one of the most profound and most fruitful of the Divine oracles; and this indeed we might have expected, because (if we may venture to say so) God is never so entirely and absolutely himself as in blessing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord,...  the Lord,...  the Lord.</span> Are we to see in this threefold use of the Divine name a shadowing forth of the Holy Trinity? It is obvious that it cannot be proved, and that it would not even have suggested any such idea to the priest who gave, or to the people who received, the benediction. To them the threefold form merely added beauty and fullness to the blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>). But that is not the question. The real question is whether the Old Testament was written for our sakes (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15, 16</a>), and whether the God of the Jews was indeed the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>). If so, it is not possible for us to avoid seeing in this benediction a declaration of the threefold Being of God, and it is not possible to avoid believing that he meant us to see such a declaration, veiled indeed from the eyes of the Jew, but clear enough to the Christian.

The "name of God is uniformly treated in Scripture as something very different from a mere arrangement of letters or an arbitrary vocal sound. All nations have bad names for the Supreme Being, but there was nothing sacred about them, except from association. <span class="accented">The</span> name of God was not of man, nor from man, but of his own direct revelation (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>), and was therefore of an unspeakable sanctity (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>). Like the "word" of God, it cannot be dissociated from God himself. It is in some sense an extension outwards, into the sphere of the created and sensible, of the ineffable virtues of the Godhead itself. It stands in a real, though un-assignable, relation to infinite goodness and power, and therefore it comes fraught with untold blessing (or perchance cursing) to those on whom it lights. Hence, to put the name of God - the covenant name - upon the people had a real meaning. No one could do it except by his express direction; and when it was so done there was an invisible reality answering to the audible form; with the name pronounced in blessing came the blessing itself, came the special providence and presence of God, to abide upon such at least as were worthy of it. It is a fact, the significance of which cannot be denied, that the name which was commanded to be put upon the people was lost, and irrecoverably lost, by the later Jews. Out of an exaggerated   dread of possible profanation, they first disobeyed the command by substituting Adonai for that name outside the sanctuary; and finally, after the death of Simeon the Just, the priests ceased to pronounce that name at all, and therefore lost the tradition by which the pronunciation was fixed. Our method of spelling and pronouncing the name as Jehovah is merely conventional, and almost certainly incorrect. It would seem to be the more devout opinion that the name itself, as revealed by God and uttered by many generations of priests, was forfeited (like Paradise), was withdrawn, and ought not to be inquired after. <span class="cmt_word">And I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">bless them.</span> Here is the precise truth of all effectual benediction: <span class="accented">they</span> shall put my name;...  <span class="accented">I</span> will bless. The outward form was ministered by the priests, the inward reality was of God and from God alone.

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>), has given rise to considerable difficulty. Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>); and so the Targum of Palestine, "It was on the day which begins the month Nisan." It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> here as in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>, "at the time." It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the first half of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">had anointed</span> it. From <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, as compared with <a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33-35</a> refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/7-2.htm">Numbers 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who <i>were</i> the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes of Israel.</span> These arc the same men, and are called by the same titles, as those Divinely nominated in <a href="../../par/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> No doubt they were the heads of the nations according to some established rules of precedence before the exodus. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">were over them that were numbered.</span> Hebrew, "stood over."

Emis. understands it as meaning "two-wheeled vehicles." It is a matter of little importance, but the nature of the country itself and the small number of oxen to each carriage point to the probability that they had no wheels, and were carried by the oxen, one in front, and one behind, by means of shafts, as is still the case in parts of India.

Hebrew, <span class="accented">ohel moed</span>, where God had promised to <span class="accented">meet</span> with him (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To speak with him,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with God, as implied in the word "meeting." <span class="cmt_word">He heard the voice of one speaking unto him.</span> Rather, "he heard the voice conversing with him," making itself audible to him. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, part. Hithpael, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, &c.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see <a href="../../par/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he spake unto him,</span> i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/8.htm"><title>Numbers 8 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/8.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/8.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/8-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/7.htm" title="Numbers 7">&#9668;</a> Numbers 8 <a href="../numbers/9.htm" title="Numbers 9">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord spake unto Moses.</span> It does not appear when. The attempt of modern commentators to find a real connection between this section and the offering of the princes or the consecration of the Levites is simply futile. Such connection may be imagined, but the same ingenuity would obviously be equally successful if this section had been inserted in any other place from <a href="../../par/exodus/37.htm">Exodus 37</a>, to the end of this book. The more probable explanation will be given below. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/8-2.htm">Numbers 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou lightest the lamps.</span> The command to light the lamps had been given generally ("they shall light the lamps thereof") in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, and the care of them had been specially confided to Aaron and his sons ("from evening to morning") in <a href="../../par/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>. The actual lighting of the lamps for the first time by Moses is recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>. In the face of these passages it is incredible that the lamps had not been regularly lighted by Aaron for more than a month before the offering of the princes. The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. It is somewhat uncertain what this expression, here  repeated from <a href="../../par/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, means. The Targums give no explanation of it; the Septuagint merely renders verbally, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Jewish expositors seem to have thought that the light was to be thrown inward towards the central shaft; most modern commentators, with more probability, understand it to mean that the lamps were to be so placed as to throw their light across the tabernacle towards the north side.

It may be simply this, that these verses originally followed verse 89 of the previous chapter, and followed it still when it was inserted, for reasons already suggested, after the narrative of the offerings of the princes. Why, or how, such an admission should discredit the sacred narrative or imperil the truth of its inspiration it would be hard to say. The only thing really likely to imperil the sacred narrative is to persistently deny the obvious literary conclusions which arise from an honest consideration of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 8:5-26 THE HALLOWING OF THE LEVITES (verses 5-23).

There was in their case no ceremonial washing, no vesting in sacred garments, no anointing with holy oil, or sprinkling with the blood of sacrifices. The Levites, in fact, remained simply representatives of the congregation, whereas the priests were representatives also of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and <i>so</i> make themselves clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sprinkle water of purifying upon them.</span> Rather, "water of sin," so called because it had to do with the removal of sin, just as "water of separation" (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9, 13</a>) was that which delivered from the legal state of separation. It is not likely to have been prepared in the same manner as this latter (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>), both because of the great difference between the two cases, and because the ordinance of the red heifer belonged to a later period. Nor is it likely to have resembled that used for cleansing the leper, or the water of jealousy. But it is rash to conclude that, because we do not read any special directions for its preparation, it must, therefore, have been nothing trot water from the laver which stood in the outer court. That water appears, indeed, to be called "holy water" in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-17.htm">Numbers 5:17</a>, which is intelligible enough; but no probable reason  can be shown why it should be called "sin water;" it would seem as reasonable to call the water which our Lord turned into wine "sill water," because it stood there "for the purifying of the Jews." It is better to say that we do not know, because it is not recorded, how this water was prepared, or how it corresponded to its name. The Levites who were to be sprinkled would seem to have included all the males, some twenty thousand in number; because it was <span class="accented">all</span> the males, and not only those between thirty and fifty, who were to be dedicated in place of the first-born. In any case it was, of course, impossible that Moses could have sprinkled them individually (see below on verse 11). <span class="cmt_word">Let them shave all their flesh.</span> Literally, "let them cause the razor to pass over their whole body." Some distinguish between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> here and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8, 9</a>, as though the latter meant a much more complete shaving off of the hair than the former; but this difference is doubtful; the fact that the whole body as well as the head was to be shaved implies that it was more than a mere cutting short of the hair. <span class="cmt_word">Let them wash their clothes.</span> This was constantly enjoined on all the faithful as a preparation for any special religious service (see on Exodus 19:10). <span class="cmt_word">And so make themselves clean.</span> The shaving and washing had, no doubt, a symbolic significance, but their primary object was simply and obviously personal cleanliness; it is the hair and the clothes that chiefly harbour impurities, especially in a hot climate.

It might seem as if the larger animal were meant to distinguish aggregate or collective guilt (see on Leviticus 4:3); but the scapegoat offered for the sin of the whole people makes against such a supposition.

This injunction seems conclusive that the whole ceremonial was to be symbolically per. formed, for the Levites could not possibly be waved in any literal sense. Some have supposed that they were marched up and down before the altar, forgetting that the court would scarcely afford standing room for 1000 people, while the Levites between thirty and fifty numbered more than 8000. It is certain that the Levites could only be brought before the Lord, could only be waved (howsoever that was done), could only lay their hands upon the bullocks, by representation. If we suppose, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that a hundred men of position and command among them entered the court as representatives of the tribe, then we can understand how the ceremonial here commanded might have been effectively carried out. <span class="cmt_word">That they may execute the service of the Lord.</span> Literally, "that they may be to execute the service of the Lord." Their being waved made them over in a figure to the Lord to be wholly his, and to live only for his service, and at his command.

It is usually confined to purely sacerdotal ministrations, but it clearly has a somewhat different scope here. The idea that the Levites "made an atonement" by assisting the priests in the subordinate details of sacrifice hardly needs refutation: as well might the Gibeonites be said to "make an atonement" because they supplied the altar fire with wood. The real parallel to this is to be found in the case of Phinehas, of whom God testified that "he hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel," and "made an atonement for the children of Israel" (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11, 13</a>). It is evident that Phinehas turned away the wrath of God not by offering any sacrifices, but by making the sin which aroused that wrath to cease: he made an atonement for the people by discharging for them that holy and bounden  duty (of putting away sin) which the rest of them failed to perform. Similarly the Levites made an atonement not by offering sacrifice (which they could no more do than the children of Judah), but by rendering unto God those personal duties of attendance and service in his courts which <span class="accented">all</span> the people ought to have rendered had they only been fit. <span class="cmt_word">That there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.</span> See <a href="../../par/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>. The children of Israel were in this strait. As "an holy nation," they were all bound, and their first-born as redeemed from the destroyer were specially bound, to render certain religious duties to God. But if they had attempted to render them they would have erred through ignorance and foolishness, and so <span class="accented">have</span> incurred Divine wrath and punishment, when they came nigh unto the sanctuary. From this strait the substitution of the Levites delivered them.

That direction, however, concerned the transport of the tabernacle and its belongings; this was a permanent regulation designed for the ordinary labours of the sanctuary at a time when the Levites would be scattered throughout their cities, and could only serve by courses. For the latter purpose many more would be required; and indeed they were found insufficient as it was in the latter days of David, when the wealth and devotion of the kingdom were fast increasing (see on 1 Chronicles 23:24-27). <span class="cmt_word">To wait upon the service.</span> Literally, "to war the warfare;" the idea of the <span class="accented">militia sacra</span> is kept up.

The word "charge" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mishmereth</span>) seems to signify the care of the furniture and belongings of the tabernacle, while "service" means the laborious work of transport, or of preparing sacrifice. The duties of the Levite over fifty were in fact honorary, given to him probably for his own sake, that he might have some place and post in the house of God. This careful provision for those who should attain the age of fifty shows that the commandment was designed for the promised land rather than for the wilderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/numbers/9.htm"><title>Numbers 9 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/numbers/9.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/numbers/9.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/numbers/9-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../numbers/8.htm" title="Numbers 8">&#9668;</a> Numbers 9 <a href="../numbers/10.htm" title="Numbers 10">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first month of the second year.</span> Before the census, and all the other events recorded in this book, except in part the offerings of the princes (see <a href="../../par/numbers/7-1.htm">Numbers 7:1</a>).

They may have been in doubt as to whether they were to keep it in the wilderness, and indeed they do not seem to have attempted to keep it again until they reached the promised land (see on Joshua 5:5, 6). The passover had indeed been made an "ordinance for ever," but only when they were come to the land which the Lord should give them (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>). Apart, therefore, from express command, it would have been doubtful whether the feast should not at least he postponed. Inasmuch, however, as they had been detained at Sinai by Divine direction (albeit partly in consequence of their own idolatry, but for which they might already have been "at home"), it pleased God that they should not lack the blessing and support of the passover at its proper season. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At even.</span> See on Exodus 12:6. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the rites of it, and according</span> to all <span class="cmt_word">the ceremonies thereof.</span> This must be understood only of the essential rites and ceremonies of the passover, as mentioned below (verses 11, 12). It is singular that no mention is made of the considerable departure which circumstances necessitated from the original institution. It was not possible, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to strike the blood of the lamb upon the lintel and the side-posts of the doors, because in the wilderness they had no doors. In after ages this rite (which was of the essence of the institution) was represented by the sprinkling of the blood of the lambs on the altar (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), but no command is on record which expressly authorized the change. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-16</a> there is indeed a general direction, applying apparently to all domestic animals slain for food, that they be brought to the tabernacle to be slain, and that the priest sprinkle the blood upon the altar; and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-7</a> there is an order that in future times the passover was only to be slain at the place which the Lord should choose. The actual practice in later ages seems to have been founded partly upon the command in Deuteronomy, which restricted the killing <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the passover to Jerusalem (not, however, to the temple), and partly on the command in Leviticus, which really applied (at any rate in the letter) to the time of wandering only. As the celebration of the paschal feast had apparently been neglected from the time of Joshua until that of the later kings (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-21.htm">2 Kings 23:21-22</a>.), they were no doubt guided in the observance of it by the analogy of other sacrifices in the absence of express commands. It would, however, be an obvious source of error to assume that the practice of the age of Josiah or Hezekiah was the practice of the earliest passovers; so far as these necessarily differed from the original institution, it is absolutely uncertain <span class="cmt_word">how</span>  the difficulty was solved. Nothing perhaps better illustrates the mingled rigidity and elasticity of the Divine ordinances than the observance of the passover, in which so much of changed detail was united with so real and so unvarying a uniformity.

The first difficulty does not seem serious when we consider, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that kids were available as well as lambs (see on Exodus 12:3); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the desert tribes would have abundance of lambs and kids for sale at this season, and that the Israelites certainly had money; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that in view of their speedy departure they would be disposed to kill off the young of their own flocks. The second difficulty is more serious, and would be insurmountable if we had to believe that the ritual of this passover was the same which afterwards prevailed. Josephus tells us ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3) that in his day 256,000 lambs were slain and their blood sprinkled upon the altar within the three hours "between the evenings." At that time, according to the same authority, a lamb was shared by ten, and often by as many as twenty people. The number of males who would partake of the paschal meal in the wilderness may be set down as not more than 800,000. If the women partook of it at all (which is very doubtful; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44, 48</a>), they would doubtless content themselves with the scraps left by the men. Allowing twenty souls to each lamb, the number required would be not more than 40,000. It is obvious at once that the three priests could not possibly kill 40,000 lambs in three hours, much less sprinkle their blood upon the altar; indeed the same may be said for 10,000, or even 5000, especially as they could not have acquired the extreme dexterity and dispatch which long practice taught to the later priests. Nor is it satisfactory to reply that the priests did the work "out of the hand of the Levites ' (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because this passover took place before the Levites were formally separated for the service of God and of the priests (see <a href="../../par/numbers/8-22.htm">Numbers 8:22</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the smallness of the space about the altar would not allow of many people assisting; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the actual slaying and sprinkling, which was restricted to the priests (being distinctively sacrificial in nature), are the very things which we find impossible in the time. There are but two alternative conclusions, from one or other of which there is no honest escape: either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the numbers of the people are greatly exaggerated, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the ritual of after days was not observed on this occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to (a), see what is said on the whole question of numbers in the Introduction. As to (b), it must be borne in mind that no direction whatever had been given, as far as we know, either that the lambs must be slain by the priests only, or that their blood must be poured upon the altar. If the Jews were left to follow the original institution as nearly as possible, they would have killed the lambs themselves, and sprinkled the blood around the doors of their tents. It is true that according to the Levitical ritual, now recently put into use, all other animals slain in sacrifice (or indeed for food) must be slain at the tabernacle by the priest, and the blood sprinkled on the altar; and it is true that this general rule was afterwards held especially binding in the case of the passover. But there is nothing to show that it was held binding then: the passover had been ordained before the establishment of the Levitical priesthood and law of sacrifice; and it might very well have been considered that it retained its primal character unaffected by subsequent legislation, and that the priesthood of the people (in other rites transferred to Aaron and his sons) was recalled and revived in the case of this special rite. If this was the case both at this passover and at that under Joshua, it is easy enough to understand why the later practice was so entirely different; the neglect or disuse of centuries obliterated the tradition of the passover, and when it was revived by the later kings, they naturally followed the analogy of all other sacrifices, and the apparently express command of <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-6</a>. They could not indeed obey this command in their daily life, but they could and did obey it in the striking and typical case of the paschal feast. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were certain men.</span> It has been supposed by many that these men must have been Mishael and Elizaphan, who had recently (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>) been defiled by burying their cousins Nadab and Abihu. This, however, is based upon the assumption that the totals given in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> and in <a href="../../par/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a> are really independent, and that therefore no one belonging to any other tribe than that of Levi had died in the interval. As that assumption is untenable (see above on chapter Numbers 1:46), so this "coincidence" falls to the ground. We know indeed that Mishael and Elizaphan were defiled at this time, and we do not know that any one else was; but, on the other hand, the words "the dead body of a man" seem to point to a single corpse only. <span class="cmt_word">Dead body.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-11.htm">Numbers 6:11</a>, and other places. It is inexplicable how this word, which properly means "soul," should have come to be used of a corpse; perhaps it is an additional testimony to the complete absence from Jewish teaching of  any doctrine of an immortal spirit.

It was in the spirit of this command, though not in the letter of it, that Hezekiah acted (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>). And possibly it was in the spirit of this command that our Lord acted when he ate the passover by anticipation with his disciples twenty-four hours before the proper time - at which time he was himself to be the Lamb slain. <span class="cmt_word">With unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</span> These and the following directions are expressly added for fear lest any should think that the little passover might be celebrated with less solemnity and with less carefulness than the great passover. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-12.htm">Numbers 9:12</a></div><div class="verse">They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to all the ordinances of the passover.</span> The later Jews held that this passover need only be kept for one day, and that leaven need not be put away from the house. But this was a clear departure from the original rule, for it was evidently intended that it should be in all respects a true passover, and in this case six clear days were allowed for the keeping of it (see on Numbers 10:11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">But the man that <i>is</i> clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">the man that is clean, and is not in a journey.</span> This threat was added no doubt in order to prevent men from taking advantage of the permission to keep a supplemental passover in order to suit their own convenience or interest.

It was rather the eating of the lamb that was insisted upon, as placing the partaker in communion with the God and Church of Israel, and so in a state of salvation. But after the law of sacrifices had been elaborated, then the paschal lamb, though prior to them all, naturally took its place amongst them as the greatest of them all, and as uniting in itself the special beauties of all.

Everything after that was but preparatory to the approaching departure, and therefore is narrated not in any order of time, but either as it referred back to the first day of the first month, or forward to the twentieth day of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">The cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony.</span> The testimony was the decalogue written on the two tables of stone, and enshrined within the ark, the moral law which lay at the heart of Judaism. The tent of the testimony was the holy of holies in which the ark dwelt (see on Numbers 10:11; 18:2). The exact meaning of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;</span> is disputed, or the rather significance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> with which the phrase "tent of the testimony" is appended to the word "tabernacle" (dwelling). Some take it as equivalent in construction to the genitive, "the dwelling of the tent of the testimony;" in which case it would simply mean that the cloud covered the whole tabernacle, the <span class="accented">mishcan</span> which enveloped and enclosed the <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which again enshrined the ark and the testimony. Others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> here in the sense of "at" or "towards," and read, "covered the dwelling, towards the tent of the testimony," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, over that part of it in which the testimony was kept. Apart from the strict grammatical question, the comparison of other passages cited (especially <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>) seems in favour of the first interpretation, and so apparently the Septuagint and the Targums.

It would appear from <a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a> that there was nothing new in the fact of the cloudy fiery pillar directing the movements of the host, but only in the fact of its resting on the tabernacle when in repose. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the place where the cloud abode,</span> or "came down." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>. As the tabernacle was taken all to pieces, and its portions widely separated on the march, the cloud could not rest upon it as a signal for halting. We must probably picture to ourselves the cloud rising to some considerable height when it was "taken up," so as to be visible for a great distance, and as settling down again over the spot where the tabernacle was to be set up. In this way the signals given by the cloud would be immediately perceived by a vast multitude.
