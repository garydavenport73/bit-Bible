Something of this kind seems to have occurred in the wilderness, when God's law was first given to his people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12</a>); and therefore, when renewals of the covenant were made, and the people were required to ratify the act, it was natural to recur to the old sanction, An oath was probably taken of the people in the time of Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>), when they are said to have "stood to the covenant." <span class="cmt_word">Moses the servant of God</span>.

This precept of the law had been frequently neglected during the times of the monarchy, and its neglect was one of the sins which the captivity was expressly intended to punish (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). It now appears that after the return the precept had been again disobeyed. <span class="cmt_word">The exaction of every debt.</span> Literally, "the pledge of every hand." Compare <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-2.htm">Nehemiah 5:2-13</a>, and note that, notwithstanding Nehemiah's curse and the people's assent to it (ver. 13), the practice of lending upon pledge had recommenced.

Hitherto the Jews had had no impost analogous to our "church-rate." The "half-shekel of the sanctuary," as it is called, being only payable on the rare, and forbidden, occasion of a census of the whole people (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-16</a>), could not possibly have served for the ordinary support of the temple service; but it was calculated to suggest to thoughtful minds the need of some regular fund, and the persons on whom the obligation lay to provide it. While the Jews were an independent nation, with their own kings and their own revenue, no difficulty had been felt in keeping up the service, since the kings easily provided for it; but in the existing condition of affairs the case was different. A "governor" was not like a king; he was responsible; he was removable; he was bound to remit the great bulk of the taxes to the court. Under these circumstances, and probably in connection with an immediate need, the idea arose of a special (voluntary) tax, to be paid annually by all adult males, for the support of the service, the continual provision of the morning and evening sacrifice, the incense, the shew-bread, the red heifers, the scape-goat, the numerous victims, and the numerous meat and drink offerings required on various occasions, and especially at each of the great festivals. It was felt that the provision in the law ruled two things - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The uniformity of the tax; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The sphere of its incidence - that it should be paid by <span class="accented">all</span> adult males. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With regard to its proper amount, <span class="accented">that</span> had to be fixed by a consideration of existing needs in comparison with existing means. The third part of a shekel was determined on, as sufficient at the time; but it was not long ere for the third part the half-shekel was substituted, a return being thus made to the standard fixed by the law, and an ample provision made for the maintenance of the established rites in full completeness and efficiency (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>).

The "wood offering" is now first heard cf. Fuel had probably been more plentiful in the times of the monarchy than it had now become, and the temple treasury had been rich enough to provide what was needed in order to keep the altar fire perpetually burning (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>). But times had changed. The hill-country of Judaea had gradually been stripped of its forests. The temple was, comparatively speaking, poor, and some permanent arrangement for the supply of the required fuel had become necessary. It would seem, from the present passage, that the arrangement actually made was one by which different families or districts undertook the duty of furnishing the wood in turn, and lots were cast to determine the order in which they should discharge the office. According to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 17, &sect; 6), the wood needed for a year was brought in on a particular day - the fourteenth day of the fifth month  - which was kept as a festival, and known as the "Xylophoria." <span class="cmt_word">At times appointed year by year</span>. It may be gathered from this that, originally, no single day was selected for bringing in all the wood; much less one and the same day appointed for every year. The original system was variable and elastic; but in course of time a rigid uniformity was introduced and established. <span class="cmt_word">As it is written in the law</span>.

As with the law of first-fruits, so with that of tithes (which was more burthensome), there had grown up a practice of neglecting it on the part of  many, if not of all. The natural result  would be the non-attendance of Levites at  Jerusalem, and so a falling-off in the  solemnity and grandeur of the temple-worship (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>). It was now  covenanted afresh on the part of the people  that they would resume the legal practice,  at any rate to the extent of paying what has  been called "the first tithe," or that due to  the Levites for their sustentation. <span class="cmt_word">In all  the cities of our tillage</span>. The Levitical tithe  was not taken to Jerusalem. but stored up in  some neighbouring, generally Levitical, city.

Jerusalem was the residence of all the nobles from the first (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>); no increase could be made in this element of the population. Nehemiah had to look lower, and to obtain his new settlers from the ranks of the "people." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The people ... cast lots.</span> No doubt under direction. The Jews had frequent recourse to the lot for the determining of doubtful matters, believing, as they did, that "the whole disposing thereof was of the Lord (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Divine sanction had been given, in  the course of the Jewish history, to the use  of the lot for the selection of persons (Joshua 7:16-18 <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19-21</a>), for the distribution of lands (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25, 26</a>), and  for the determination of the order in which  different bodies should execute an office  (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>). In the democratic states of Greece it was used widely to determine between candidates for an office. One in ten. Ewald supposes that this was to be the proportion between the population of Jerusalem and the whole population of the country, and ascribes the fixing of the proportion to Zerubbabel ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 159). But there is no statement to this effect in either Ezra or Nehemiah, and the brief narrative of this verse seems to imply the addition of a tenth part of the country population to the previous population of Jerusalem, rather than the establishment of any definite proportion between the two. Nine parts. Literally, "nine <span class="accented">hands</span>," as in <a href="../../par/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>.

A comparison is in the writer's mind between the Jews of Palestine and those of the great Persian capitals, Babylon and Susa, to which, as a Persian official, he himself properly belongs.

It follows that those who removed from the country districts to Jerusalem quitted their "possessions, often, it may be, exchanging riches for poverty, a comfortable house for one half in ruins (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a>), and the life of a small landed proprietor for that of an artisan or hired labourer. Hence the "blessings" called down by the people on those who volunteered (ver. 2). Israel. Compare <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a>, where we find that among those who had returned were mere-bers of the two great Israelitish tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.

LIST OF THE HIGH PRIESTS FROM JESHUA TO JADDUA (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>). That this is the line of descent in the high priestly family of the time sufficiently appears both from the names themselves, and from the position assigned to those who bore them in vers. 22, 23, 26. Whether all of them actually exercised the high priest's office is left uncertain in Scripture, but satisfactorily established by Josephus. The six names cover a space of at least 205 years - from the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus,  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, to the submission of Jerusalem to Alexander the Great,  <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, which gives very long generations, but still such as are historically possible. Jeshua was certainly high priest from  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span>. He may have been succeeded by his son, Joiakim, about  <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>. Joiakim had certainly been succeeded by his son, Eliashib, before  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>); and Eliashib was probably succeeded by Joiada about  <span class="date">B.C. 420</span>. Joiada's high priesthood may be assigned to the period between  <span class="date">B.C. 420</span> and 380; Jonathan's to that between  <span class="date">B.C. 380</span> and 350. Jaddua might then hold the dignity from  <span class="date">B.C. 350</span> to 330, or later, and so be brought into contact with Alexander the Great. It is questioned whether in that case Nehemiah can have written the present passage, and certain that he cannot have done so unless he lived to be at least 131 years of age. As this is exceedingly improbable, it is best to suppose, either that the whole list was placed here by Malachi, or at any rate that that prophet added the clause, "and Jonathan begat Jaddua." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshua</span>.

Josephus, who calls him "Jannseus" (  =   John), says that he murdered his own brother, Jeshua, in the temple, because he was endeavouring to supplant him in the high priesthood through the influence of the Persians. <span class="cmt_word">Jaddua</span> is mentioned as high priest at the time of Alexander's entrance into Jerusalem by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:8, &sect; 5) and Eusebius ('Chron. Can.,' 2. p. 346). The story of Alexander's having previously seen him in a dream is not generally credited. He is said to been high priest for twenty years, and to have outlived Alexander. LIST OF THE HEADS OF THE PRIESTLY COURSES IN THE TIME OF THE HIGH PRIEST JOIAKIM (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a>). Joiakim must have been contemporary with Xerxes, and consequently have been high priest at the time when the very existence of the Jewish people was threatened by Haman. It is curious that we have no record of his high priesthood, nor of the condition of the Palestinian Jews at the time, beyond the slight hints furnished by this chapter. These hints seem to imply that under him special attention was paid to the formation of lists, especially of the chief priests and Levites, and that the temple service was celebrated with great exactness and regularity (vers. 24-26). The present list is particularly valuable, as enabling us to check that with which the chapter opens, and as establishing the <span class="accented">family</span> character of the names whereof that list is made up.

It will be observed that the family names of the priestly, courses follow the order of the same names in vers. 1-7, and exactly accord with them, excepting in minute differences of spelling, and in one omission - that of the name of "Hattush.' It might be supposed that the family of Hattush had died out; but this is contradicted by its reappearance among the signatures to the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-4.htm">Nehemiah 10:4</a>); the omission here would therefore appear to be accidental.

The conjunction "and' occurring here, exactly as it does in ver. 6, once only in the whole list, and before the same name, shows that the two documents (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7, 12-21</a>) are from the same hand. That the hand is that of Nehemiah, or a contemporary, seems to follow from the fact that no reason can be assigned for the division, or for the low place in the lists of the names Joiarib and Jedaiah, except the failure of these families to set their seals to the covenant (see the comment on ver. 6). PARENTHETIC STATEMENT OF THE TIME DOWN TO WHICH EXACT LISTS OF THE LEADING PRIESTS AND LEVITES WERE KEPT (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22, 23</a>). These verses appear to constitute a late insertion. They interrupt the list of high church officers in the time of Joiakim, which is commenced in ver. 12 and not concluded till ver. 26. By their mention of Jaddua as high priest, and of "Darius the Persian" as contemporary king, they betray a writer who lived at least as late as  <span class="date">B.C. 336</span>, or nearly a century after the time of Nehemiah's religious reforms. The facts put on record by this writer are not of very much importance. They seem to be simply these: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the practice of accurately recording the heads of the priestly and Levitical courses, which Nehemiah has noted as belonging to the days of Joiakim, was continued under his successors, Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, down (at any rate) to the accession of Darius Codomannus; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That in the case of the Levites the lists were inserted into the book of the chronicles - not our "Book," but that larger one, of which ours is in the main an abbreviation - down to the time of Johanan, the son (or, rather, grandson) of Eliashib. It has been supposed that the writer originally accompanied these statements with lists that have been lost, but this does not appear to be probable.

But this is unlikely, since there was nothing to recall that unimportant personage to the thoughts of the writer.

The actual names - Jeshua, Kadmiel, Hashabiah, Shersbiah, etc. - are all found as family names.

DEDICATION OF THE WALL OF JERUSALEM UNDER NEHEMIAH AND EZRA, WITH NEHEMIAH'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE TEMPLE OFFICERS, AND HIS EFFORTS FOR THE REFORM OF RELIGION (CH. 12:27-47, AND CH. 13.). DEDICATION OF THE WALL (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>). It is supposed by some that the author has here departed from the chronological order, and gone back to a date not much subsequent to the completion of the wall in September,  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, since the dedication of a work under ordinary circumstances follows closely upon its accomplishment. But no reason has been shown for the actual place held by the narrative in the Book upon this supposition, nor is it easy to imagine that the author would have separated the dedication of the wall from its completion by five chapters and a half, unless they had been separated in fact by an interval of some duration. The interval seems, by the notes of time contained in chs. 12, 13, to have been one of nearly thirteen <span class="accented">years.</span> Nehemiah's religious reforms were certainly subsequent to the visit that he paid to the Persian court in  <span class="date">B.C. 432</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>). These reforms grew out of a reading of the law which took place at the time when Nehemiah appointed the temple officers (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>), and that appointment followed closely on the dedication (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>). We may account for the long delay by supposing that Nehemiah was afraid of offending Artaxerxes if he ventured on a ceremony, to which the superstition of the surrounding heathen may have attached extreme importance, without his express permission, and that to obtain this permission his personal influence was necessary. The dedication of a city wall was, so far as we know, a new thing in Israel; but it had been customary from a remote time to dedicate houses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>); and natural piety extended this practice to aggregations of houses, and to the limit or fence by which they were practically made one. The priestly order had shown its sense of the fitness of such a consecration when they raised their portion of the wall, and had at once "sanctified it" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Nehemiah now, by the ceremony which he planned and carried out, placed the whole circuit of the wall under the Divine protection, confessing in this solemn act the intrinsic worthlessness of mere walls and bulwarks, unless God lends them strength and makes them a protection against enemies.

The place of assemblage must have been some portion of the western wall, probably the central portion, near the modern Jaffa gate. From this Ezra's company proceeded southward, and then eastward, along the southern wall, while Nehemiah's marched northward, and then eastward, along the northern wall, both processions meeting midway in the eastern wall, between the "water" and the "prison" gates. <span class="cmt_word">Toward the dung gate</span>.

Starting from the same part of the western wall as the other, its course was northward to the N.W. angle of the city wall, after which it was eastward to the "sheep gate, and then southward to the "prison gate." In this part of his description Nehemiah traces the same portion of the wall as that which had engaged his attention in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-11</a>, and mentions almost exactly the same features, but <span class="accented">in the reverse order. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For the tower of the furnaces</span> see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>; <span class="cmt_word">for the broad wall</span>, ver. 8; <span class="cmt_word">for the old gate</span>, ver. 6; <span class="cmt_word">for the fish gate</span>, ver. 3; <span class="cmt_word">for the tower of Hananeel, the tower of Meah, and the sheep</span> gate, ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">gate of Ephraim</span> is not mentioned in ch. 3.

David had inaugurated the "tabernacle" which he made for the ark of the covenant at Jerusalem with sacrifice (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), and had consecrated the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite in the same way (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>). Solomon, at his dedication of the temple, had sacrificed sheep and oxen "that could not be numbered for multitude" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-5.htm">1 Kings 8:5</a>). Zerubbabel had followed this example at the dedication of the second temple (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>); and we may presume that it was with victims that Eliashib and his brethren the priests had "sanctified" their portion of the wall soon after they completed it (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Nehemiah now completed the dedication of the entire circuit of the walls by sacrifices on a large scale. <span class="cmt_word">God had made them rejoice with great joy</span>. It is characteristic of Nehemiah to ascribe the universal joy, which another might well have claimed as his own work, to the Divine mercy and forethought, which had brought the matter of the wall to a prosperous and happy issue. <span class="cmt_word">The wives also and the children rejoiced</span>. It is seldom that the Jewish women are mentioned as taking that prominent position in joy, which naturally belonged to them in sorrow (<a href="../../par/judges/11-40.htm">Judges 11:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>, etc.). There is, however, one remarkable example of the kind, besides the present one - the rejoicing of the women after the passage through the Red Sea, under the leadership of Miriam (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off</span>.

NEHEMIAH'S ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TEMPLE SERVICE, AND APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-47</a>). The good resolutions of the people at the time of the renewal of the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-28.htm">Nehemiah 10:28-39</a>) would have borne comparatively little fruit had they not been seconded and rendered effective by formal action on the part of the civil authority. The people, in the first flush of their zeal, had bound themselves to undertake the conveyance of the tithes, firstfruits, and free-will offerings from the country districts to Jerusalem, and the deposition of them in the temple treasuries (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37-39</a>). But in practice this was found too great a burthen (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>). Nehemiah therefore appointed special officers to collect the tithes and other dues throughout the entire territory, and to bring them to Jerusalem, and lay them up in the proper chambers (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>). Over the chambers he appointed treasurers, whose duty it was, not only to collect the ecclesiastical dues, but also to distribute the proceeds among the individuals entitled to share in them (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Nehemiah 13:13</a>). Having in this way provided for the sustenance of the clerical body, he was able to insist on their regular performance of all their duties; and the success of his arrangements was such, that under him the temple service was restored, not merely to the condition established by Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a>), but to one not markedly different from that which had been attained in the time of David and Asaph (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 46). The priests, Levites, singers, and porters respectively performed their duties to his satisfaction, purifying themselves, and taking the service in their turns, "according to the commandment of David and Solomon" (ibid. ver. 45).

On these adjuncts of the temple, see the comment on Nehemiah 10:37. The "treasures" themselves consisted chiefly of tithes (including corn, wine, and oil), firstfruits, and free-will offerings.

The general satisfaction of the people with their spiritual guides led them to increase their contributions beyond the requirements of the law; whence there was at this time special need of treasurers and treasuries - abundant occupation for the one, and abundant material requiring to be stored in the other.

Maintaining the ward of their God is serving regularly in the temple at the times appointed; maintaining the ward of the purification is observing the rules for the purifying of the holy things which had been laid down by David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>).

This verse is exegetical of the clause in ver. 45, "according to the commandment of David."

It is questioned whether the high priest of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> is meant, and noted that the expression used - "the priest"- does not always designate "the high priest" (see ver. 13); but the important charge said to have been assigned to him, the alliance with so great a man as Tobiah, and the important step taken, the assignment to a heathen of a residence within the temple precincts, imply a man of high authority, and suit better with the high priest than with any one of lower rank. Moreover, the fact that Eliashib's leanings were towards the enemies of Nehemiah accounts for his disappearance from the history from <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> to <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Having the oversight</span>. Literally, "being set over" - perhaps by Nehemiah, who seems to have claimed the appointment to all offices about the temple which were not purely spiritual. (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Nehemiah 13:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the chamber</span>. The word "chamber" (<span class="accented">lishkah</span>) is here used in a <span class="accented">collective</span> sense of the entire building containing the many "chambers" or "treasuries" of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-9.htm">Nehemiah 13:9, 12, 13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Was allied unto Tobiah</span>. <span class="accented">Karob</span>, the word translated "allied," means "<span class="accented">a</span> relation," either by blood or marriage.

He (Eliashib) had prepared (or made) for him (Tobiah) a great chamber - probably by throwing into one several of the old store-chambers. <span class="cmt_word">The meat offerings</span>. The <span class="accented">minchah</span> consisted of fine flour seasoned with salt, and mixed with oil and frankincense. It was made into a sort of cake, but without leaven, and formed part of the daily morning and evening sacrifice, the Sabbath offerings, and most others. <span class="cmt_word">The frankincense</span>. Frankincense was a necessary ingredient in the incense which was offered twice a day on the "altar of incense" in the holy place (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>). As a rare foreign product, it had necessarily to be kept in store. <span class="cmt_word">The vessels</span>. Sacred vessels, basins, and the like, not needed except on occasion of great gatherings. <span class="cmt_word">The offerings of the priests</span>. The portion of the offerings which belonged to the priests - "the tithe of the tithes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">But in all this <i>time</i> was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In all this time</span>. Literally, "during all this"- while all this was being done. The reference seems to be solely to the affair of Eliashib and Tobiah. <span class="cmt_word">Artaxerxes, king of Babylon</span>. The title "king of Babylon," which was certainly borne by Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius Hystaspis, may have continued in use down to the time of Nehemiah, or even later. If he visited Artaxerxes at Babylon, the court happening to be there at the time, he would naturally think and speak of him as "king of Babylon." <span class="cmt_word">After</span> <span class="cmt_word">certain days</span>. Literally, "at the end of days," which is thought to mean "<span class="accented">at</span> the expiration of a year." <span class="cmt_word">I obtained leave of the king</span>. Gesenius and Professor Lee render, "I <span class="accented">asked</span> leave of the king; Houbigant, Rambach, and others, "I was asked for from the king," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Jews asked to have me sent back to govern them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-7.htm">Nehemiah 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A chamber in the courts of the house of God</span>. It would seem by this expression that the chamber made over to Tobiah was not part of the main building of the temple, but a portion of some detached building belonging to the "courts." This, no doubt, made the desecration less flagrant, but was far from justifying it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-8.htm">Nehemiah 13:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore cast I forth all the household stuff</span>. Tobiah had furnished his "chamber" as a dwelling-house, filling it with "household stuff" of various kinds. Nehemiah, of his own authority, had the whole of it turned out of doors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-9.htm">Nehemiah 13:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers</span>. Regarding the sacred place as polluted by its conversion to secular uses, Nehemiah had it purified, and so reconsecrated. He then ordered the restoration to their former place of the various stores which had been removed to make room for Tobiah's furniture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a></div><div class="verse">And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given <i>them</i>: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites ... were fled</span>. What Nehemiah saw was that the Levites were absent, and "the house of God forsaken" (ver. 11). On inquiry, he found that the reason of their absence was the non-payment of the tithes. <span class="cmt_word">That did the work</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whose business it was to do the work of the house, or, in other words, conduct Divine service. <span class="cmt_word">Every one to his field</span>. Every Levite had a plot of ground, which he cultivated when not engaged in the work of the temple (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-3.htm">Joshua 21:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-11.htm">Nehemiah 13:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken?

While the guilt of profaning the temple lay especially with the priestly class, that of withholding the tithes was mainly chargeable on the "rulers," or "nobles." These persons, as wealthy landowners, had of course a pecuniary interest in keeping back the tithe. When they felt the control of a strong hand they made the payments regularly enough (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-12.htm">Nehemiah 13:12</a>); but no sooner was this control removed by Nehemiah's departure than they relapsed into the covetous habits in which they had indulged before he was made governor (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37</a>). The Church in all ages has suffered wrong from the cupidity of wealthy men among its members. <span class="cmt_word">Why is the house of God forsaken?</span> Why, contrarily to the distinct pledge given at the time of the renewal of the covenant (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a>), have you suffered the house of God to become a solitude, driving the Levites away from it by depriving them of their legal sustenance? <span class="cmt_word">I gathered them together</span>. Nehemiah brought the Levites back to the temple from their country residences, and re-established them in their proper offices. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-12.htm">Nehemiah 13:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</div><div class="comm">

It was perhaps now for the first time that special treasurers were provided to have the charge of the temple store-chambers, these having hitherto been under the superintendence of the high priest (ver. 4). The appointment mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a> is probably the same with this; and the entire duty of the treasurers is to be learnt by combining that passage with the present. They were to be both the collectors and the dispensers of the tithes. Of the four treasurers, one was a priest, one a Levite, one a layman of rank (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-22.htm">Nehemiah 10:22</a>), and one a professional scribe. This last, <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>, is perhaps to be identified with the "Zidkijah" of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, who appears to have been Nehemiah's private secretary (see the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their brethren</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the priests and Levites, brethren of Shelemiah and Pedaiah.

The Jews have always reckoned their days from sunset to sunset, grounding their practice on the account of the Creation given in the first chapter of Genesis, where "the evening and the morning" arc said to constitute each of the six days. There was also a special command that the "sabbath" of the great day of atonement should be kept "from even to even" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-32.htm">Leviticus 23:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I commanded that the gates should be shut</span>. The gates would as a matter of course have been shut at sunset. Nehemiah required that the closing should take place some half-hour earlier, when the shadows were lengthening, and the day was drawing towards a close. He regarded it as a sort of desecration of the sabbath to carry on secular work to the last allowable moment. <span class="cmt_word">Some of my servants</span>.

There is a reference to the first three verses of the present chapter, which had introduced the subject of the mixed marriages.

We look in vain for any distinct "covenant" which the priestly order broke by allying itself with the heathen, or indeed for any special law forbidding the priests to take heathen wives, which was not equally binding upon laymen. But Nehemiah feels that every sin is worse in a priest than in one who is not a priest; that a priest who contracts a pollution "pollutes the priesthood;" and that there is a tacit covenant by which priests and Levites bind themselves to holiness of life more absolutely and definitely than others.

The word Chisleu, or rather Kislev, is probably Persian. It was unknown to the Jews before the captivity, and is found only in this passage and in <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a>, where Kislev is said to be "the ninth month," corresponding nearly to our December. <span class="cmt_word">The twentieth year</span>. The twentieth regnal year of Artaxerxes (Longimanus) is intended (see ch. 2:1).

It was situated in the fertile plain east of the Lower Tigris, and lay on or near the river Choaspes, probably at the spot now known as <span class="accented">Sus</span>, or <span class="accented">Shush.</span> Remains of the palace were discovered by the expedition under Sir Fenwick Williams in the year 1852, and have been graphically described by Mr. Loftus ('Chaldaea and Susiana,' pp. 373-375). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <i>certain</i> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hanani, one of my brethren</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <i>are</i> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <i>is</i> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down</span>. It has been supposed, either that the demolition of the wall here referred to was quite recent, having occurred during the space of twelve years which intervenes between the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, or else that it belonged to a time of depression which followed shortly after the completion of the temple by Zerubbabel (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. pp. 120, 121, and 148, note 3, E. Tr.); but there is really no reason to believe that the demolition effected under the orders of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>) had ever hitherto been repaired, or the restoration of the wall even attempted. The Samaritan accusation in <a href="../../par/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12</a> falls short of a statement that the wall was restored, and, if it asserted the fact, would be insufficient authority for it. The supposition of Ewald, that "as soon as the city was rebuilt, the attempt <span class="accented">would be made</span> to fortify it" (p. 121, note 3), ignores the jealousy of the Persians and their power to step in and prevent a subject town from fortifying itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i>certain</i> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I heard these things, I sat down and wept</span>. The revelation of the actual condition of Jerusalem came upon Nehemiah with a shock. He had perhaps not thought much upon the subject before; he had had no means of exact information; he had supposed the city flourishing under the superintendence of Ezra, whose piety and patriotism were no doubt known to him. It was a bitter grief to him to find that his people were still "a reproach to their neighbours," laughed to scorn by those whose walls had never been destroyed, or who had been allowed to rebuild them. And he may have felt that his city, under the circumstances of the time, was in real danger. As Dean Stanley observes - "In those days rather one may say m those countries of disorder, a city without locked gates and lofty walls was no city at all" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, p. 124). A few years previously Egypt had been in revolt; she might revolt again, and carry her arms into Syria. Arab tribes from the desert might extend their raids into Judaea, and be tempted by the known value of the temple treasures to swoop upon the unwalled town. Such thoughts occurring to an excitable Oriental, produced not grief and anxiety merely, but a flood of tears (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fasted</span>. Fasting had become a frequent practice among the Jews during the captivity. Solemn fasts had been introduced on the anniversaries of the taking of Jerusalem, the burning of the temple, and the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). Fasting had also taken a prominent place in the devotions of individuals. Daniel fasted (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>); Esther fasted (<a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>); Ezra fasted (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>); and now Nehemiah fasted. On the grounds of natural piety out of which the practice arises, see the comment on Ezra 10:6. <span class="cmt_word">The God of heaven</span>. See the comment on Ezra 1:2. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, I beseech thee</span>. The opening of Nehemiah's prayer follows so closely the thoughts and words of Daniel's (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a>), that it is almost impossible to suppose that one of the two writers had not the words of the other before him. As there are no sufficient grounds for questioning the generally received date of Daniel's prophecy ( <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>), we must suppose Nehemiah familiar with his writings, and an admirer of their tone and spirit. In this verse he differs from Daniel only in substituting "Jehovah" for "Lord" (<span class="accented">Adonai</span>), and introducing his own favourite phrase "God of heaven." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both I and my father's house have sinned</span>. Ewald well observes, "In the prayer of Nehemiah the keynote is struck in the words, 'I and my father's house have sinned'" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 149, note 1). The desolation which he mourns is the result of the people's sins, and in those sins are included his own, and those of his ancestors. His own may not have been very grievous, but those of his fathers weigh upon him as if his own, and oppress his spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-7.htm">Nehemiah 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments</span>. The ordinances of the Law are frequently summed up under these three heads (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-31.htm">Deuteronomy 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-1.htm">Deuteronomy 11:1</a>, etc.); but it would be a mistake to regard them as constituting a logical division of the various precepts contained in the Pentateuch, or to suppose that every precept is to be referred absolutely to one or other of the three. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-8.htm">Nehemiah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <i>If</i> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye transgress</span>, etc. This is not a quotation, but a reference to the general sense of various passages, as, for instance, <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27-45</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-5</a>, etc. The sacred historians habitually refer to the older Scriptures in this way, quoting them in the spirit rather than in the letter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>if</i> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <i>yet</i> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-10.htm">Nehemiah 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Now these <i>are</i> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power</span>. It would be better to translate, "Whom thou didst redeem." The reference is especially to the deliverance from Egypt, which is so constantly spoken of as effected "with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, etc. ). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prosper thy servant this day</span>. "This day" does not perhaps mean more than "at this time"- in connection with this matter which is now in my thoughts. And grant him mercy in the sight of this man. "This man" is, of course, Artaxerxes, though as yet he has not been named. Nehemiah's thoughts have far outstripped his words. He has made up his mind that, in order to remove the reproach of Jerusalem, he must go there in person; that, to do so, he must obtain the king's permission; and that, to get his permission, he needs to be in very special favour with him. All depending on one man only, he has one man only in his mind, who becomes to him, therefore, "this man." <span class="cmt_word">I was the king's cupbearer</span>. Literally, "I was cupbearer to the king." Not his sole cupbearer, but one of many. He mentions the fact here, partly to explain the meaning of "this man" to the reader, partly because it was his office which would give him access to Artaxerxes, and enable him to profit by the royal "mercy" or favour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm"><title>Nehemiah 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/nehemiah/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/nehemiah/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/nehemiah/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../nehemiah/1.htm" title="Nehemiah 1">&#9668;</a> Nehemiah 2 <a href="../nehemiah/3.htm" title="Nehemiah 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that</i> wine <i>was</i> before him: and I took up the wine, and gave <i>it</i> unto the king.

The fourth month after Chisleu, corresponding nearly to our April. How it came about that Nehemiah did not put the king's favour to the proof until more than three months had gone by we can only conjecture. Perhaps the court had been absent from Susa, passing the winter at Babylon, as it sometimes did, and he had not accompanied it. Perhaps, though present at the court, he had not been called on to discharge his office, his turn not having arrived. Possibly, though performing his duties from time to time, he had found no opportunity of unbosoming himself, the king not having noticed his grief. He. may even have done his best to conceal it, for Persian subjects were expected to be perfectly happy in the presence of their king. He had probably formed no plan, but waited in the confident hope that God's providence would so order events, that some occasion would arise whereof he might take advantage. <span class="cmt_word">In the twentieth year of Artaxerxes</span>. Like Daniel, Zechariah, Haggai, and Ezra, Nehemiah dates events by the regnal year of the existing Persian king. His Artaxerxes is, by common consent, the same as Ezra's, and can scarcely be supposed to be any monarch but Longimanus, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 465</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 425</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence</span>. Other renderings have been proposed, but this is probably the true meaning. Hitherto I had always worn a cheerful countenance before him - now it was otherwise - my sorrow showed itself in spite of me. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore the king said unto me, Why <i>is</i> thy countenance sad, seeing thou <i>art</i> not sick? this <i>is</i> nothing <i>else</i> but sorrow of heart.

History puts him before us as a weak monarch, one who could compromise the royal dignity by making terms with a revolted subject, while he disgraced it by breaking faith with a conquered enemy. But if weak as a king, as a man he was kind-hearted and gentle. Few Persian monarchs would have been sufficiently interested in their attendants to notice whether they were sad or no; fewer still would have shown sympathy on such an occasion. A Xerxes might have ordered the culprit to instant execution. Longimanus feels compassion, and wishes to assuage the grief of his servant. <span class="cmt_word">Then I was very sore afraid</span>. Notwithstanding the king's kind and compassionate words, Nehemiah feels his danger. He has looked sad in the king's presence. He is about to ask permission to quit the court. These are both sins against the fundamental doctrine of Persian court life, that to bask in the light of the royal countenance is the height of felicity. Will the king be displeased, refuse his request, dismiss him from his post, cast him into prison, or will he pardon his rudeness and allow his request? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-3.htm">Nehemiah 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, <i>lieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">May the king live for ever</span>. A common form of Oriental compliment (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a>, etc. ), but said now with special intention to conciliate, and meant to express a deep interest in the royal life and person. <span class="cmt_word">The city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres</span>. We see by this that Nehemiah's family must have belonged to the capital. The Persians, like the Jews, had a great respect for the tomb, and regarded its violation with horror. Artaxerxes would naturally sympathise with the wish of his follower to give security to the city where his ancestors were interred. It would seem that the Persians generally at this time (Herod., 1:140), the kings certainly ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 231, second edition), buried their dead. <span class="cmt_word">Lieth waste</span>. Nehemiah's warmth of feeling exaggerates the fact; but he may have been unconscious of the exaggeration. He repeats the phrase to the chief men of Jerusalem after making his survey of the wall (ver. 17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?</span> Artaxerxes understood that a complaint was contained in Nehemiah's speech, and that he must have a request to make. With gracious kindliness he facilitates its utterance. <span class="cmt_word">So I prayed to the God of heaven.</span> Nehemiah was emphatically a man of prayer. In every danger, in every difficulty, still more at any crisis, prayer rose to his lips (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14</a>, etc.). Sometimes, as now, the prayer was offered silently and swiftly.

Nothing more is known of her besides this mention, and the fact that she died on the same day as her husband. (The Septuagint rendering of <span class="accented">hashegal</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> is wrong.) <span class="cmt_word">Sitting by him</span>. Not an unusual circumstance. Though, when the monarch entertained guests, the queen remained in her private apartments (<a href="../../par/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9-12</a>), yet on other occasions she frequently took her meals with him ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">I set him a time</span>. Nehemiah probably mentioned some such time as a year, or two years - such a space as would suffice for the double journey, and the restoration of the fortifications. He stayed away, however, as he tells us (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>), twelve years, obtaining no doubt from time to time an extension of his leave (Bertheau). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river</span>.

And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's forest</span>. Patrick supposes the forest on Mount Lebanon to be intended; but Nehemiah would scarcely have desired to transport timber for ordinary building purposes from such a distance. Moreover, the word used is one not applicable to a natural forest, but only to a park, or pleasure-ground planted with trees, and surrounded by a fence or wall. The word is <span class="accented">pardes</span>, the Hebrew representative of that Persian term which the Greeks rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whence our "paradise." We must understand a royal park in the vicinity of Jerusalem, of which a Jew, Asaph, was the keeper. <span class="cmt_word">The palace which appertained to the house</span>. The "house" here spoken of is undoubtedly the temple; and the <span class="accented">birah</span>, appertaining to it is, almost certainly, the fortress at the north-west angle of the temple area, which at once commanded and protected it. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:11, &sect; 4) that this fortress was called <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> originally. In Roman times it was known as the "Turris Antonia." <span class="cmt_word">The house that I shall enter into</span>. The governor's residence. Nehemiah assumes that the powers for which he asks involve his being appointed governor of Judaea. The king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. Through God's special favour towards me, the king was induced to grant my request. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:9-11 NEHEMIAH'S JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-9.htm">Nehemiah 3:9-11</a>). On his way to Jerusalem, Nehemiah would pass through the provinces of various Persian satraps and governors. To those beyond the Euphrates he carried letters, which he took care to deliver, though by doing so he aroused the hostility of San-ballat. Being accompanied by an escort of Persian soldiers, he experienced neither difficulty nor danger by the way, but effected his journey in about three months. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-9.htm">Nehemiah 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I came to the governors beyond the river</span>. Josephus gives the name of the satrap, of Syria at this time as Adieus ('Ant. Jud., 11:5, &sect; 6, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>), but it is uncertain on what authority. The other "governors" he calls Hipparchs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard <i>of it</i>, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sanballat</span>. According to Josephus, Sanballat was "satrap of Samaria" under the Persians, and by descent a Cuthaean ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:7, &sect; 2). He was probably included among the governors to whom Nehemiah had brought letters, and learnt the fact that "a man was come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel" by the delivery of the letters to him. The <span class="cmt_word">Horonite</span>, Born, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at one of the two Beth-horons, the upper or the lower, mentioned in Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 5</a>) as belonging to Ephraim, and now under Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite</span>. It has been usual to regard Tobiah as a native chief of the Ammonites, who, after having been a page or other servant at the Persian court, had been made head of the nation. But it seems to be quite as likely that he was a servant of Sanballat's, who stood high in his favour, gave him counsel, and was perhaps his secretary (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It grieved them exceedingly</span>. From the time that Zerub-babel rejected the co-operation of the Samaritans in the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>), an enmity set in between the two peoples which continued till the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. The two capitals were too near not to be rivals; and the greater (general) prosperity of Jerusalem made Samaria the bitterer adversary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I... was there three days</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>. After the long journey, three days of rest were necessary. STEPS TAKEN BY NEHEMIAH PRELIMINARY TO HIS BUILDING OF THE WALL, AND FIRST APPEARANCE OF OPPOSITION (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12-20</a>). Hitherto Nehemiah had communicated his purpose to no one but the king and queen of Persia. He expected opposition, and resolved to baffle his opponents, as long as possible, by concealing his exact designs. Even when further concealment was on the point of becoming impossible, he made his survey of the wall by night, that it might escape observation. At last, the time for action being come, he was obliged to lay the matter before the head men of the city (ver. 17), whom he easily persuaded when he assured them of Artaxerxes' consent and goodwill Preparations then began to be made; and immediately murmurs of opposition arose. Three opponents are now spoken of - Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arabian, Geshem or Gashmu, not previously mentioned. These persons appear to have sent a formal message to the authorities of Jerualem (ver. 19), taxing them with an intention to rebel Nehemiah made no direct reply to this charge, but boldly stated his resolve to "arise and build," and denied Sanballat's right to interfere with him (ver. 20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I <i>any</i> man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither <i>was there any</i> beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some few men with me</span>. All the arrangements are made to avoid notice. Nehemiah goes out <span class="accented">by night</span>, with <span class="accented">few</span> attendants, and with only one beast. He is anxious to see with his own eyes what is the extent of the repair needed, but wishes as few as possible to know of his proceedings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The valley gate</span>. A gate on the western or south-western side of Jerusalem, opening towards the valley of Hinnom. There are no means of fixing its exact position. It was one of those which Uzziah fortified (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The dragon well</span>. Dean Stanley suggests that "the dragon well" is the spring known generally as "the pool of Siloam," and that the legend, which describes the intermittent flow of the Siloam water as produced by the opening and closing of a dragon s mouth, had already sprung up ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, p. 125); but the Siloam spring seems to lie too far to the eastward to suit the present passage, and is most likely represented by the "king's pool" of ver. 14. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">dung port</span>. "The gate outside of which lay the piles of the sweepings and offscourings of the streets" ('Stanley,' 1. s.c.); situated towards the middle of the southern wall 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-14.htm">Nehemiah 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but <i>there was</i> no place for the beast <i>that was</i> under me to pass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gate of the fountain</span>. A gate near the pool of Siloam (which, though bearing that name in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>, seems to be here called "the king's pool" ); perhaps the "gate between two walls of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a><span class="cmt_word">. There was no place for the beast that was under me to pass</span>. The accumulated rubbish blocked the way. The animal could not proceed.

"The brook Kidron," which skirted the city on the east. From this he would be able to "look up at the eastern wall" along its whole length, and see its condition. Following the brook, he was brought to the north-eastern angle of the city; on reaching which he seems to have <span class="cmt_word">"turned back"</span> towards the point from which he had started, and skirting the northern wall, to have <span class="cmt_word">re-entered by the gate of the valley</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told <i>it</i> to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rulers</span>. On Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem he found no single individual exercising authority, but a number of persons, a sort of town-council, whom he calls <span class="accented">khorim</span> and <span class="accented">saganim.</span> It is not clear that he made his commission known to them at first, or indeed that he divulged it before the interview mentioned in vers. 17 and 18. <span class="cmt_word">The rest that did the work</span> This seems to be said by anticipation, and to mean those who subsequently built the wall. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we <i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I unto them</span>. Ewald boldly assumes that this happened the next day; but there is nothing to show that it was so soon. The original contains, no note of time - not even the word "then." Nehemiah simply says, "And I said to them." <span class="cmt_word">The distress</span>. Or "affliction," as the word is translated in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>.

This, however, would scarcely have had any great effect had he not been able to appeal further to <span class="cmt_word">the king's words that he had spoken</span>. These words clearly contained permission to rebuild the wall, and took away the danger of their so doing being regarded as an act of rebellion <span class="accented">by the Persians.</span> What others might think was not of very much account. <span class="cmt_word">And they said, Let us rise up and build</span>. Nehemiah's address had all the effect he hoped for from it. He was anxious to carry the nation with him, and induce them, one and. all, to engage heartily in the work, which must be accomplished, if it was to be accomplished at all, by something like a burst of enthusiasm. Such a burst he evokes, and its result is seen in the next chapter. Almost the whole people came forward, and set to work with zeal <span class="cmt_word">So they strengthened their hands for this good work</span>. The original is briefer, and more emphatic - "And they strengthened their hands for good." They embraced the good cause, took the good part, set themselves to work heartily on the right side.

Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem are united so closely, and act so much together (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1, 2, 6, 12, 14</a>), that it is difficult to suppose them to be three chieftains residing on three sides of Judaea, the north, the east, and the south, merely holding diplomatic intercourse with each other, which is the ordinary idea. Note that Tobiah is present with Sanballat in Samaria on one occasion (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>), and that Geshem and Sanballat propose a joint interview with Nehemiah on another (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They laughed us to scorn, and said</span>.

They are told that they have no part in Jerusalem, no right, not even so much as a place in the recollections of the inhabitants. Their interference is officious, impertinent - what have they to do with Nehemiah, or the Israelites, or Jerusalem? Let them be content to manage the affairs of their own idolatrous community, and not trouble the worshippers of the true God. Nehemiah avoids opposition by concealment as long as he can; but when opposition nevertheless appears, he meets it with defiance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm"><title>Nehemiah 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/nehemiah/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/nehemiah/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/nehemiah/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../nehemiah/2.htm" title="Nehemiah 2">&#9668;</a> Nehemiah 3 <a href="../nehemiah/4.htm" title="Nehemiah 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up</span>. It is satisfactory to find Eliashib the high priest taking the part which befitted him on this occasion. Subsequently we find him "allied by marriage to Tobiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), and guilty of a profanation of the temple (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 5). By the line of high priests given in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of the Jeshua who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his brethren</span>. The priests generally. Compare ver. 28, which shows that the priests undertook a portion of the eastern wall, besides the work here mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Builded the sheep gate</span>. The "sheep gate" appears to have been a gate in the eastern wall, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of St. John (John %;2), which was close to the pool of Bethesda. By this gate were brought in the sheep needed for sacrifice, which were then washed in the adjoining pool, and conveyed from it into the temple area, whereon the pool abuts. The priests dwelt principally in this portion of the city. <span class="cmt_word">They sanctified it</span>. This appears to have been a dedication quite distinct from that which is described in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>. The priests, having completed the rebuilding of the sheep gate, and of the wall extending from it northwards as far as the tower of Hananeel, anticipated the general dedication by a special one, which "sanctified," or consecrated, their own portion of the wall Thus a sacred character was impressed on the work at the earliest possible moment, and it was placed under the protection of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Meah</span> (or rather Hammeah, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Hundred") and <span class="cmt_word">the tower of Hananeel</span> appear to have been situated almost at the same point of the wall. Perhaps they were opposite each other, like the towers in the walls of Babylon (Herod., 1:179).

It was a small place, and does not appear, either in the catalogue of those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-20.htm">Ezra 2:20-35</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25-38</a>), or in the census list of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles put not their necks to the work</span>. This imputation of blame has been thought out of harmony with the general narrative contained in the chapter, and various emendations have been proposed to remove the so-called difficulty. But it has really first to be shown that a difficulty exists. Surely it would have been more strange if there had been no opposition to Nehemiah's wishes - no withdrawal from the work, than if there were the amount of opposition that is recorded. And supposing opposition to be made, why should Nehemiah not notice it? In music, the force and value of harmonious notes is brought out by an occasional discord. A desire to do honour to those who deserved it would be quite compatible with a determination to brand with disgrace the undeserving. And the contrast would enhance the value of the praise. Thus, there is no reason for disturbing the existing text, nor for questioning its plain meaning. The upper classes at Tekoah, the <span class="accented">adirim</span> or "exalted, withdrew from the work, like oxen withdrawing their necks from the yoke, and stood aloof, leaving it to the common people to engage in it, or not, as they pleased. The common people were perhaps moved to the greater zeal by the defection of their natural leaders. They were among those who accomplished a double task, repairing a second portion of the wall (ver. 27) after having finished their first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The old gate</span> must either have corresponded to the modern "Damascus gate" or have been in its near neighbourhood.

Others translate - "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor across the river." But this can scarcely have been the fact, since Gibeon is mentioned among the re-occupied cities in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25</a>, and if Bethel was Jewish, as we know that it was from <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, Gibeon and Mizpah, which were nearer Jerusalem, cannot have remained Syrian. Altogether, there is no reason to dispute the commonly received rendering, since Nehemiah again uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> in ver. 32, and the governor of Syria may well have had a "throne," or tribunal, at Jerusalem, which was usually under his jurisdiction, though exempted from his authority under the existing <span class="accented">regime</span>.

Bertheau suggests that Nehemiah merely means to note that the distance between the two gates, the Valley and the Dung gate, was a thousand cubits, and that he says nothing of the repairs because no repairs were needed.

He rapidly accomplished the task first set him, the mention of which must have accidentally fallen out (see the comment on ver. 11), and now undertook a "second piece," which extended from the north-western angle of the inner wall to the door of the high priest's house.

In the original it is uncertain whether the word translated "high" belongs to "tower" or "house." Most commentators attach it to "tower." The "king's house" of this place can be nothing but the old palace of David, which was in this quarter, while Solomon's was on the opposite, or western, hill This palace, like Solomon s (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>), would naturally have its <span class="cmt_word">prison</span>, which would stand in its own <span class="cmt_word">court</span>.

Ophel was "the long, narrowish, rounded spur or promontory which intervenes between the central valley of Jerusalem (the Tyropoeon) and the Kidron, or Valley of Jehoshaphat" (Grove). The Nethinims, who had their dwellings on this spur, were set to fortify a portion of the eastern circuit, but apparently restored not so much their own wall as that which lay north of it, at the edge of the present Haram area. Here must have been <span class="cmt_word">the water gate</span>, which carried off the superfluous water from the temple reservoirs; and here was <span class="cmt_word">the great tower that lieth out</span>, whose foundations have been recently discovered.

A Hanun has been mentioned (ver. 13) among the leaders of the working parties, and also a Hananiah (ver. 8); but they were not coupled together; and it may well be questioned whether either is identical with his namesake of this verse.

Some understand by this a Persian garrison, stationed in Samaria under its own commander, with which Sanballat had influence (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 153), but there is no real ground for such a supposition. <a href="../../par/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, belongs probably to David's time; and as Samaria had doubtless its own native force of armed citizens, who were Sanballat's subjects, it is quite unnecessary to suppose that he addressed himself to any other "army" than this. The Persians would maintain a force in Damascus, but scarcely in Samaria; and Persian soldiers, had there been any in that city, would have been more likely to support a royal cupbearer than a petty governor with no influence at court. We can really only explain the disturbed state of things and approach to open hostility which appears in Nehemiah's narrative, by the weakness of Persia in these parts, and the consequent power of the native races to act pretty much as they pleased - even to the extent of making war one upon another<span class="cmt_word">. Will they fortify themselves?</span> No other rendering is tenable. Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 3. p. 154, note 5)defends it successfully<span class="cmt_word">. Will they sacrifice?

It is assumed that they will begin by offering a sacrifice to inaugurate their work. <span class="cmt_word">Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</span> Rather, "Will they revive the burnt stones (the stones that are burned) out of the heaps of the rubbish?" Will they do what is im-possible-solidify and make into real stone the calcined and crumbling blocks which are all that they will find in the heaps of rubbish? If not, how are they to procure material?

The presence of Tobiah on this occasion, before the alliance was made with the Ammonites (ver. 8), is a strong indication that his position was not one of independent authority, but of dependence upon Sanballat.

Before men were taught to "love their enemies," and "bless those that cursed them" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>), they gave vent to their natural feelings of anger and indignation by the utterance of maledictions. Nehemiah's spirit was hot and hasty; and as he records of himself (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-25.htm">Nehemiah 13:25</a>) that he "cursed" certain Jews who had taken foreign wives, so it is not to be wondered at that he uttered imprecations against his persistent enemies.

Observe that Tobiah is here quite separated from the nation of the Ammonites, and in no way represented as their leader. Jealousy of Jerusalem on the part of the Ammonites and Philistines is quite natural; and, if the Arabs are the Edomites, their opposition would be equally a matter of course (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10, 14</a>); but the Edomites are not called Arabs in Scripture, nor do Arabs appear very often among the enemies of the Jews. It has been suggested that the "Arabians" here mentioned are the descendants of a colony which Sargon planted in Samaria itself. This, of course, is possible; but they may perhaps have been one of the desert tribes, induced to come forward by the hope of plunder (Ewald), and influenced by the Ammonites, their neighbours.

But it is suspected that there is a corruption of the original words of Nehemiah, and that what he wrote was, that these Jews came repeatedly to Jerusalem and warned him of the enemy's designs.

That no conflict followed would seem to show, that "when the enemy approached, and saw from a distance the whole people awaiting them in perfect equipment, order, and spirit," they lost heart and "turned back" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 155). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, which is great and terrible</span>.

So the Vulgate: "Unnsquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum;" but it is at least doubtful whether the Hebrew words can possibly have this meaning. The most natural and literal sense of them is that given by Maurer and Rambach - "Each man's weapon was his water;" the supposed connection of the clause with the preceding being, "No one took off his clothes," not even for the bath  - no one bathed; "a man's only bath was his weapon." Some critics, however, defend the rendering of the A. V.; others take the words in the same way, but explain the term "water" differently, of a natural want (Ewald, Stanley); while many regard the text as unsound, and propose emendations. None, however, that has as yet been proposed is satisfactory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm"><title>Nehemiah 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/nehemiah/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/nehemiah/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/nehemiah/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../nehemiah/4.htm" title="Nehemiah 4">&#9668;</a> Nehemiah 5 <a href="../nehemiah/6.htm" title="Nehemiah 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A great cry</span>.

Some, who could not say that their families were large, claimed relief on account, as it would seem, not so much of a present as of a past famine, which had forced them to mortgage their fields, vineyards, and houses.

Judaea, like other Persian provinces, had to pay a tribute, partly in money and partly in kind, yearly to the Persian monarch (see the comment on Ezra 4:13); but there is no reason to believe that this burthen was generally felt as oppressive, nor that it was heavier in Judaea than elsewhere. But by the very poor even a small amount of direct taxation is felt as a grievance; and the necessity of meeting the demands of the tax-gatherer was in the ancient world often the turning-point, which compelled the contracting of a debt (Liv., 2:23); and so it seems to have been with these complainants,

It is not clear that the letter of the law was infringed, unless it were in the matter of taking interest (ver. 11), of which the people had not complained. That men might sell their daughters to be concubines or secondary wives is clear from <a href="../../par/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; and it is therefore probable that they might sell their sons for servants. But the servitude might only be for six years (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>); and if a jubilee year occurred before the sexennial period was out, the service was ended (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). Land too might be either mortgaged or sold (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. vers. 14-16), but under the condition that it returned to the seller, or at any rate to his tribe, in the jubilee year (ibid. vers. 10, 13). The spirit, however, of the law - the command, "Ye shall not oppress one another" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 14, 17) - was transgressed by the proceedings of the rich men. It was their duty in a time of scarcity not to press hard upon their poorer brethren, but freely to alleviate their necessities. Nehemiah, his near relations, and his followers had done so to the utmost of their power (ver. 10, with the comment). The rich men had acted differently, and made all the profit that they could out of the need of their fellow-countrymen. Hence Nehemiah's anger. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.

He therefore translates, "I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye <span class="accented">lend upon pledge</span>." <span class="cmt_word">I set a great assembly against them</span>. It is evident that Nehemiah's rebuke had no effect. The nobles gave him no reason to think that they would change their conduct. He was therefore compelled to bring the matter before the people; not that they had any legal power, but he felt that the nobles might be ashamed or afraid to continue their oppression when it was openly denounced by the chief civil ruler in the hearing of a great assembly of their countrymen.

"We," here, may be either "we Jews of the captivity," in contrast with "you who have long returned from it," or "we of my house and household" (equivalent to the "I, my brethren, and my servants" of ver. 10), in contrast with "you rich Jews not of my household."

Cause your brethren to be sold into slavery? And not to heathen masters, but to men of their own nation, unto us? Roman creditors, if they sold their debtor slaves, were required by law to sell them across the Tiber - to men of a different race. It was felt to add to the indignity of the slave condition that one should have to serve one's own countryman, recently one's equal and (perhaps) acquaintance. <span class="cmt_word">They held their peace, and found nothing to answer</span>.

Will ye not cease to oppress your brethren? Will ye not deal kindly and gently with them? Because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies. If the mere fear of God, the desire to escape his displeasure and win his approval, is not enough, will not the thought of the light in which you will appear to the heathen influence you? You make a profession of religion; you claim to be actuated by high motives; to be merciful, compassionate, and self-denying. If they see you as keen after gain as any of themselves, as regardless of others, as pitiless and oppressive, what a reproach will not this bring on your religion! What a proof will it not seem to be that you are no better than your neighbours, and your religion, therefore, no whit superior to theirs!

"We will restore them," they said, "<span class="cmt_word">and will</span> (in future) <span class="cmt_word">require nothing of them, neither interest nor security, but will do as thou sayest</span>."

Even the taking of the oath did not seem sufficient to the prudent governor. He would strengthen the oath by a malediction, and a malediction accompanied by a symbolical act, to render it the more impressive. Among the nations of antiquity few things were so much dreaded as falling under a curse. The maledictions of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-16.htm">Deuteronomy 28:16-44</a> were the supreme sanction which Moses devised for the Law, whereof he was the promulgator. Curses protected the tombs and inscriptions of the Assyrian and Persian kings, the contracts of the Babylonians, and the treaties of most nations. Nehemiah's curse is an unusual one, but very clear and intelligible. He prays that whosoever departs from his promise given may be cast forth a homeless wanderer, emptied of all his possessions, as empty as the fold in his own dress, which he first gathers into a sort of bag or pocket, and then throws from him and so empties out. To this the assembly responded by a hearty "Amen," and then <span class="cmt_word">praised the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> for the happy ending of the whole affair; in which they piously traced the directing and over-ruling hand of God, "restraining the fierceness of men," and "turning it to his praise" (<a href="../../par/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a> - Prayer-Book version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:14-19 GENERAL ACCOUNT OF NEHEMIAH'S GOVERNMENT (vers. 14-19). Having given this account of the internal difficulties which threatened to put a stop to the building of the wall before it was well begun, and been led in the course of it to speak of the poverty and sufferings of the common people, Nehemiah not unnaturally goes on to inform us of the methods by which in his general government he endeavoured to alleviate the distress, or at any rate to avoid adding to the burthens which pressed upon the poorer classes. From the time that he entered upon his office, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes,  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, to the time of his writing this portion of his Book, in the thirty-second year of the same king,  <span class="date">B.C. 432</span>, he had lived entirely at his own expense, requiring no contributions from the people, either in provisions or money, for the support of himself or his court (ver. 14). This was quite contrary to the previous practice of Jewish governors (ver. 15), and indeed of Oriental governors generally, whether under the Persian system or any other, such persons almost universally taxing their provinces, sometimes very heavily, for their current expenses, and often accumulating princely fortunes by their exactions. Nehemiah had also maintained a noble hospitality, of which he may be excused for being a little proud, during these twelve years of his governorship, entertaining daily at his table 150 of the chief inhabitants of Jerusalem, besides many foreign Jews who from time to time came on visits to the Judaean capital (vers. 17, 18). It is conjectured that he was able to take this course, and spend so largely without receiving any income from his province, because he retained his place of cupbearer, and as such drew a large salary from the Persian court (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 150, E. Tr.). However this may have been, he certainly disbursed large sums of money in Jerusalem, and must have done something to alleviate the general poverty by his lavish expenditure. He takes credit, further, for giving the services of his private attendants to the work of the wall during the whole time that it was in building (ver. 16), and for having abstained from the purchase of any land, when, through the general poverty, it might have been bought at a low price from those who were anxious to part with it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). HIS conduct beyond a doubt stood in the strongest contrast with that of the ordinary Persian satrap, or other governor, and we cannot be surprised that he looked on it with some complacency. He felt that he had done much for his people. He looked, however, for his reward not to them, not to man, but to God; and desired that his reward should be not present gratitude and thanks, not even posthumous fame, but God's approval and remembrance only (ver. 19). "Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."

The oppression exercised by the domestics and other hangers-on of rulers is often worse than their own.

The bondage intended must be that under the Persian crown, since neither the labour at the wall nor the oppression of the creditors lasted during the twelve years that Nehemiah was governor.

As Butler observes ('Analogy,' Part I. ch. 3.), the sense of good and ill desert is inseparably connected with an expectation of reward or punishment, and so with the notion of a future life, since neither are the righteous adequately rewarded nor the wicked adequately punished in this life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm"><title>Nehemiah 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/nehemiah/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/nehemiah/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/nehemiah/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../nehemiah/5.htm" title="Nehemiah 5">&#9668;</a> Nehemiah 6 <a href="../nehemiah/7.htm" title="Nehemiah 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <i>that</i> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian heard.</span> Literally, "When it was heard by Sanballat and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian."

This may appear to contradict <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1, 3, 6, 13</a>, etc. But the account of the building in ch. 3. is carried on to the completion of the whole work, the object there being to state by whom the different parts were done, and not at what time.

Dean Stanley compares Becket's noble words, - "I will not turn the cathedral into a castle," - but the parallel is not close. Nehemiah feels, not that he would profane the temple by making it into a place of refuge, but that he would break the law by simply entering it. Ewald shows that he has caught the point of the objection when he says, "Nehemiah thought that, as a <span class="accented">layman</span>, he must not break the Divine command by entering the sanctuary itself" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157).

I reflected on the whole matter, and came to the conclusion that, though he might be a prophet, he had not on this occasion exercised his prophetical office - he had not declared to me God's will (compare the case of the "old prophet," <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11-18</a>). And I was right, "for (in fact) he had <span class="cmt_word">pronounced this prophecy against me,</span> because <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him</span>." "Tobiah and Sanballat" here - not "Sanballat and Tobiah," as elsewhere (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>), because Tobiah was no doubt the immediate briber, Sanballat merely furnishing the funds.

Nehemiah's influence depended greatly on the weight of his moral character. One false step, and he would have been lost; his influence would have been gone; and the work on which his heart was set would have come to nought.

She has been supposed to have succumbed to a bribe, like Shemaiah (Ewald); but this is wholly uncertain. We only know that, together with certain <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> prophets, she endeavoured to "put Nehemiah in fear." It is clear that she was unsuccessful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days</span>. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:5, &sect; 8), the work of restoration occupied two years and four months, or 840 days, instead of fifty-two. And this period has been thought so much more probable than the smaller one, that moderns generally have accepted it, while some have even proposed to alter our present text of Nehemiah by the insertion of <span class="accented">u-shnathayim</span>, "and two years," at the end of this verse (Ewald). But the authority of Josephus on matters of remote history is so small, and the whole account of Nehemiah is so harmonious and consistent with itself, that alteration seems quite unnecessary. Nehemiah leaves Susa in Nisan, probably towards the middle or close of the month, for his preparations must have taken him some time. He would be likely to be nearly three months on his journey, and would thus reach Jerusalem about the middle of July - say July 15. He then rested three days, surveyed the wall, laid his plan before the nobles, arranged the working parties, and set to work. It was his object to hasten matters as much as possible; and he may well have commenced the rebuilding within ten days of his arrival. Fifty-two days from July 25 would bring him to Sept. 15, which corresponds, as nearly as may be, to the 25th of Elul. There is no difficulty in supposing that the wall could have been repaired in this space. The materials were ready at hand; the working parties were numerous; the workmen full of zeal. If we estimate the circumference of the wall at four miles, which is probably beyond the truth, and the working parties at forty-two (Ewald), it will follow that each party had, on the average, to repair 168 yards, or at the rate of between three and four yards a day. There was probably no work done on the sabbaths, and there may have been one or two days of interruption, when attack seemed imminent (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-15</a>); but otherwise the work was carried on without pause from early dawn to dark (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 21). The wall attained to half its height in a very short time (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 6), - there was then a brief interruption,  - after which came the main work of completing the entire circuit to its full height. It is possible that the fifty-two days are counted from the "return to work (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 15).

The Samaritans, the Ammonites, the Ashdodites, and the Arabians under Oeshem are the special "enemies" here spoken cf.

The porters and the singers were themselves Levites, but are often distinguished from their brethren, who had no such special office (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-42, 70</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/7-24.htm">Ezra 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43-45, 73</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-28.htm">Nehemiah 10:28</a>, etc.).

This appointment of two municipal officers to have charge of Jerusalem recalls the mention of two "rulers" in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-9.htm">Nehemiah 3:9, 12</a>, each of whom had authority-over half the district dependent on Jerusalem, and amounts to an "undesigned coincidence." <span class="cmt_word">The ruler of the palace</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-3.htm">Nehemiah 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar <i>them</i>: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one <i>to be</i> over against his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the gates be opened until the sun be hot</span>. The gates of towns in the East are usually opened at sunrise; but this cannot be the intention here. Some extra precaution is signified - not, however, so much as Dathe supposes, who renders <span class="accented">ante tempus meridianum</span>, "before noon;" but rather something intermediate between this and the ordinary practice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now the city <i>was</i> large and great: but the people <i>were</i> few therein, and the houses <i>were</i> not builded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city was large</span>. Literally, "broad every way<span class="cmt_word">." The houses were not builded</span>. Much of the city consisted of open spaces, in which no houses had been as yet built. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.

The census would show what proportion the country and town populations bore to each other, and would point out which were the places in the country districts that could best afford to lose a portion of their inhabitants. A census, therefore was resolved upon, and, according to ordinary Jewish usage (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17-47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-62</a>), it was genealogical. The tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi were numbered separately (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4-19</a>); and in the tribe of Judah the children of Pharez were reckoned apart from those of Zerah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4, 6</a>). No doubt the genealogical principle was acted upon throughout, but further evidence upon the point is wanting. It would seem to have been in the course of his preparations for this census, perhaps in searching for precedents, that Nehemiah found the "register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first," which is the subject of the next section. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:6-73 THE REGISTER OF THOSE WHO RETURNED UNDER ZERUBBABEL, WITH THE NUMBER OF THEIR SLAVES, BEASTS, AND OBLATIONS (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-73</a>). It is no doubt a curious circumstance that this list should occur twice, with no important differences, in the two Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Perhaps it was not in the original Ezra, that writer not having had the good fortune to "<span class="accented">find"</span> the document; but Nehemiah having "found" it and inserted it here, in connection with its discovery, a later arranger (Malachi?) removed it to the early part of Ezra, because it belonged to that portion of the Jewish history chronologically. The double record enables us to make out a more perfect catalogue than we could have obtained from either separately,-since there are corruptions in each which may be corrected by means of the other. See the comment which follows.

It makes against the view of Bishop Patrick and others, who regard Ezra's list as made at Babylon, some time before the final departure, and Nehemiah's as made at Jerusalem, after the arrival of the exiles, that the sum total is in each case the same (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>). Bishop Kennicott's theory, that the three lists - that of Ezra, that of Nehemiah, and that in the first of Esdras - had all one original, and that the existing differences proceed entirely from mistakes of the copyists, is the only tenable one. It is especially remarkable that the differences in the numbers of the three lists consist chiefly <span class="accented">in a single unit, a single ten, or a single hundred</span> - or in a five; less often in two units, or two tens, or two hundreds, or in a six - differences probably arising from the obliteration of one or two signs in a notation resembling the Roman or the Egyptian, where there are special signs for a thousand, a hundred, ten, five, and the unit, complex numbers being expressed by repetition of these, as 3438 in Latin inscriptions by MMMCCCCXXXVIII. Any fading of a sign in such a notation as this causes a copyist to diminish the amount by one, five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, etc. A fading of two sigmas may produce a diminution of two thousand, two hundred, twenty, two; or again of eleven hundred, one hundred and ten, one hundred and five, fifteen, eleven, six, and the like.

The Septuagint interposes, between "Jerusalem" and "Go forth," the words "And Esdras said," which would remove the difficulty; but it is difficult to understand how Ezra's name should have fallen out. Perhaps Houbigant is right in his suggestion of an emendation, by which the verse would run thus:  -  "And when they heard it, they proclaimed in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth," etc. Into the mountain. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the neighbouring mountain, the Mount of Olives. <span class="cmt_word">Pine branches</span>.

The same expression is used in <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, the meaning in each place being uncertain. Perhaps trees with thick, viscous leaves are intended. It is remark- able that two of the trees commanded in Leviticus are omitted, viz., the hadar and the "willow of the brook," while three not mentioned in Leviticus - the olive, oleaster, and myrtle - are added.

When it is said that since the days of Jeshua <span class="cmt_word">had not the children of Israel done so</span>, we must understand, not that there had been no celebration of the feast of tabernacles since that time - not even that there had been no celebration accompanied by "dwelling in booths," but only that there had been <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">such joyous and general</span> celebration of the festival (comp. what is said in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a> of the passover kept in Josiah's eighteenth year).

This is quoted from <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, which is perhaps a conscious reproduction of <a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>.

The land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon</span>. The Levites must have known that Sihon was king of Heshbon, and (if the text is sound) must have expressed themselves as they did, by way of rhetorical amplification; perhaps, however, the <span class="accented">van</span> after "Sihon" is the mistake of a copyist.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many years didst thou forbear them</span>. The ten tribes for 260 years from the revolt of Jeroboam, the remaining two tribes for 135 years longer. <span class="cmt_word">Testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy prophets</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>, where the phrase used is nearly the same, and see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</a>. There was a continual succession of prophets from the time of Solomon to, and through, the captivity. Besides those whose writings have come down to us, we find mention of Ahijah the Shilonite, Iddo the seer, Shemaiah the prophet, Hanani, Jehu the son of Hanani, Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah the son of Imlah, Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, Huldah, and (perhaps) Hosai. The guilt of the Jewish people was enormously increased by the fact that <span class="cmt_word">they would not give ear</span> to the exhortations constantly addressed to them by the messengers of God.

Compare <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Who keepest covenant and mercy</span>. This phrase, which occurs also in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, has apparently been derived from the Psalmist's words - "My <span class="accented">mercy</span> will I <span class="accented">keep</span> for him for evermore, and my <span class="accented">covenant</span> shall stand fast with him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the trouble</span>. Literally, "the weariness;" but the word is clearly used here for "suffering" generally. <span class="cmt_word">Since the time of the kings of Assyria</span>. The kings of Assyria, in the strictest sense of the word, had been God's original instrument for punishing his rebellious people. A king not mentioned in Holy Scripture tells us that he defeated Ahab, and forced Jehu to pay him tribute. Another (Pul) took tribute from Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19, 20</a>). A third (Tiglath. Pfieser) carried two tribes and a half into captivity (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). A fourth (Shalmaneser) laid siege to Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and a fifth (Sargon) took it. A sixth (Sennacherib) took all the fenced cities of Judah from Hezekiah, and forced him to buy the safety of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>). A seventh (Esar-haddon) had Manasseh brought as a prisoner to Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). Hence Isaiah calls the Assyrian monarch "the rod of God's anger" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).

See above, ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">The large and fat land</span>. Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>.

"The Persian monarchs derive a large revenue from our territory." The amount paid by Judaea is not known; but Syria, in which Judaea was included, paid annually in money 350 talents of silver (Herod. 3:91), or about &pound;90,000. There was also a further contribution in kind. <span class="cmt_word">They have dominion over our bodies</span>. They can impress us either as soldiers or sailors, and make us fight their battles for them.
