There is not much that is novel in the long expostulation, which mainly goes over ground covered in ch. 3, 6, and 7; but some new grounds are alleged as pleas for mercy, if not for justice. These are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he is God's gesture, and in the past (at any rate) has been the object of his care (vers. 8, 8-12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that God must be above judging as man judges (vers. 4, 5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that God knows his innocence (ver. 7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that he (Job) is entirely in God's power (ver. 7). In conclusion, Job begs for a little respite, a little time of comfort (ver. 20), before he descends into the darkness of the grave (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is weary of my life</span>. This is better than the marginal rendering, and well expresses the original. It strikes the key-note of the chapter. I will leave my complaint upon myself; rather, I <span class="accented">will give free course to my complaint over myself</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> I <span class="accented">will allow myself in the expression of it</span> (see the Revised Version). Job implies that hitherto he has put some restraint upon himself, but now he will give full and free expression to his feelings. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul (comp. <a href="../../par/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">do not pronounce me wicked</span> My friends, as they call themselves, have, one and all, condemned me: do not thou also condemn me. A touching appeal! <span class="cmt_word">Show me wherefore thou contendest with me</span>. One of Job's principal trials is the perplexity into which his unexampled sufferings have thrown him. He cannot understand why he has been singled out for such tremendous punishment, when he is not conscious to himself of any impiety or other heinous sin against God. So now, when he has resolved to vent all the bitterness of his soul, he ventures to ask the question - Why is he so tried? What has he done to make God his enemy? Wherefore does God fight against him continually? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is it</i> good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress?</span> Job assumes that he is oppressed. He has no conception that his sufferings are a purification (<a href="../../par/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>), intended to lead to the elevation and improvement of his moral character. He therefore asks - Is it worthy of God, is it good in him, is it compatible with his perfect excellence, to be an oppressor? It is a sort of <span class="accented">argumentum ad verecundiam</span> well enough between man and man, but quite out of place between a man and his Maker. <span class="cmt_word">That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>). This argument is more legitimate. God may be expected, not to despise, but to care for, the work of his own hands (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; 64:21; Isaiah 64:8; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). Every maker of a thing, as Aristotle says, loves his work, and naturally guards it, cares for it, and cherishes it<span class="cmt_word">. And shine upon the counsel of the wicked</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>). The prosperity of evil-doers must arise, Job thinks, from God allowing his countenance to shine upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-4.htm">Job 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</span> Notwithstanding the anthropomorphism of their language, the sacred writers are as fully aware as their modern critics of the immateriality of God, and the immense gap that separates his nature from human nature. It is on this that Job now dwells. God, being so much above man, having eyes that are not of flesh, and seeing not as man sooth, ought not to judge as man judges, with partiality, or prejudice, or even with extreme severity (ver. 6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-5.htm">Job 10:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Are</i> thy days as the days of man? <i>are</i> thy years as man's days,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are thy days as man's days?</span> In short-lived man, shortsightedness and prejudice are excusable, but not in one whose days are unlike man's days - whose "years endure throughout all generations" (Is. 102:24). Such a one ought to be above all human infirmity. <span class="cmt_word">Or thy years as man's days?</span> We should have expected "as man's <span class="accented">years."</span> But it marks the disparity more strongly to say, "Are thy years not greater in number even than man's [literally, 'a strong man's'] <span class="accented">days?"</span>

It seems to Job that God must have been "extreme to mark what he has done amiss" (<a href="../../par/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>), must have searched into  every corner of Ms life, and hunted out all his sins and shortcomings, to have been able to bring together against him a total commensurate or even approximately commensurate, with the punishment wherewith he has visited him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and <i>there is</i> none that can deliver out of thine hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou knowest that I am not wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">although thou knowest</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> the Revised Version). Conscious of his own integrity and faithfulness, Job feels that God too must know them; wherefore it seems to him all the harder that he should be made to suffer as if he were a "chief sinner." <span class="cmt_word">And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis excellent to have a giant's strength;<br />But tyrannous to use it like a giant."</span> Job's last ground of appeal is, that he is wholly at God s mercy, can look for no other deliverer, no other support or stay. Will not God, then, have pity, and "spare him a little, that he may recover his strength before he goes hence, and is no more seen "? (see Psalm 39:15; and comp. below, ver. 20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - Here we have an expansion of the plea in ver. 3, "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest despise the work of thine own hands?" Job appeals to God, not only as his Greater, but as, up to a certain time, his Supporter and Sustainer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12-16</a>, "My reins are thine; thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well My bones are not hid from thee, though I be made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in thy book were all my members written, which day by day were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them"). Canon Cook observes with much truth, "The processes of nature are always attributed in Scripture to the immediate action of God. The formation of every individual stands, in the language of the Holy Ghost, precisely on the same footing as that of the first man" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 50). Yet thou dost destroy me; literally, <span class="accented">devour me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17, 22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that thou hast fashioned me as day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Thou hast formed me, as a potter fashions a pot out of clay." This is scarcely a reference to <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, but rather an early use of what became a stock metaphor (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>:; 45:9; 64:8; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21</a>-2.9, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And wilt thou bring us into dust again?</span> After having fashioned me out of clay into a human form, wilt thou undo thine own work, crumble me into powder, and make me mere dust once more?

"To thee," that is, "I owe the delicate skin, which encloses my frame, and keeps it compact; to thee I owe the flesh whereof my frame chiefly consists." And hast fenced ms with bones and sinews; rather, <span class="accented">and hast woven me</span> or knit me to<span class="accented">gether</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>, where the same verb is used in the same sense). The idea is that the body altogether is woven and compacted of skin, bone, flesh, sinews, etc., into a delicate and elaborate garment (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2-4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast granted me life and favour</span>. God, besides providing Job with a body so delicately and marvellously constructed, had added the gift of "life" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), and also that of "favour," or loving providential care, whereby his life was preserved from infancy to manhood, and from manhood to a ripe age, in peace and prosperity. Job has not forgotten his former state of temporal happiness (<a href="../../par/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2-5</a>), nor ceased to feel gratitude to God for it (comp. <a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit</span>; or, <span class="accented">thy providence -</span> "thy continual care." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-13.htm">Job 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">And these <i>things</i> hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this <i>is</i> with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these things hast thou hid in thine heart</span>; rather, <span class="accented">get these things didst thou hide in thine heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Yet all the while, notwithstanding thy protecting care and gracious favour, thou wert hiding in thy heart the intention to bring all these evils upon me; thou couldst not but have known what thou wert about to do, though thou didst conceal thy intention, and allow no sign of it to escape thee." <span class="cmt_word">I know that this is with thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I know that this was with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this intention to destroy my happiness was "with thee" - present to thy thought - even while thou wert loading me with favour. Job's statement cannot be gainsaid; but it involves no real charge against God, who assigns men prosperity or suffering as is best for them at the time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I sin, then thou markest me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">if I sinned</span> <span class="accented">then thou didst observe me.</span> Thou tookest note of all my sins as I committed them, and laidest them up in thy memory. <span class="cmt_word">And thou wilt not acquit me</span>  <span class="cmt_word">from mine iniquity</span>. This record of my offences thou still hast against me, and I cannot expect that thou wilt acquit me of them. Without some one to atone for them, men cannot be acquitted of their offences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and <i>if</i> I be righteous, <i>yet</i> will I not lift up my head. <i>I am</i> full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I be wicked, woe unto me!</span> If, on the whole, this record of my sins be such that I am pronounced guilty before God, then I accept my doom. Woe unto me! I must submit to suffer. And if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. If, on the contrary, it be admitted that I have not sinned so grievously as to be pronounced unrighteous, even then I will not beast; I will not exalt myself; I will not hold up my head as if I were sinless. I am full of confusion. This clause should not be separated from the last. The sense runs on: "I will not lift up my head (being, as I am), full of confusion," or "of shame," through consciousness of my own imperfections (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore see thou mine affliction</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and seeing my afflictions.</span> The sense given in the Authorized Version is maintained by Rosenmuller, De Wette, Stanley Leathes, and Merx, and defended by Canon Cook; but opposed by Schultens, Professor Lee, and our Revisers. If we accept the views of these last, the whole passage will run thus: "If I be [pronounced] wicked, woe unto reel but if righteous, yet will I not lift up my head, being [as I am] full of confusion, and seeing my afflictions." Job still views his afflictions as signs of God's disfavour, and therefore proofs of his sinfulness.

Thou huntest me</span>. This passage is very obscure, and has been taken in several quite different senses. On the whole, it is not clear that any better meaning can be assigned to it than that of the Authorized Version, "For my affliction increaseth," or "is ever increasing. Thou huntest me;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou art continually pursuing me with thy plagues, thy "arrows" (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>), thy" wounds" (<a href="../../par/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>), thy poisoned shafts (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). Thou givest me no rest, therefore I am ever conscious of my afflictions. As a fierce lion. Schultens regards Job as the lion, and so Jarchi and others. But most commentators take the view that the lion is God (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-10.htm">Lamentations 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7, 8</a>).

Each fresh calamity that Job suffers is a new witness that God is displeased with him, both in his own eyes, and in those of his "comforters."

Must not my disease make an end of me in a very brief space? If so, then may I not make a request? My petition is that God will 'cease' from me, grant me a respite, 'let me alone' for a short time, remove his heavy hand, and allow me to 'take comfort a little,' recover my strength, and obtain a breathing-space, before my actual end, before the time comes for my descent to Sheol," which is then (vers. 21, 22) described.

The Babylonians spoke of it as "the abode of darkness and famine, where earth was men's food, and their  nourishment clay; where light was not seen, but in darkness they dwelt; where ghosts, like birds, fluttered their wings; and where, on the doors and on the door-posts, the dust lay undisturbed" (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. 1. p. 118).

He begins by accusing Job of having spoken at undue length, and at the same time, boastfully and mockingly (vers. 2-4). He then expresses a wish that God would take Job at his word, and really answer him, since he is sure that the result would be to show that Job had been punished much less than he. deserved to be (vers. 5, 6). Job's complaints against the justice of God's dealings he meets by an assertion of God's unsearchableness and perfect wisdom, which he contrasts with the folly of man (ver. 7-12). Finally, he suggests that a stricken man, being guilty, should humble himself, put away his iniquity, and turn to God, in which ease he may expect a restoration to favour. Otherwise, he has only to look for wretchedness, failure, and despair (vers. 18-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 2:11).

Job had certainly been somewhat unduly verbose, and laid himself open to the taunt here launched against him; but neither had brevity been studied by his other friends in their previous answers (ch. 4, 5, and 8.), nor is it greatly studied by Zophar here. <span class="cmt_word">And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> literally, <span class="accented">a man of lips</span> which may mean either "a great talker" or "a man who makes many professions."

And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed I It is not quite easy to see what in Job's speeches up to this point could be regarded as "mocking." But perhaps Zophar would have thus characterized the following passages: <a href="../../par/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13, 14, 25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>.

Job had certainly not said this in so many words. In fact, he had not spoken of his "doctrine" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d7;</span>), nor had he called either his doctrine or his conduct absolutely pure (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span>). But, no doubt, he had maintained, in a certain sense, his innocency; not, indeed, his entire freedom from sin or guilt, but his honest endeavour to serve God and lead a good life. This was the real point disputed between him and his "comforters;" they argued, from his sufferings, that he must be a "chief sinner;" he maintained, from the testimony of his conscience, that he was free from all heinous sins<span class="cmt_word">.

Zophar wishes that he would reveal to Job this wisdom, or a portion of it, as, in that case, all his pride and self-confidence would be confounded and fall away. That they are double to that which is! This phrase is very obscure. Some translate, "For he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) is twice as wise as thou;" others, "That it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom) is manifold in effectual working;" others, again, "That they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the treasures of wisdom) are double (or manifold) in substance." Perhaps this last rendering is to be preferred. The treasures of wisdom that are hid away in God have many depths, secret and unexplored; they "lie, as it were, fold over fold, in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinizing gaze" (Professor Stanley Leathes). If they were revealed to Job, they would astonish, confound, silence, him. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. "Be sure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "that God, so far from inflicting on thee a more severe punishment than thou deservest, in reality excuses much of thy guilt, and punishes thee less than is thy due." This is Zophar's conclusion from his general knowledge of God's dealings with man (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>).

No. In one sense, all men do well to profess them. selves "Agnostics" - not that they can know nothing of God, but that they can never know him fully, never exhaust the knowledge of him.

If God, that is, advance against a man in hostile fashion, seize and imprison him, and then call him to judgment, what is to be said or done? who can interfere with him?

God is justified in these his judgments, even though he does not implead the man or bring him to account, or hear what he has got to say (Job 9:39), since he intuitively and at once "knoweth vain men;" sooth, that is, into the ground of the heart, and recognizes vanity, pretence, false seeming, so that he can judge infallibly without the forensic apparatus wherewith human tribunals are rightly surrounded, on account of the weakness and fallibility of human judges. He sooth wickedness also. If God can detect in a moment vanity,  pretence, false seeming, much more can he detect actual wickedness; which Zophar assumes to have been detected in Job's case<span class="cmt_word">. Will he not then consider it?</span> rather, <span class="accented">even though he consider it not</span> (see the Revised Version). God does not need to pause and ponder and "consider" each case.

Zophar seems to mean that, through Divine discipline, such as that described in ver. 10, a vain, foolish, puffed-up man may be reclaimed and become a man of understanding - a stubborn and untamed one, wild as the colt of a wild ass, grow into a real man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> acquire sense and discretion.

Having indicated God's righteousness by these general remarks (vers. 7-12), and implied that Job's complaints are vain and futile, Zophar, in conclusion, addresses Job once more directly: "If thou (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) prepare thine heart," cleanse it, that is, of all defilement, direct it, and set it straight (see <a href="../../par/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>) before God, then such and such results (set forth in vers. 15-19) will follow. And stretch out thine hands toward him. The outward act of worship must follow the inward movement of the heart, for the turning to God to be complete. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">If iniquity <i>be</i> in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If iniquity be in thine hand</span>. Zophar assumes this to be probable, nay, almost certain. He has already told Job that God has exacted from him less than his iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the same word) deserves (ver. 6). Conformably with this view, he now suggests that it would not do for Job to stretch out to God in prayer a hand full of iniquity, and that therefore, previously to making his supplication, he would do well to lay his iniquity aside. In a general way, the advice is excellent; but it was insulting to Job, who denied that he had any definite act of sin on his conscience. <span class="cmt_word">Put it far away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repent of it, confess it to God; if the case admits of it, make reparation or restitution. <span class="cmt_word">And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles</span>; or, in thy tents.

The Hebrew cannot possibly bear this meaning. The uncommon word used is allied with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "obscurity," and, if a verb, should mean "thou shalt be obscure," rather than "thou shalt shine forth." But it is perhaps a substantive, meaning "darkness;" and the translation of the Revised Version is perhaps correct: "Though there be darkness." Thou shalt be as the morning. "Thy light," as Professor Lee explains, "shall gradually rise and expand itself far and wide." It shall dispel the darkness, and take its place," shining more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>).

Job, entering on this second period of prosperity, would be and feel secure; safe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from any return of calamity, because hope would once more animate him and be his predominant feeling. No doubt "hope springs eternal in the human breast;" and when Job's prosperity was actually restored (<a href="../../par/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12-16</a>), these anticipations had their fulfilment; but, as uttered by Zophar, there is a ring of insincerity about them, and we cannot but feel that his object in expatiating at length on the details of Job's coming happiness is not to console and encourage his friend, but rather to annoy and exasperate him, since the entire basis on which he builds is the assumption of Job's heinous guilt (vers. 3, 6, 11, 14), and the prosperity which he promises is to follow upon an acknowledgment of guilt and a putting sway of iniquity (vers. 13, 14), which he  knew that Job wholly repudiated<span class="cmt_word">. Yea, thou shalt dig about thee</span>. So Schultens, who understands it to mean that Job shall dig a moat around his habitation, to make himself perfectly secure. The verb has, however, two other meanings - "to investigate" or "search out," and "to blush;" and it is taken here in each of these meanings by some critics. Our Revisers translate, "Yea, thou shalt search about thee;" and so Canon Cook and Professor Stanley Loathes. Rosenmuller, on the other hand, and Professor Lee render the words by "Though thou shouldst blush," or "be ashamed." It is difficult to decide between such high authorities; but the fast that Job uses the verb in the sense of "search," "look after," in <a href="../../par/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, and does not elsewhere use it in either of the other senses, should incline us to accept the rendering of the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt take thy rest in safety</span>; or, <span class="accented">securely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a sense of being in perfect security.

Having set at rest the personal question between himself and his friends, Job reverts to his main argument, and maintains that, the whole course of mundane events being under God's governance, all the results are to be attributed to him, and among them both the prosperity of the wicked, and, by parity of reasoning, the sufferings of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">And they that provoke God are secure</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly</span>.

The instincts of birds, their periodical migrations, their inherited habits, are as wonderful as anything in the Divine economy of the universe, and as much imply God's continually directing hand.

If the material earth be intended, the appeal must be to its orderly course, its summers and winters, its seedtime and harvest, its former and latter rains, its constant productivity, which, no less than animal instincts, speak of a single ruling power directing and ordering all things. If the creeping things of the earth, the reptile creation, be meant, then the argument is merely an expansion of that in the preceding verse. The instincts of reptiles are to be ascribed, no less than those of beasts and birds, to the constant superintending action and providence of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee</span>. The testimony will be unanimous - beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes will unite in it.

The writer probably regards the name as unfamiliar, if not unknown, to Job's neighbours, and therefore as avoided by him in his discussions with them. But here, for once, he forgets to be consistent with himself. Outside Scripture, the name is first found on the Moabite Stone (about  <span class="date">B.C. 890</span>), where it designates the God worshipped by the Israelites (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 166, 1. 18).

Professor Lee thinks that the allusion is to the cities of the plain (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-29</a>).

He shutteth up a man (comp. <a href="../../par/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>).

But, beside this great occasion, he also in ten thousand other cases, causes, by means of floods, tremendous ruin and devastation, sweeping away crops and cattle, and even villages and cities, sometimes even "overturning the earth," causing lakes to burst, rivers to change their course, vast tracts of land to be permanently submerged, and the contour of coasts to be altered.

Moral evil is thus under his control, and, <span class="accented">in a certain</span> sense, may be celled his doing.

This may either mean that God at his pleasure both looses kings from captivity, and also binds them with a cord and causes them to be carried away captive; or that he looses the authority which kings have over their subjects, and then lets them be carried away captive by their enemies. The latter is perhaps the more probable sense.

This is the only mention of "priests" in the Book of Job, and a priest-caste, such as that of Egypt or of Israel, can scarcely be meant. The priests are placed among the mighty, on a par with kings (ver. 18), princes (ver. 21), and "the strong" (ver. 21). This context makes us naturally think of those priest-kings whom we hear of in the olden times, such as were Melchizedek (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18-20</a>) and Jethro (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1-27</a>), and the Egyptian kings of the twenty-first dynasty ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 408-415), and Ethbaal of Tyro ('History of Phoenicia,' p. 435), and Sethos (Herod., 2, 141), and others. Job's allusion is probably to persons of this exalted class, who no doubt were sometimes defeated and dragged into captivity, like other rulers and governors. And overthroweth the mighty. Schultens understands by <span class="accented">ethanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "great teachers;" but the ordinary meaning of the word is "strong" or "mighty" (see <a href="../../par/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).

By "deep things" are probably meant the "deeply laid schemes" which wicked men concoct in darkness (or secrecy). These God often "discovers," or causes to be laid bare. English history can point to such a case in the discovery of the famous "Gunpowder Plot" in the second year of King James I. <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth out to light the shadow of death</span>. There is nothing secret which God cannot, if he choose, reveal; nor is there anything hid which he cannot make known.

God's providence concerns itself, not only with the fate of individual men, bet also with that of nations. With Israel, his "peculiar people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), he especially concerned himself, but not with Israel only. Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Elam, Edom, Ammon, Moab, were likewise objects of his attention, of his guidance, of his chastening hand, of his avenging rod. Particular nations were consigned by God to the charge of particular angels (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20</a>). At his pleasure he can "increase" nations by blessing them with extraordinary fecundity (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7-12</a>), or "destroy" them by internal decay, by civil wars, or by the swords of their neighbours. <span class="cmt_word">He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "enlarges their bounds, or diminishes them." In Western Asia, where Job lived, empires were continually starting up, growing and expanding, increasing to vast dimensions, and then after a while shrinking back again to their original narrow limits Egypt, Elam, Babylon, and the Hittite nation were <span class="accented">eases</span> in point.

Ver. 1 is little more than a repetition of <a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a> and ver. 2 of <a href="../../par/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it</span>. All the particulars mentioned concerning God's government of the world in <a href="../../par/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6-25</a> are derived by Job from his own experience. His eye has seen them or his ear has heard them. He is not indebted to others for information on these simple points, which he regards as necessarily impressed by their experience on all grown men (see <a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>).

Job's friends have claimed to instruct him and set him right, on the ground of their age and experience (<a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-27.htm">Job 5:27</a>; <a href="../../par/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-10</a>), He protests that, in the matters on which they have lectured him, they have no advantage over himself - he knows all that they know - in truth, the knowledge is open to all (see <a href="../../par/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>). I am not inferior unto you. An exact repetition of the second clause of <a href="../../par/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-13.</span> - The second section of Job's argument is prefaced, like the first (<a href="../../par/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2-5</a>), with a complaint with respect to the conduct of his opponents. He taxes them with the fabrication of lies (ver 4), with want of skill as physicians of souls (ver. 4), with vindicating God by reasonings in which they do not themselves believe (vers. 7, 8), and consequently with really mocking him (ver. 9). Having warned them that they are more likely to offend God than to please him by such arguments as those that they have urged (vers. 10-12), he calls on them to hold their peace, and allow him to plead his cause with God (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I would speak to the Almighty</span>. It is not Job's wish to argue his ease with his three friends, but to reason it out with God. His friends, however, interfere with this design, check it, thwart it, prevent him from carrying it out. He must therefore first speak a few words to them. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">I desire to reason with God</span>. Compare God's own invitation to his people, "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), and again, "Put me in remembrance, let us plead together; declare thou, that thou mayest be justified" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>); which indicate God's gracious willingness to allow men to plead on their own behalf before him, and do their best to justify themselves.

A harsh expression, indicating that Job was thoroughly exasperated. The lies which his friends had forged were, partly, misrepresentations of what he had said, as for example <a href="../../par/job/11-4.htm">Job 11:4</a>, but mainly statements, more or less covert, which implied that he had brought all his calamities on himself by a course of evil-doing (see <a href="../../par/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/8-13.htm">Job 8:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11, 14, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye are all physicians of no value</span>. Job's friends had come to him to "comfort" him (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>), and act as physicians of his soul. But they had entirely failed to be of the least service. They had not even understood his case. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!</span> The friends had "held their peace" for seven days after their arrival (<a href="../../par/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>). Oh that they would have held it <span class="accented">altogether</span>! Their words had done nothing but exasperate and goad almost to madness. There is a mournful pathos in Job's entreates to them to be silent (comp ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">And it should be your wisdom</span>. "Speech," it has been said, "is silvern, silence is golden." No doubt" there is a time for everything<span class="cmt_word">...</span>  a time to keep silence, and a time to speak" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7</a>); nor is the rule of La Trappe altogether a wise one. But probably ten times as much harm is done in the world by speaking as by keeping silence. "Words for God" need especial care and caution.  If they do not do good, the harm that they may do is incalculable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-6.htm">Job 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear now my reasoning</span>. As his friends have not kept silence, but have spoken, Job claims a right to be heard in his turn. If it be thought that he is somewhat impatient, it must be remembered that his opponents are three to one, all eager to catch him in a fault, and not very mild in their reprimands. <span class="cmt_word">And hearken to the pleadings of my lips</span>. Job's "pleadings" are addressed, not to his friends, but to God, and are contained in vers. 14-28 of the present, and the whole of the succeeding chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will ye speak wickedly for God?</span> We are not to suppose that Job's friends consciously used unsound and untrue arguments in their disputations with him on God's behalf. On the contrary, they are to be regarded as convinced of the truth of their own reasonings - as brought up in the firm belief, that temporal prosperity or wretchedness was dealt out by God, immediately, by his own will, to his subjects according to their behaviour. Holding this, they naturally thought that Job, being so greatly afflicted, must be a great sinner, and, as they could not very plausibly allege any open sins against him, they saw in his sufferings a judgment on him for secret sins. "His chosen friends, as Mr. Froude says, "wise, good, pious men, as wisdom and piety were then, without one glimpse of the true cause of his sufferings, saw in them a judgment of this character. He became to them an illustration, and even (such are the para-logisms of men of this description) a proof of their theory that 'the prosperity of the wicked is but for a while;' and instead of the comfort and help that they might have brought him, and which in the end they were made to bring him, he is to them no more than a text for the enunciation of solemn falsehood" ('Short Studies,' vol. 1. p. 300), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of statements which were false, though solemnly believed by them to be true. <span class="cmt_word">And talk deceitfully for him</span>. "Deceitfully," because untruly, yet so plausibly as to be likely to deceive others.

This is like the conduct of a judge who should allow his decision to be biassed by favour towards one or the other party in a suit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a></div><div class="verse">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye <i>so</i> mock him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it good that he should search you out?</span> "Are your motives in thus acting," Job asks his opponents, "so pure that they will stand the severity of God's judgment when he turns his scrutiny upon <span class="accented">you</span> and searches out the grounds of your proceedings?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-12.htm">Job 13:12</a></div><div class="verse">Your remembrances <i>are</i> like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your remembrances are like unto ashes</span>. The "remembrances" intended are probably the wise saws, embodiments of the ancient wisdom, on which Job's adversaries have relied in their disputations with him (<a href="../../par/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-11</a>, etc.). These Job declares to be mere dust and ashes - useless, worthless, such as the first breath of air wilt blow away. <span class="cmt_word">Your bodies to bodies of clay</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your mounds</span> or <span class="accented">your defences</span> (see the Revised Version). These defences, Job <span class="accented">says - i.e</span>, the arguments by which his opponents support their views - are no better than "defences of clay " - easy to batter down and destroy. The ancient defences of a town were usually either of stone, as at Khorsabad ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 278, 279), or of crude brick faced with burnt brick, as at Babylon and elsewhere. But Job seems to be speaking of something more primitive than either of these - mere earthworks, like the Roman <span class="accented">aggera</span> hastily thrown up and easy to level with the ground. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-13.htm">Job 13:13</a></div><div class="verse">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what <i>will</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak</span>; literally, <span class="accented">be silent from me that</span> I <span class="accented">may speak</span>; but our version gives the true meaning. Job repeats the entreaty with which he had bemoan (vers. 5, 6<span class="cmt_word">). And let some on me what will</span>. Job is prepared to face the worst. He feels, as he expresses it below (ver. 19), that, if he holds his tongue, he must die. He <span class="accented">must</span> speak, and speak he will. After that, let God do as he may please - he will accept his punishment, if God thinks fit to punish him.

The general meaning is, "Why do I jeopardize everything - my body, taking it as it were between my teeth; and my soul, taking it as it were in my hand?" Neither idea will bear minute analysis; but the latter, at any rate, was known to the Greeks (Athen., 'Deipnosoph.,' p. 569), and is common in English. <span class="cmt_word">And put my life in my hand</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-109.htm">Psalm 119:109</a>).

Those who prefer the latter commonly render it, "I have no hope;" but it is pointed out by Canon Cook that there are reasons for regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> as an archaic form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which sometimes takes its place. If this be not allowed the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> will have to be preferred, on the double authority of the versions and of the context.

Whatever God does to him (ver. 13), whatever burden he lays upon him, though he even "slay" him (ver. 15), yet Job is sure that ultimately, in one way or another, God will be his Salvation. It is this determined trustfulness which at once gives Job's character its strength, and atones in a certain sense for his over-boldness in challenging God to a controversy. His heart is right with God. Though the secrets of the unseen world have been hidden from him, and the condition of man after death is a mystery on which he can only form vague conjectures, yet he is sure that in the end God will not fail him. <span class="cmt_word">For an hypocrite shall not come before him</span>. If he were a hypocrite the case would be different; he would tremble before God, instead of feeling confident. But, knowing that he is honest and true, he is not afraid; he is bold to "come before him," and plead his cause before him.

Some translate, "For now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost," which they explain to mean, "If God does implead me, I shall take refuge in silence, and straightway expire." But this seems an impossible conclusion, when all that Job has been aiming at and striving for since his opponents taxed him with wickedness has been that he might "speak to the Almighty, and reason with God" (ver. 3). It is far simpler to keep to the translation of the Authorized Version, and understand Job to mean that things have now reached a point at which he must either speak or expire.

Before beginning his plea, Job has two requests to make of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That he will put an end for a time to his bodily sufferings - suspend them, at any rate, while the pleading continues; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he will during the same space abstain from terrifying him mentally, as he had done on previous occasions (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>; see below, ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Then will I not hide myself from thee</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from thy face</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34, 35</a>, "Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: then would I speak, and not fear him ").

Job views all his physical suffering as coming directly from the hand of God - momentarily caused by him, and therefore removable by him at any moment. He has no thought for secondary causes. <span class="cmt_word">And let not thy dread make me afraid</span>. Job speaks here and elsewhere of spiritual terrors - those vague and impalpable fears which suggest themselves inwardly to the soul, and are tar more painful, far more dreadful, than any amount of bodily anguish. Unless he is free from these, as well as from physical pains, he cannot plead his cause freely and fully.

"Then" - when I am free from suffering, both mental and bodily - implead me, bring thy charges against me, and I will answer them. As Mr. Fronds observes, "Job himself had been educated in the same creed" as his comforters; "he, too,  had been taught to see the hand of God in the outward dispensation" ('Short Studies,' vol. 1. p. 300). He therefore assumes that God will have a particular charge to make against him, in connection with each of the calamities that have come on him, and he is prepared to face these changes and confute them. At the same time, he is undoubtedly much confused and perplexed, not knowing how to reconcile his traditional belief with his internal consciousness of innocence. <span class="cmt_word">Or let me speak, and answer thou me</span>. "Let me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "take the initiative, if thou preferrest it so - let me ask the questions, and do thou answer."

It is more in the nature of a remonstrance. "These sins of mine, for which I. am so grievously punished, what are they? Name them. How many are there of them? Let me know exactly what they are; and then I can question my conscience concerning them." <span class="cmt_word">Make me to know my transgression and my sin</span>. These words imply that lie does not know them at present. He knows of some infirmities and lighter misdoings of his youth (ver. 26); but he knows of no such sins as are commensurate with his sufferings.

Job does not believe God to be his enemy. He knows that God will one day be his Salvation (ver. 16); but he recognizes a present alienation, and desires to be made acquainted with the cause of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a></div><div class="verse">Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</span> Job compares himself to two of the weakest things in nature - a withered leaf, and a morsel of dry stubble. He cannot believe that God will employ his almighty strength in crushing and destroying what is so slight and feeble. A deep sense of God's goodness and compassion underlies the thought.

The allusion seems to be to the ordinary practice in ancient law-courts of formulating a written <span class="accented">acte d'accusation</span> against supposed criminals. Keeping up the imagery of a court and pleadings, Job represents God as engaged in drawing up such a document against him. The "bitter things" are the charges which the acts contains. <span class="cmt_word">And makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth</span>. Job, like David, has to acknowledge "sins and offences" committed in his youth (<a href="../../par/psalms/25-6.htm">Psalm 25:6</a>). In considering what the indictment against him can be, he can only suppose that these old and long-forsaken sins are being remembered and brought up against him, and that he is being punished for them. He does not exclaim against this as injustice; he feels probably that there is no statute of limitations respecting sins and their punishment; but it can scarcely have seemed to him consistent with God's goodness and mercifulness that the offences of his immature age should be visited upon him so bitterly.

It would seem that the patriarch, having vented his feelings, experiences a certain relief, an interval of calm, in which, his own woes pressing less heavily upon him, he is content to moralize on the general condition of humanity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man that is born of a woman</span>. In this fact Job sees the origin of man's inherent  weakness. He is "born of a woman," who is "the weaker vessel" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). He is conceived by her in uncleanness (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; comp. below, ver. 4), brought forth in sorrow and pain (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) suckled at her breasts, placed for years under her guidance.

Methuselah, perhaps, thought the same. We all, as we come towards old age, and death draws manifestly near, feel as if we had only just begun to live, as if, at any rate, we had not done half our work, and were about to be cut off before our time. But would the case be seriously different if our tale of years were doubled? And fall of trouble (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>).

Shadows are always changing; but the shadows which flee away the fastest, and which Job has probably in his mind, are those of clouds, or other moving objects, which seem to chase each other over the earth, and never to continue for a single minute in one stay.

The question has been often asked, and answered by many in the negative, as by the Epicureans of old. Job does not really entertain any doubt upon the point; but only intends to express his wonder that it should be so (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, and above, <a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bringest me into judgment with thee?</span> Especially astonishing is it, Job says, that God should condescend to try, pass judgment on, and punish so weak, worthless, and transitory a creature as himself.

It is scarcely true to say that "the fact of original sin is thus distinctly recognized" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 61). Original uncleanness and infirmity are recognized; but the uncleanness is material, and removable by material expiation (<a href="../../par/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2-8</a>).

God's vegetable creation is better off, in respect of length of days, than man. Let a tree be cut down, it is not therefore of necessity destroyed. There is yet hope for it. The bare dry stump will sometimes put forth tender branches, which will grow and flourish, and renew the old life. Or, if the stump be quite dead, suckers may spring up from the root and grow into new trees as vigorous as the one that they replace (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). Herodotus considered that all trees had this recuperative power, except the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, a species of fir (Herod., 6:37), and the traveller Shaw says that when a palm tree dies there is always a sucker ready to take its place. Pliny also observes of the laurel, "Viva-cissima est radix, ita ut, si truncus ina-ruerit, recisa arbor mox laetius frutificet" ('Hist.

Job could not answer this question. He might say, "In Sheol." But where was Sheol, and what was Sheol? There was no written revelation on this subject, and no traditional knowledge on which dependence could be placed. The Hebrew notions on the subject were very vague and indeterminate; Job's notions are likely to have been still vaguer. There is no reason to believe that he had any exact acquaintance with the tenets of the Egyptians. He may have known the Chaldean teaching, but it would not have carried him very far(see above, pp. 178, 179). Doubt and perplexity beset him whenever he turned his attention to the problem of man's condition after death, and, excepting when carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, he seems to have regarded it as the highest wisdom, in matters of this kind, "to knew that he knew nothing." The question, "Where is he?" is an acknowledgment of this profound ignorance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the waters fail from the sea</span>. The allusion seems to be to the actual desiccation of seas and rivers. Job, apparently, had known instances of both. A formation of new land in the place, of sea is always going on at the head of the Persian Gulf, through the deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates; and this formation was very rapid in ancient times, when the head of the gulf was narrower. The desiccation of river-courses is common in Mesopotamia, where arms thrown out by the Tigris and Euphrates get blocked, and then silted up. <span class="cmt_word">And the flood decayeth and drieth up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> <span class="accented">river decayeth</span> etc. (see the comment on the preceding clause).

This is not an absolute denial of a <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, since Job is speaking of the world as it lies before him, not of eventualities. Just as he sees the land encroach upon the sea, and remain land, and the river-courses, once dried up, remain dry, so he sees men descend into the grave and remain there, without rising up again. This is the established order of nature as it exists before his eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake</span>. This order of things, Job believes, rightly enough, will continue as long as the heavens and the earth endure. What will happen afterwards he does not so much as inquire. It is remarked, ingeniously, that Job's words, though not intended in this sense, exactly "coincide with the declarations of the New Testament, which make the resurrection simultaneous with the breaking up of the visible universe" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Nor be raised out of their sleep</span>. If "the glimmer of a hope" of the resurrection appears anywhere in vers. 10-12, it is in the comparison of death to a sleep, which is inseparably connected in our minds with an awakening.

Job desires to have God's protection in that" land of darkness," and to be "hidden" there by him until his wrath be past. It has been generally supposed that he means after his death; but Schultens thinks his desire was to descend to Sheol <span class="accented">alive</span> and there remain, while his punishment continued, hidden from the eyes of men. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past.</span> Job assumes that, if he is being punished for his youthful sins (<a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>), his punishment will not be for long - at any rate, not for ever; God's anger will at last be satisfied and cease. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> How long he may have to suffer be does not greatly care. Only let it be "a set time" - a fixed, definite period  - and at the end of it, let God" remember" him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">If a man die, shall he live <i>again</i>? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man die, shall he live again?</span> The question is clearly intended to be answered in the negative. It is not a dispassionate inquiry, but an expression of hopelessness. Let a man once die, and of course he cannot live again. Were it otherwise, then, Job says, <span class="cmt_word">all the days of my appointed time will I wait;</span> or, rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">all the days of my warfare would</span> I <span class="accented">wait</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I would patiently endure any sufferings in the larger hope that would then be open to me. <span class="cmt_word">I would wait till my change</span> (rather, <span class="accented">my renewal</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>come</span>. The exact nature of the 'renewal" which Job seems here to expect is obscure. Perhaps he is pursuing the idea, broached in ver. 13, of his being conveyed <span class="accented">alive</span> to Hades, and looks forward to a furthur renewed life after he is released from that "land of darkness."

In that case, when I quitted Hades, and renewed my life, thou wouldst assuredly summon me to thee, and I would respond to the summons. There would be sweet colloquy between us; for thou wilt (or, rather, <span class="accented">wouldest</span>) have a desire to the work of thine hands (comp. ch. 10:8-11). Job assumes that God must love whatever he has created, and be drawn towards it by a secret, strong desire.

Job, at this point, proceeds to contrast his actual condition with the ideal one which (in vers. 13-15) his imagination has conjured up. God's actual attitude towards him he regards as one, not of protecting love, but of jealous hostility. His "steps" are observed, counted - every divergence from the right path is noted - a false step, if he makes one, is at once punished. <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou not watch over my sin?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a>). Job's sins, he thinks, are watched for, spied out, taken note of, and remembered against him.

They are "sealed up" in the bag for greater security. <span class="cmt_word">And thou sewest up mine iniquity.</span> (So Ewald, Dillmaun, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version.)

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-18.htm">Job 14:18</a></div><div class="verse">And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought</span>. Job here resumes the lament 'over human infirmity, with which the chapter opens (vers. 1-12); but he has, perhaps, in this passage, his own case mote distinctly presented to his consciousness. With the wealth of metaphor which characterizes his utterances, he compares the ruin of a prosperous man <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the sudden collapse of a mountain; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the removal of a rock out of its place; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the wearing away of stones by the constant flow of streams; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to the destruction of alluvial tracts by floods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mountains collapse, either by volcanic agency, which is quite as much shown in the subsidence as in the elevation of the soil, or by landslips, which are most usually the results of heavy rains. <span class="cmt_word">And the rock is removed out of his place</span>. Rocks are sometimes split by frost, and topple over when a thaw comes; at other times, heavy floods remove them from their accustomed place; occasionally earthquakes overturn them, and cause them to fall with a crash. There is also a removal of rocks to much greeter distances, by means of glaciers and icebergs; but of these Job is not likely to have known. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a></div><div class="verse">The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow <i>out</i> of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters wear the stones</span>. The power of the soft element of water, by continual washing or dripping, to wear away the hardest stone, has often been noticed, and is a frequent topic in poetry. Deep ravines have been worn in course of time, through broad and lofty mountain ranges by rivers, the stone yielding little by little to the action of the water, until at last a broad chasm is made. So the continual wearing action of calamity often lays low the prosperous. <span class="cmt_word">Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "overflows of water, inundations, floods, not only make a way through rocks, but often carry off great tracts of rich soil, hurrying the alluvium down to the sea, and leaving in its place a marsh or a waste." <span class="cmt_word">And thou destroyest the hope of man</span>.

The meaning seems to be, "If his sons come to honour, it is of no advantage to him; in the remote and wholly separate region of Sheol he will not be aware of it." The view is more dismal than that of Aristotle, who argues that the fate of those whom they have loved and left on earth will be sure to penetrate, in course of time (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)' to the departed, and cause them a certain amount of joy or sorrow ('Eth.

Job, as setting up to be "a wise man," should not have indulged in such empty and foolish speaking. It is observable that  Eliphaz does not point out what part of Job's discourses he considers objectionable, but condemns the whole of them under this broad and general description, which even he could not have regarded as applicable to more than a portion of what Job had said. <span class="cmt_word">And fill his belly with the east wind?</span> The east wind was regarded as the worst of winds.

To Eliphaz, Job's words - his bold expostulations (<a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3, 15, 22</a>, etc.), his declarations that he <span class="accented">knows</span> he will be justified (<a href="../../par/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>), and that God will be his Salvation (<a href="../../par/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) - seem to imply that he has cast off altogether the fear of God, and is entirely devoid of reverence. Some of his expressions certainly seem over-bold; but, on the other hand, his sense of God's purity, perfectness, and transcendent power is continually manifest, and should have saved him from the rude reproach here launched against him (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-1.htm">Job 9:1-13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a> 25; 13:11, 21, etc.). And restrainest prayer before God; rather, <span class="accented">and hinderest devout meditation</span> before God. Eliphaz means that Job expresses himself in a way so cf. fensive to devout souls, that he disturbs their minds and prevents them from indulging in those pious meditations on the Divine goodness which would otherwise occupy them (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>). Thus, according to Eliphaz, Job is not only irreligious himself, but the cause of irreligion in others.

It is not clear that Eliphaz had ever heard of Adam; but he evidently believed in a "first man," from whom all others were descended, and he attributed to this first man a mind and intellect surpassing those of all other men. His question is, of course, rather a scoff than an inquiry. He knows that Job makes no such foolish pretence; but he throws it in his teeth that, from what he has said, men might suppose he took some such view of himself. <span class="cmt_word">Or wast thou made before the hills?</span> This is a taunt of the same kind as the previous one, but intensified.

Job was not more advanced in knowledge than Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. But he had a keener spiritual insight. He was wiser in the "wisdom which is from above."

This is all reasonable enough from his standpoint, that Job is conscious of secret heinous guilt; but it can make no impression on Job, who is conscious of the reverse. <span class="cmt_word">Is there any secret thing with thee?</span> rather, <span class="accented">And is the word</span> [<span class="accented">of small account that dealeth</span>] <span class="accented">gently with thee?</span> Eliphaz considers that his own words and those of his two companions have been soft words, dealing "gently" with Job's refractoriness, and that Job ought to have been impressed by them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-12.htm">Job 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why doth thine heart carry thee away?</span> or, <span class="accented">Whither doth thine heart carry thee away?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to what a pitch of presumption and audacity do thy proud thoughts carry thee? And what do thy eyes wink at? or, <span class="accented">Wherefore do thy eyes roll?</span> The verb used occurs only in this place. Its meaning is very doubtful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-13.htm">Job 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest <i>such</i> words go out of thy mouth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou turnest thy spirit against God</span>. To Eliphaz and his companions, the wild remonstrances of Job, his vehement expostulations and despairing outcries, are, one and all, nothing better than indications of a proud and rebellious spirit, that sets itself up against the Almighty, and openly contends with him. They view Job, after the speeches that he has made, as a declared rebel, and no longer regard it as incumbent upon them to use any "gentleness" in their reprimands. <span class="cmt_word">And lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</span> It is remarkable that neither Eliphaz nor either of his friends ever points out what <span class="accented">particular</span> words of Job they object to and regard as impious, so as to give him the opportunity of defending, explaining, or retracting them. They take refuge in vague generalities, with which it is impossible to grapple. But this vagueness and want of logical accuracy is characteristic of the Oriental nations, who scarcely ever reason cogently or bring matters to a point. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a></div><div class="verse">What <i>is</i> man, that he should be clean? and <i>he which is</i> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is man, that he should be clean?</span> A vain "beating of the air." Eliphaz had asserted the same truth in his first speech, when he said, "Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he taxeth with folly: <span class="accented">how m</span>u<span class="accented">ch less in them that dwell in houses of clay</span> whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?" (<a href="../../par/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-19</a>); and Job had given his full assent to it, when he exclaimed, "I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>). The true question was not whether Job or any other man was" clean," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wholly <span class="accented">sinless</span> but whether Job had sinned so deeply and grievously that his sufferings were the natural and just punishment for his sins. And a mere repetition of the statement that all men were sinful and unclean was off the <span class="accented">point - nihil ad rem-</span>altogether futile and superfluous. <span class="cmt_word">And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> (setup. <a href="../../par/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>). The clause is a mere variant of the preceding one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his holy ones</span> (see the Revised Version). The word "saint" has in course of time come to be so exclusively attached to holy <span class="accented">men</span>' that it can no longer be applied, without danger of being misunderstood, to angels. Eliphaz here, as in <a href="../../par/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>, speaks not of holy men, but of the holy angels. Without taxing them with sin, he is strongly convinced of their imperfection - their defective wisdom (<a href="../../par/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>), weakness, and untrustworthiness. His views are decidedly peculiar, and not borne out by the rest of Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span> The material heavens are probably intended. That limpid liquid blue in which the human eye sees no stain or speck, to the Divine eye is tinged with uncleanness The idea is that neither animate nor inanimate nature contains any form of being that is absolutely without spot or blemish. In God alone is there perfect purity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">How much more abominable and filthy <i>is</i> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like</span>  <span class="cmt_word">water?</span> rather, <span class="accented">How much less one that is abominable and impure</span> <span class="accented">a man that drinketh in iniquity</span> <span class="accented">etc.?</span> It cannot be doubted that Job is individually pointed at. Not mankind generally, but a particular man, is intended; and the particular man can be none other than Job. Thus we see how the progress of the controversy has tended to exasperate the disputants, and change the "comforters" from smooth-tongued friends into open enemies and accusers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a></div><div class="verse">I will shew thee, hear me; and that <i>which</i> I have seen I will declare;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will show thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare</span>. Eliphaz here introduces, with an elaborate preface (vers. 17-19) what is either a citation from a book, as Professor Lee thinks, or a studied description by himself of the proceedings and consequent sufferings of the wicked. This description extends from ver. 20 to the end of the chapter, and is plainly levelled at Job, though it may originally have been intended to apply to some other person or persons. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid <i>it</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-10</a>). Whether the words are his own or not, the sentiments, at any rate, Eliphaz declares to have come down to him from remote times. The "wise men" to whom he refers may have been men of the Beni Kedem (<a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). who were noted for their wisdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), or possibly Egyptians or Babylonians. Books containing moral aphorisms and instructions were certainly composed both in Egypt and in Babyhmia at a very ancient date (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 3. p. 135; vol. 7. pp. 119-122). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-19.htm">Job 15:19</a></div><div class="verse">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom alone the earth was given</span>. The reference is clearly to a very remote time, when men were comparatively few, and lived in quiet possession of their own lands, undisturbed by invasions, wars, or struggles for territory. Professor Lee thinks that the times immediately after, and even those before, the Flood are glanced at; while Schultens regards Eliphaz as alluding to the first settlements of the Joktanidae in Arabia. In either case, the passage tells in favour or, and not against, the antiquity of the Book of Job, since it marks the composer as "living at a time when the memory of an age of patriarchal simplicity was yet fresh in men's minds" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">And no stranger passed among them</span>. Races were not mixed up one with another, and so the purity of primitive doctrine remained undisturbed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a></div><div class="verse">The wicked man travaileth with pain all <i>his</i> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-35.</span> - Schultens calls this "a magnificently elaborate oration, crowded with illustrations and metaphors, in which it is shown that the wicked cannot possibly escape being miserable, but that the punishment which they have so richly deserved assuredly awaits them, and is to be inflicted on them, as an example and terror to others, by a holy and just God, because, just as he loves virtue, so he pursues vice with a fierce and deadly hatred" ('Liber Jobi,' p. 104, edit. R. Grey). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days</span>. Certainly an over-statement of the truth. With a much nearer approach to the facts of the case, the Psalmist remarked, "I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity. For they are in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong. They come in no misfortune like other folk; neither are they plagued like other men" (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the number of years that is laid up for the oppressor.</span> So Merx and the Revised Version. Another possible meaning is, "And a [small] number of years is laid up," etc. If we take the former view, we must regard the clause as exegetical of "all his days." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21</a></div><div class="verse">A dreadful sound <i>is</i> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A dreadful sound is in his ears</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a sound of terrors.</span> Fears of all kinds beset him, lest he should lose his prosperity. Sometimes they seem actually to sound in his ears. Prosper as he may, he feels that in prosperity the destroyer shall one day come upon him. "The destroyer" may be either the destroying angel, or the avenger of blood, or a robber-chief at the head of a band of marauders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-22.htm">Job 15:22</a></div><div class="verse">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness</span>. He has no hope of recovering his prosperity, when calamity has once stricken him down, since he knows that his calamity is deserved, and feels that it is God's judgment upon him for his sins. <span class="cmt_word">And he is waited for of the sword</span>. He feels as if an enemy was lying in wait for him at every turn, with his sword drawn, ready to slay him. Professor Lee compares the words of Cain, "It shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a></div><div class="verse">He wandereth abroad for bread, <i>saying</i>, Where <i>is it</i>? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?</span> This, again, might appropriately have been said of Cain, who was "a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth" (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), and may at times have had difficulty in procuring his daily bread. At any rate, it is the frequent experience of the wicked who lose their ill-gotten gains, and are brought down to abject poverty, and actual want of the necessaries of life. "He wanders abroad <span class="accented">to be the food of vultures"</span> is a translation of the passage suggested by some moderns (as Merx), and has the  support of the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. But it requires a slight change in the pointing. <span class="cmt_word">He knoweth that the day of darkness is nigh at hand</span>. "The day of darkness" is probably the day of his decease: this he "knows," or at any rate, surmises, to be near.

Eliphaz seems covertly to allude to Job's misfortunes, which came against him with such force, and crushed him as a mighty king crushes his foes in battle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/15-25.htm">Job 15:25</a></div><div class="verse">For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he stretcheth out his hand against God</span>.

See</span> the Revised Version, and compare Schultens, who renders the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, by "ferocius et insolentius se gessit."

The ground and origin of the wicked man's audacity is his luxurious and intemperate living. In the days of his prosperity he pampered his body, freely indulged all his carnal appetites, and gave himself up to gluttony and gourmandism. This depraved his moral nature, separated between him and God, and finally produced in him the insolence and presumption described in vers. 25, 26 <span class="cmt_word">And maketh collops of fat on his flanks</span>. The same idea, only very slightly varied, as so often in the second member of a verse.

There was nothing new in the second speech of Eliphaz, if we except its increased bitterness. Job had heard all the commonplaces about the universal sinfulness of man, and the invariable connection between sin and suffering, a thousand times before. It was the traditional belief in which he and all those about him had been brought up. But it brought him no relief. The reiteration of it only made him feel that there was neither comfort nor instruction to be got from his so-called "comforters."

(Revised Version) Job had begged that his friends would be silent (<a href="../../par/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5, 13</a>). He supposes that they would have complied with his wish if he had not provoked them, but professes an inability to see what provocation he had given. His last speech, however, had certainly not been conciliatory (see <a href="../../par/job/12-1.htm">Job 12:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4, 7</a>, etc.).

The meaning is somewhat doubtful, and different renderings have been proposed. But the rendering of the Authorized Version is quite defensible, and is accepted by our Revisers. This gives the sense, "I, if I were in your place, would not act as you have acted, but, on the contrary, would do my best to strengthen you with words of comfort and encouragement." <span class="cmt_word">The moving of my lips should assuage your grief.</span> (So Rosenmuller and our Revisers.) The words are a covert reproach of the three "friends" for not acting as Job declares that he would have acted if the positions had been reversed.

These words mark a transition. Job turns from complaints against his "comforters" to an enumeration of his own sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">He hath made me weary</span>. God has afflicted him with an intolerable sense of weariness. He is tired of life; tired of disputing with his friends; tired even of pouring out his lamentations and complaints and expostulations to God. His one desire is rest. So I have seen in the <span class="accented">piombi</span> of Venice, where political prisoners were tortured by cold and heat, and hunger and thirst, for long weeks or months, and brought to despair, such scratchlags as the following: "Luigi A. implora pace, Giuseppe B. implore eterna quiete." Job has entreated for this boon of rest repeatedly (<a href="../../par/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made desolate all my company</span>.

So St. Jerome, Professor Lee, Dr. Stanley Leathes, and others; but the generality of modern commentators prefer the rendering, "Thou hast bound me fast," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> deprived me of all power of resisting or moving (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a>, "I am so fast in prison that I cannot get forth").

The "man of sorrows" of the Old Testament is, in many respects, a type of the "Man of sorrows" of the New; and, in the Messianic psalms, David constantly applies to Christ expressions which Job had used in reference to himself (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>). They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God hath delivered me to the ungodly</span>. All that Job had suffered at the hands of wicked men, the gibes of his "comforters," the insults and "derision ' of "base men" (<a href="../../par/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 8-10</a>), the desertion of many who might have been expected to have come to his aid, being by God's per-minion, is attributed by Job to God himself, who has "delivered" him up to these "ungodly" ones, and permits them to add to and intensify his sufferings. He was not so ruthlessly treated as his great Anti-type; he was not bound with thongs, or crowned with thorns, or smitten with a reed, or scourged, or crucified - even the smiting on the cheek, spoken of in ver. 10, was probably metaphorical; but he suffered, no doubt, grievously, through the scorn and contumely that assailed him, through his friends' unkindness, and his enimies'  insolent triumph, and the rude jeers of the "<span class="accented">abjeets</span>" who made him their "song" and their "byword" (<a href="../../par/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And turned me over into the hands of the wicked</span>. Job speaks as if God had wholly given him up, made him over to the wicked, to deal with him exactly as they chose. This, of course, was not so. If the malevolence of Satan was limited by the Divine will (<a href="../../par/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>); so, much more, would the malevolence of man be limited.

Job had been "at ease," tranquil, prosperous, happy. He had been almost without a care, when suddenly "trouble came." <span class="cmt_word">But he hath broken me asunder</span>; rather, he brake me <span class="accented">asunder</span> (see the Revised Version). In the midst of his ease and tranquillity, God suddenly poured out his chastisements, and "brake Job asunder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroyed his life, ruined it and broke it down. <span class="cmt_word">He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces</span>; or, <span class="accented">dashed me to pieces. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And set me up for his mark</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a target for his arrows (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His archers compass me round about</span>. God is represented, not as himself the shooter of the arrows, but as surrounding Job with a body of archers, who are under his command and carry out his will. So, generally, Scripture represents the judgments of God as carried out by interior agents (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare</span>. The allusion is probably to Job's physical sufferings, which included severe pains in the lumbar region. He poureth out my gall upon the ground. The rupture of the gallbladder causes the contents to be sprit upon the ground. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He breaketh me with breach upon breach</span>. As an enemy, when he besieges a town, crushes its resistance by means of "breach upon breach." so is Job crushed by one attack after another. He runneth upon me like a giant; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with overwhelming force - a force that is quite irresistible.

Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. <span class="cmt_word">And have defiled my horn in the dust</span>. "My horn" is equivalent to "my pride," "my dignity." Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and "sat down among the ashes" (<a href="../../par/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dust

Job repudiates the charge of rapine and robbery which Eliphaz has brought against him (<a href="../../par/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28, 34</a>). His hands have not done violence to any. <span class="cmt_word">Also my prayer is pure</span>.

Job apostrophizes the earth, and be-seethes it not to cover up his blood when he dies, as he expects to do, shortly. <span class="cmt_word">And let my cry have no place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it have no hiding-place, but fill earth and heaven.

Job claims God for his Witness, looks to him for an ultimate vindication of his character, is sure that in one way or another he will make his righteousness clear as the noonday in the sight of men and angels (see <a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>, of which this is in some sort an anticipation). <span class="cmt_word">My record</span> - or, he <span class="accented">that vouches for me</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">is on high</span> - one of the so frequent pleonastic repetitions of one and the same idea.

It is not to his "friends" or "companions," or "comforters," or any human aid, that Job turns in his distress. God alone is his Refuge. Forced by his woes to pass his time in weeping and mourning (see ver. 16), it is to God that his heart turns, to God that he "pours out his tears." Hardly as he thinks God to have used him, bitterly as he sometimes ventures to complain, yet the idea never crosses him of looking for help or sympathy to any other quarter, of having recourse to any other support or stay. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (<a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), expresses the deepest feeling of his heart, the firmost principle of  his nature. Nothing overrides it. Even "out of the depths" his soul cries to the Lord (see <a href="../../par/psalms/130-1.htm">Psalm 130:1</a>).

It may mean, <span class="accented">Oh that he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God himself) <span class="accented">would plead for a man with God! i.e.</span> would become a Mediator between himself and man, plead for him, undertake his defence, and obtain for him merciful consideration.

But if we prefer the other rendering, "as the Son of man," a Messianic interpretation will be necessary.

It is occupied mainly with Job's complaints of his treatment by his friends, and his lamentations over his sufferings (vers. 1-12). At the end he appeals to the grave, as the only hope or comfort left to him (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My breath is corrupt</span>; or, <span class="accented">my spirit is oppressed.</span> But the physical meaning is the more probable one. A fetid breath is one of the surest signs of approaching dissolution. <span class="cmt_word">My days are extinct</span>; or, <span class="accented">cut off</span>. The verb used does not occur elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">The graves are ready for me</span>; or, <span class="accented">the chambers of the grave are mine already.</span> The plural form is best explained by regarding it as referring to the niches commonly cut in a sepulchral chamber to receive the bodies of the departed (see Smith's  'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. pp. 1528-1536).

The terms used in this verse are law terms. Job calls upon God to go into court with him, and, first of all, to deposit the caution-money which the court will require before it undertakes the investigation of the case. Next, he goes on to say, <span class="cmt_word">put me in a surety with thee</span>; or rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">be surety for me with thyself</span> which is either the same thing with giving a pledge, or a further legal requirement. Finally, he asks the question, <span class="cmt_word">Who is he that will strike hands with me?</span> meaning, "Who else is there but thyself, to whom I can look to be my surety, and by striking hands (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>) with me to accept the legal responsibility?" As Dr. Stanley Leathes says, "It is wonderful the way in which the language of Job fits in with what we have since and elsewhere learnt concerning the Persons in the Godhead."

God, by the unprecedented character of his afflictions, has made Job a byword among the surrounding nations - a byword, that is, for an afflicted person. Job, by the manner in which he bore his afflictions, made himself a byword for patience and endurance among God's people throughout all ages (see <a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">aforetime I was as a tabret</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">am become an abomination before them</span>; or, as our Revisers translate, 1 <span class="accented">am become an open abhorring</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>).

When Job's case comes to beknown, "upright men" will be astonished at it. They will marvel how it came to pass that such a man - so true, so faithful, so "perfect" (<a href="../../par/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>) - could have been allowed by God to suffer so terribly. In a world where, up to Job's time, prosperity had been taken as the measure of goodness, the marvel was naturally great. Even now many a Christian is surprised and disturbed in mind if he gives the case prolonged and serious attention, though he holds the clue to it in that most enlightening phrase, "perfect through sufferings" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. On astonishment will follow indignation. When it becomes generally recognized that, in a vast number of cases, the righteous suffer, while the wicked enjoy great prosperity, good men's feelings will be stirred up against these prosperous ones; they will wax indignant, and take part against them.

The idea that the soul is still with the body in the grave, more or less closely attached to it, and sensible of its condition and changes, was widely prevalent in the ancient world. Where bodies were simply buried, the horrible imagination of a close association with corruption naturally and almost necessarily intruded itself, and led to such reflections as those of Job in this verse. It was partly to get rid of this terrible nightmare that the Egyptians were so careful to embalm the bodies of their dead, and that the Babylonians deposited them in baked clay coffins, which they filled with honey (Herod., 1:198); while others still more effectually prevented the process of corruption by cremation. The modern revival of cremation is remarkable as indicating a peculiar form of atavism or recurrence to ancient types. For many ages after the coming of Christ, men so separated between the soul and the body after death that the corruption of the grave had no horror for them. Now materialistic ideas have so far recurred, that many of those who believe the soul to live on after death are doubtful whether it may not still be attached to the body more or less, end, dreading contact with the corruption, of the latter, fall back upon the old remedy. <span class="cmt_word">To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister</span>.

At first sight it might seem that to cue in Sheol there could be no hope. But Job is too conscious of his own ignorance to dogmatize on such a subject. What does he know of Sheol? How can he be sure that it is "God's last word to men"?

There is great difficulty in determining the subject to the verb "go down," which is the third person plural <span class="accented">feminine</span>, whereas the only plural substantive at all near - the word translated "bars" - is masculine. Some suppose Job's <span class="accented">hopes</span> to be meant, "hope" in the preceding verse having the force of any number of "hopes" (so the R.V.) Others disregard the grammatical difficulty of the plural <span class="accented">feminine</span> verb, and, making "bars" the nominative, translate, "The bars of Sheol shall go down," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be broken down, perish;" or interrogatively, "Shall the bars of Sheol go down?" This rendering is thought to be "in harmony with the whole undercurrent of thought in the chapter;" but it has not approved itself to many commentators.

Job had spoken of his "miserable comforters" as "ungodly and wicked" (<a href="../../par/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a>), without wisdom (<a href="../../par/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>) and without understanding (<a href="../../par/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>). But he had not said that they were "unclean." Bildad, therefore, misrepresents him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teareth himself in his anger</span>. The Hebrew idiom, which allows of rapid transitions from the second to the third person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, cannot be transferred without harshness to our modern speech. Our Revisers have given the true force of the original by discarding the third person, and translating, "Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger." There is probably an allusion to <a href="../../par/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where Job had represented God as "tearing him in his wrath." Bildad says it is not God who tests him - he tears himself. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Shall the course of the world be altered to meet thy wishes, to suit thy case?" Job had wished for all manner of impossible things (<a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>). Bildad's reproach is thus not wholly unjust. But he makes no allowance for the wild utter-shoes of one who is half distraught. <span class="cmt_word">And shall the rock be removed out of his place?</span> Shall that which is most solid and firm give way, and alter its nature? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-21.</span> - Bildad, from this point, turns wholly to denunciation. He strings together a long series of menaces - probably ancient saws, drawn from "the wisdom of the Beni Kedem" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), and descriptive of the wretched fate of the wicked man, with whom he identifies Job. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out</span>. Whatever the wicked man may at any time have acquired of splendour, glory, honour, wealth, or prosperity, shall be taken from him, and as it were extinguished. <span class="cmt_word">And the spark of his fire shall not shine</span>.

This is not, as Rosenmuller asserts, a mere repetition of the thought contained in the preceding verse with a change of terms, and a variation of metaphor. It is a denunciation of woe to the whole <span class="accented">house</span> of the ungodly man, not to himself only. As Schultens says, "Lumen ob-tenebratum <span class="accented">in tentorio</span> est fortuna <span class="accented">domus</span> extincta." <span class="cmt_word">And his candle shall be put out with him</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">his!amp above him shall be put out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lamp which swings above him in his tent, or in his chamber, shall be extinguished.

In the time of his prosperity the wicked man had a wide sphere within which to exercise his activity, and strode hither and thither at his pleasure. When punishment falls on him, his "steps will be straitened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his sphere narrowed, his activity cramped, his powers "cabined, cribbed, confined." <span class="cmt_word">And his own counsel shall cast him down</span> (see <a href="../../par/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>,-16; 9:16; 10:2; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>).

Fifty years ago man-traps were commonly set at night in gardens and orchards in this country, which held intending thieves until the proprietor came and took them before a magistrate in the morning. (On the employment of such traps in antiquity, see Herod., 2:121. &sect; 2.)

Six different kinds of traps or snares are mentioned, "the speaker heaping together every word that he can find descriptive of the art of snaring." The art had been well studied by the Egyptians long before the age of Job, and a great variety of contrivances for capturing both beasts and birds are represented on the very early monuments (Wilkinson, in the authors' Herodotus,' vol. it. pp. 77, 78). We may conclude from this passage that it had also been brought to an advanced stage of excellence in Syria and Arabia.

Vague fears, panic terrors, no longer subjective, but to his bewildered brain objective, shall seem to menace the wicked man on every side, and shall affright him continually. There is an allusion, doubtless, to what Job has said of the  gloomy and terrifying thoughts which come over him from time to time (<a href="../../par/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>) and fill him with consternation. <span class="cmt_word">And shall drive him to his feet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall chase him at his</span> heels (see the Revised Version). Like a pack of hounds, or wolves, or jackals. Jackals are common in Palestine and the adjacent countries. They hunt in lacks, and generally run down their prey; but do not, unless hard pressed by hunger, attack men.

(So Dillmann, Cook, and the Revised Version.) To the other sufferings of the wicked man shall be added the pangs of hunger. His bodily strength shall disappear, as destitution and famine come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And destruction shall be ready at his side</span>. Ready to seize on him at any moment. Some translate, "ready for his halting" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ready to seize on him in ease of his tripping or halting (so the Revised Version).

The general meaning is plain, that destruction shall always be close to him, and shall ultimately make him its own. <span class="cmt_word">Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength</span>. By "the firstborn of death" is probably intended, either some wasting disease generally, or perhaps the special disease from which Job is suffering.

Probably death, rather than Satan, is intended. None of Job's "comforters" seems to have had any conception of Satan as a personal being, nor even Job himself.

This is always spoken of in Scripture as a great calamity, one of the greatest that can befall a man. It was felt as such, not only by the Jews, but by the Semitic people generally, whose earnest desire to perpetuate their memory is shown by the elaborate monuments and lengthy inscriptions which they set up in so many places. Arabian poetry, no less than Jewish, is penetrated by the idea. In one point of view it may seem a vulgar ambition; but, in another, it is a pathetic craving alter that continuance which the spirit of man naturally desires, but of which it has, apart from revelation, no assurance. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall have no name in the street</span>; or, <span class="accented">in the world without</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>).

If you have no sense of justice, and are disinclined to pay any heed to my expostulations; if you intend still to insist on magnifying yourselves against me, and bringing up against me my "reproach;" then let me make appeal to your pity. Consider my whole condition - how I stand with God, who persecutes me and "destroys" me (ver. 10); how I stand with my relatives and such other friends as I have beside yourselves, who disclaim and forsake me (vers. 13-19); and how I am conditioned with respect to my body, emaciated and on the verge of death (ver. 20); and then, if neither your friendship nor your sense of justice will induce you to abstain from persecuting me, abstain at any rate for pity's sake (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">And plead against me my reproach</span>. Job's special "reproach" was that God had laid his hand upon him. This was a manifest fact, and could not be denied. His "comforters" concluded from it that he was a monster of wickedness.

Professor Lee thinks that the net, or rather noose, intended by the rare word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> is the <span class="accented">lasso</span>' which was certainly employed in war (Herod., 7:85), and probably also in hunting, from ancient times in the East. Bildad had insinuated that Job had fallen into his own snare (<a href="../../par/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7-9</a>); Job replies that the snare in which he is taken is from God.

His ruin is complete - he perishes. <span class="cmt_word">And mine hope hath he removed like a tree</span>; rather, <span class="accented">torn up like a tree.</span> Job's "hope" was, no doubt, to lead a tranquil and a godly life, surrounded by his relatives and friends, in favour with God and man, till old age came, and he descended, like a ripe shock of corn (<a href="../../par/job/5-26.htm">Job 5:26</a>), to the grave. This hope had been "torn up by the roots" when his calamities fell upon him.

It is not what has happened to him in the way of affliction and calamity that so much oppresses and crushes the patriarch, as the <span class="accented">cause to</span> which he, not unnaturally, ascribes his afflictions, vie. the wrath of God. Participating in the general creed of his time, he believes his sufferings to come direct from God, and to be proofs of God's severe anger against him. He is not, however, prepared on this account to renounce God. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (<a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>) is still his inward sustaining thought and guiding principle. <span class="cmt_word">And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies</span>. Job felt himself treated as an enemy of God, and supposed that God must consider him such. He either had no glimpse of the cheering truth, "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), or he could not imagine that such woes as his were mere chastenings.

It seems to Job that God brings against him a whole army of assailants, who join their forces together and proceed to the attack. Clouds of archers, troops of ravagers, come about him, and fall upon him from every side. <span class="cmt_word">And raise up their way against me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and cast up their bank against</span> me. Job still regards himself as a besieged city (see ver. 10), and represents his assailants as raising embankments to hem him in, or mounds from which to batter his defences (compare the Assyrian sculptures, <span class="accented">passim</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And encamp round about my tabernacle</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my tent," or "my dwelling."

Their alienation from him during the period of his afflictions he here regards as among the trials laid upon him by God.

The breath of a sufferer from elephantiasis has often a fetid odour which is extremely disagreeable. Job's wife, it would seem, held aloof from him on this account, so that he lost the tender offices which a wife is the fittest person to render. <span class="cmt_word">Though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</span> This translation is scarcely tenable, though no doubt it gives to the words used a most touching and pathetic sense.

But the rendering of the Authorized Version receives support from <a href="../../par/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>. The forwardness of rude and ill-trained children to take part against God's saints appears later in the history of Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23, 24</a>).

The saints of God in all ages, and however differently circumstanced, are assailed by almost the same trials and temptations. Whether it be Job, or David, or Jeremiah, or One greater than any of them, the desertion and unkindness of their nearest and dearest, as the bitterest of all sufferings, is almost sure to be included in their cup, which they must drink to the dregs, if they are to experience to the full "the precious uses of adversity." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a></div><div class="verse">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh</span>. Here the third source of Job's misery is brought forward - his painful and incurable disease. This has brought him to such a pitch of emaciation that his bones seem to adhere to the tightened skin, and the scanty and shrunken muscles, that cover them (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>). Such emaciation of the general frame is quite compatible with the unsightly swelling of certain parts of the body which characterizes elephantiasis<span class="cmt_word">.

On the enumeration of his various woes, Job's appeal for pity follows. We must not regard it as addressed merely to the three so-called "friends" (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>) or "comforters" (<a href="../../par/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>), Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. It is an appeal to all those who are around him and about him, whose sympathies have been bither to estranged (vers. 13-19), but whose regard he does not despair of winning back. Will they not, when they perceive the extremity and variety of his sufferings, be moved to compassion by them, and commiserate him in his day of calamity? <span class="cmt_word">For the hand of God hath touched me</span>. To the "comforters" this is no argument. They deem him unworthy of pity on the very ground that he is "smitten of God, and afflicted" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); since they hold that, being so smitten, he must have' deserved his calamity. But to unprejudiced persons, not wedded to a theory, such an aggravation of his woe would naturally seem to render him a greater object of pity and compassion.

As there is nothing that is very remarkable in the preceding words, whereas the latter are among the most striking in the book, the general opinion has been that he refers to these last. It is now universally allowed, even by those whose date for Job is the most remote, that books were common long before his time, and so that he might naturally have been familiar with them. Writing is, of course, even anterior to books, and was certainly in use before  <span class="date">B.C. 2000</span>. The earliest writing was probably on stone or brick, and was perhaps in every case hieroglyphical. When writing on papyrus, or parchment, or the bark of trees, came into use, a cursive character soon superseded the hieroglyphical, though the latter continued In be employed for religious purposes, and for inscriptions on stone. <span class="cmt_word">Oh that they were printed in a book!</span> rather, <span class="accented">inscribed</span>, or <span class="accented">engraved.</span> The impression of the characters below the surface of the writing material, as in the Babylonian and Assyrian clay-tablets, seems to be pointed at. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a></div><div class="verse">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</span> A peculiar kind of rock-inscription, of which, so far as I know, no specimens remain, appears to be here alluded to. Job wished the characters of his record to be cut deep into the rock with an iron chisel, and the incision made to be then filled up with lead (compare the mediaeval "brasses"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a></div><div class="verse">For I know <i>that</i> my redeemer liveth, and <i>that</i> he shall stand at the latter <i>day</i> upon the earth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know that my Redeemer liveth</span>. Numerous endeavours have been made to explain away the mysterious import of this verse. First, it is noted that a goel is any one who avenges or ransoms another, and especially that it is "the technical expression for the avenger of blood" (Froude, 'Short Stories,' vol. 1. p. 284) so often mentioned in the Old Testament. It is suggested, therefore, that Job's real meaning may be that he expects one of his relatives to arise after his death as the avenger of his blood, and to exact retribution for it. But unless in the case of a violent death at the hands of a man, which was not what Job expected for himself, there could be no avenger of blood. Job has already expressed his desire to have a <span class="accented">thirdsman</span> between him and God (<a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>), which thirdsman can scarcely be other than a Divine Personage. In <a href="../../par/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a> be has declared his conviction that" his <span class="accented">Witness</span> is in heaven." In ver. 21 of the same chapter he longs to have an <span class="accented">advocate</span> to plead his cause with God. In <a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a> he calls upon God to be <span class="accented">Surety</span> for him. Therefore, as Dr. Stanley Leathes points out, "he has already recognized God <span class="accented">as his Judge</span> his <span class="accented">Umpire</span> his <span class="accented">Advocate</span> his <span class="accented">Witness</span> and his <span class="accented">Surety</span> in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after, and aspiration for,  some one to act in that capacity." After all this, it is not taking a very long step in advance to see and acknowledge in God his Goel, or "Redeemer." <span class="cmt_word">And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and that at the last he shall stand up over my dust.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is not "one who comes after me;" but, if a noun, "the last <span class="accented">one</span>" <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is "the first one "(<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>); if intended adverbially, "at the last" - <span class="accented">i.e</span>, at the end of all things. "At the latter day" is not an improper translation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>though</i> after my skin <i>worms</i> destroy this <i>body</i>, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And though after my skin worms destroy this body</span>. The supposed ellipsis of "worms" is improbable, as is also that of "body." Translate, <span class="accented">and after my skin has been thus destroyed -</span> "thus" meaning, "as you see it before your eyes." <span class="cmt_word">Yet in my flesh shall I see God</span>; literally, from <span class="accented">my flesh</span>  - scarcely, as Renan takes it, "without my flesh," or "away from my flesh" - "prive de ma chair;" but rather, "from the standpoint of my flesh " - "in my body," not "out of my body" - shall I see God. This may be taken merely as a prophecy of the theophany recorded in ch. 38-42. (see especially <a href="../../par/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>). But the nexus with ver. 25, and the expressions there used - "at the last," and "he shall stand up over my dust" - fully justify the traditional exegesis, which sees in the passage an avowal by Job of his confidence that he will see God "from his body" at the resurrection.

I myself, retaining my personal identity, "the same true living man," shall with my own eyes look on my Redeemer. Though <span class="cmt_word">my reins be consumed within me</span>. There is no "though "in the original. The clause is detached and independent, nor is it very easy to trace any connection between it and the rest of the verse. Schultens, however, thinks Job to mean that he is internally consumed by a burning desire to see the sight of which he has spoken. (So also Dr. Stanley Leathes.)

This opening presents to us the Book of Job as a detached work, separate from and independent of all others. The historical books are generally united each to each by the <span class="accented">you</span> connective. In the land of Us. Uz, or Huz (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e5;</span>), seems to have been originally, like Judah, Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., the name of a man. It was borne by a son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), and again by a son of Dishan, the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-28.htm">Genesis 36:28</a>). Some regard it as also a personal name in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. But from this use it passed to the descendants of one or more of these patriarchs, and from them to the country or countries which they inhabited. The "land of Uz" is spoken of, not only in this passage, but also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>. These last-cited places seem to show that Jeremiah's "land of Uz" was in or near Edom, and therefore south of Palestine; but as Uzzites, like so many nations of these ports, were migratory, we need not be surprised if the name Uz was, at different times, attached to various localities. Arabian tradition regards the region of the Hauran, north-east of Palestine, as Job's country. The other geographical names in the Book of Job point to a more eastern location, one not far remote from the southern Euphrates, and the adjacent parts of Arabia Sheba, Dedan, Teman, Buz, Shuah, and Chesed (Casdim) all point to this locality. On the other hand, there is a passage in the inscriptions of Asshur-banipal (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 650-625</span>) which, associating together the names of Huz and Buz (Khazu and Bazu), appears to place them both in Central Arabia, not far from the Jebel Shnmmar ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 470). My own conclusion would be that, while the name "land of Uz" designated at various periods various localities, Job's "land of Uz" lay a little west of the Lower Euphrates, on the borders of Chaldea and Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Job</span>. In the Hebrew the name is "Iyyob," whence the "Eyoub" of the Arabs and the "Hiob" of the Germans. It is quite a distinct name from that of the third son of Issachar (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-18.htm">Genesis 46:18</a>), which is properly expressed by "Job," being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. <span class="accented">Iyyob is</span> supposed to be derived from <span class="accented">aib</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>), "to be hostile," and to mean "cruelly or hostilely treated," in which ease we must suppose it to have been first given to the patriarch in his later life, and to have superseded some other, as "Peter" superseded "Simon," and "Paul" superseded  "Saul." According to a Jewish tradition, adopted by some of the Christian Fathers, Job's original name was "Jobab," and under this name he reigned as King of Edom (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>). But this kingship is scarcely compatible with the view given of him in the Book of Job. The supposed connection of the name of Juba with that of Job is very doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">And that man was perfect</span><span class="accented">. Tam</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the word translated "perfect," seems to mean "complete, entire, not wanting in any respect," It corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">integer</span> (comp. Horace, 'Od.,' 1:22. 1, "Integer vitro, scelerisque purus'). It does not mean" absolutely sinless," which Job was not (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). And upright. This is the exact meaning of <span class="accented">yashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). "The Book of Jasher" was "the Book of the Upright" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). One that feared God, and eschewed evil; literally, <span class="accented">fearing God and departing from evil</span>. The same testimony is given of Job by God himself in ver. 8, and again in <a href="../../par/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>). We must suppose Job to have reached as near perfection as was possible tot man at the time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters</span>. The numbers three and seven, and their product, ten, are certainly sacred numbers, regarded as expressive of ideal perfection. But this does not prevent their being also historical. As Canon Cook observes, "Striking coincidences between outward facts and ideal numbers are not uncommon in the purely historical portions of Scripture" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 20). There are <span class="accented">twelve</span> apostles, <span class="accented">seventy</span> (7 &times; 10) disciples sent out by our Lord, <span class="accented">seven</span> deacons, three synoptic Gospels, <span class="accented">twelve</span> minor prophets, seven princes of Persia and Media, ten sons of Haman, three of Noah, Gomer, Terah, Levi, and Zeruiah, <span class="accented">seven</span> of Japhet, Mizraim, Seir the Horite, Gad, and Jesse (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>), <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Ishmael, <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Jacob, etc. Our Lord is <span class="accented">thirty</span> (3 x 10) years old when he begins to teach, and his ministry lasts <span class="accented">three</span> years; he heals <span class="accented">seven</span> lepers, casts out of Mary Magdalene <span class="accented">seven</span> devils, speaks upon the cross <span class="accented">seven</span> "words," bids Peter forgive his brother "<span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven," etc. It is thus not only in vision or in prophecy, or in symbolical language, that these "ideal numbers" come to the front far more frequently than ethers, but also in the most matter-of-fact histories. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His substance also</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his acquisition</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">acquirere</span>), but used of wealth generally. <span class="cmt_word">Seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses</span>. Note, first of all, the absence of horses or mules from this list - an indication of high antiquity. Horses were not known in Egypt till the time of the shepherd-kings (about  <span class="date">B.C. 1900-1650</span>), who introduced them from Asia. None are given to Abraham by the Pharaoh contemporary with him (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). We hear of none as possessed by the patriarchs in Palestine; and, on the whole, it is not probable that they had been known in Western Asia very long before their introduction into Egypt. They are natives of Central Asia, where they are still found wild, and passed gradually by exportation to the more southern regions, Armenia, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Arabia. Note, secondly, that the items of Job's wealth accord with those of Abraham's (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). Thirdly, note that Job's wealth in cattle is not beyond credibility. An Egyptian lord of the time of the fourth dynasty relates that he possessed above 1000 oxen and cows, 974 sheep, 2,235 goals, and 760 asses (Rawlinson's 'Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 88). Further, the proportion of the camels is noticeable, and implies a residence on the borders of the desert (see the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">and a very great household</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and a very great service</span>, or <span class="accented">retinue of servants.</span> Oriental emirs and sheikhs consider it necessary for their dignity to maintain a number of attendants and retainers (except, perhaps, in feudal times) quite unknown to the West. Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). Egyptian households were "full of domestics," comprising attendants of all kinds - grooms, artisans, clerks, musicians, messengers, and the like. A sheikh, situated as Job was, would also require a certain number of guards, while for his cattle he would need a large body of shepherds, ox-herds, and the like (see Birch's 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 44<span class="cmt_word">). So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east</span>. The <span class="accented">Beney Kedem</span>, or "men of the east," literally, <span class="accented">sons of the east</span>, seems to include the entire population between Palestine and the Euphrates (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>, etc.). Many tribes of Arabs are similarly designated at the present day, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Beni Harb, the Beni Suhr, the Bani Naim, the Bani Lain, etc. It would seem that the Phoenicians must have called themselves Beni Kedem when they settled in Greece, since the Greeks knew them as "Cadmeisns," and made them descendants of a mythic "Cadreus' (Herod., 5:57-59). The name "Saracens" is to some extent analogous, since it means "Men of the morning." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And his sons went and feasted <i>in their</i> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his sons went and feasted</span>. "Went and feasted" seems to mean "were  in the habit of feastlng" (Rosenmuller, Lee). In their houses. Each had his own residence, and the residence was not a tent, but a" house." Job and his sons were not mere nomads, but belonged to the settled population. The same is implied by the "ploughing of the oxen" (ver. 14), and indeed by Job's "yoke of oxen" in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Every one his day</span>. Most commentators regard these feasts as birthday festivities. Each son in his turn, when his birthday arrived, entertained his six brothers. Others think that each of the seven brothers had his own special day of the week on which, he received his brothers at his table, so that the feasting was continuous. But this scarcely suits the context. And it is admitted that "his day" (in <a href="../../par/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>) means "his birthday." The celebration of birthdays by means of a feast was a very widespread custom in the East (see <a href="../../par/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>; Herod., 1:133; 9:110; <a href="../../par/mark/14-21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>). And sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. This by itself is sufficient to show that the feasts were occasional, not continuous. Constant absence of daughters, day after day, from the parental board is inconceivable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it was so, when the days of <i>their</i> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <i>according</i> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when the days of the feasting had come round</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the birthdays had arrived in due course, and the feasting had taken place. That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings</span>. Burnt offerings were instituted soon after the Fall, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>, and were in common use long before the Mosaic Law was given (see <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 20, 21; vol. 12. pp. 49, 71, etc.). The practice was common, so far as appears, to all the nations of antiquity, except the Persians (Herod., 1:132). According to the number of them all One, apparently, for each child, since each might have sinned in the way suggested. The offerings were clearly it. tended as expiatory. <span class="cmt_word">For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts</span>. Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. According to some, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has its usual sense, "to bless," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> signifies "false gods," or "idols;" according to the others, who form the great majority, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> has its usual sense of "God," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has the unusual sense of "curse" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of "to bless" and "to curse" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> got the sense of "bidding adieu to," "dismissing," "renouncing." Others regard the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> for "to curse" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of <span class="accented">sacer</span> and <span class="accented">sacrari</span> in Latin, and such expressions as "<span class="accented">Bless</span> the stupid man!" "What a <span class="accented">blessed</span> nuisance!" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by <a href="../../par/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. By "cursing God in their hearts" Job probably means "forgetting him," "putting him out of sight," "not giving him the honour which is his due." <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Job continually</span>; literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">all the days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the festival-days occurred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord</span>. By "the sons of God" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in <a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. Angels and men are alike "sons of God," as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the "Only Begotten," is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and <a href="../../par/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a> that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings<span class="cmt_word">. And Satan came also among them</span>. The word "Satan" has the article prefixed to it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> here and elsewhere in Job, as in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a> and in <a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - "the adversary" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, <span class="accented">passim</span>. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>), who is "the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses  them before God day and night" (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Slanderer." The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (<a href="../../par/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.), and the descriptive epithet, "the Adversary," is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (<span class="accented">Angro-mainyus</span>) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113).

He searches the whole earth continually, never passing, never resting, but "going about<span class="accented"></span>," as St. Peter says (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), "like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour," waiting till the coming of the "thousand years," when an angel will "bind him with a great chain, and cast him into the bottom-less pit" (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 2</a>). It will be a happy day for the earth when that time comes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered?</span> literally. <span class="accented">Hast thou set thine heart on?</span> equivalent to "Hast thou given thine attention to?"

It is a high honour to any man for God to acknowledge him as his servant (see <a href="../../par/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That there is none like him in the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for there is none like him</span> (see the Revised Version).

He serves God, not for love of God, or for love of goodness, but for what he gets by it. Satan is too shrewd to endeavour, as Job's friends do later, to pick holes in Job's conduct. No; that is exemplary. But the true character of acts is determined by the motive. What is Job's motive? Does he not serve God to gain his protection and blessing? Similarly, in modern times, ungodly men argue that religious and devout persons are religious and devout with a view to their own interest, because they expect to gain by it, either in this world, or in the next, or in both. This is a form of calumny which it is impossible to escape. And bad men, who are conscious to themselves of never acting except from a selfish motive, may well imagine the same of others. It is rarely that such an insinuation can be disproved. In the present instance God vindicates his servant, and covers the adversary with shame, as the other adversaries and calumniators of righteousness will be covered at the last day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast not thou made an hedge about him?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "hedged him around, protected him, made a sort of invisible fence about him, through which no evil could creep." This was undoubtedly true. God had so protected him. But the question was not as to this fact, but as to Job's motive. Was it mere prudence? - the desire to secure a continuance of this protection? <span class="cmt_word">And about his house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his family" - his sons and daughters - the members of his household. <span class="cmt_word">And about all that he hath on every side</span>. His possessions - land, houses, cattle, live stock of all kinds, furniture, goods and chattels. Thou hast blessed the work of his hands (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where it is said of the righteous man. that "whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper"). So it was with Job. God's blessing was upon him, and success crowned all his enterprises. "The work of his hands" will include everything that he attempted. <span class="cmt_word">And his substance is increased in the land</span>. In the former clause we have the cause, God's blessing; in the latter the effect, a great increase in Job's "substance," or "cattle" (marginal reading). (On the final number of his cattle, see ver. 3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But put forth thine hand now</span>; literally, <span class="accented">send forth thy hand</span>, as a man does who strikes a blow (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/9-15.htm">Exodus 9:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And touch all that he hath</span>; or, <span class="accented">smite all that he hath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ruin him, strip him of his possessions. And he will curse thee to thy face. Professor  Lee translates, "If not, he will bless thee to thy face;" the LXX., "Surely he will bless thee to thy face;" Canon Cook, "See if he will not renounce thee openly." But the majority of Hebraists agree with the Authorized Version. Satan suggests that, if Job be stripped of his possessions, he will openly curse God, and renounce his worship. Here he did not so much calumniate, or lie, as show the evil thoughts that were in his own heart. No doubt he believed that Job would act as he said. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is</i> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.

God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. <span class="cmt_word">Only upon himself put not forth thine hand</span>. The <span class="accented">person</span> of Job was not to be touched as yet. He was to be injured only in his belongings. <span class="cmt_word">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord</span>. Having obtained a permission which he thought would serve his purpose, Satan did not delay, but promptly departed, to take advantage of the permission given him. To be in the presence of God must be an intense pain to the evil one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house</span>. One of the birthdays, the eldest brother's probably, had come round, and the ordinary gathering (see ver. 4) had taken place - the feasting and drinking had begun, while the father, remaining in his own house, was perhaps interceding with God for his children, or anxiously considering the possibility that, in their light-hearted merriment, they might have put God away altogether from their thoughts, and So have practically renounced him, when the series of calamities began. How often calamity comes to us when we are least expecting it, when all seems quiet about us, when everything is prospering - nay, even when a high festival-time has come, and the joy-bells are sounding in our ears, and our 'hearts are elated within us! Job was, at any rate, spared the sudden plunge from exuberant joy into the depths of woe. It was his habit to preserve an even temper, and neither to be greatly exalted, nor, unless under an extremity of suffering, to be greatly depressed. He was now, however, about to be subjected to a fiery trial.

Note that, notwithstanding the festival, labour was still going on; there was no general holiday; the oxen were at work in the field, not perhaps all of them, but the greater number, for the ploughing-time is short in the Oriental countries, and the "earing" is all done at the same time. The bulk of Job's labourers were probably engaged in the business, and they had brought the asses with them, probably to keep them under their eye, lest thieves should carry them off, when the catastrophe related in the next verse occurred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them</i>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Sabeans</span> (literally, Sheba) <span class="cmt_word">fell upon them, and took them away</span>.

We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known. Strabo says that the Sabeans, even at the height of their prosperity, made excursions for the sake of plunder into Arabia Petraea and even Syria (Strab., 16:4) <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have slain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they slew</span>, or <span class="accented">they smote. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the labourers who were engaged in ploughing, and would be in duty bound to resist the carrying off of the cattle. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>.

Some derive the Hebrew <span class="accented">Casdim</span> from "Chesed," one of the sons of Nahor (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22</a>); but Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees before Chesed was born (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>). And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, &sect; 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20). From a remote date they were a settled and civilized people; but no doubt originally they had the same predatory instincts as their neighbours<span class="cmt_word">. Made out three bands</span>. Professor Lee translates, "appointed three captains," which is a possible meaning of the words; but the weight of authority supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">And fell upon the camels</span>.

Three thousand camels would be regarded as a splendid capture by any body of Oriental marauders. <span class="cmt_word">And have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants</span> (literally, the <span class="accented">young men</span>, as in ver. 16) <span class="cmt_word">with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span> (compare the comment on ver. 15).

It is a common proverb that "misfortunes never come singly." Shakespeare says they "come not single foes, but in battalions." Still, so overwhelming a series of calamities falling upon a single individual all in one day could not but strike those who heard of them as abnormal, and almost certainly supernatural. So Job's friends concluded (<a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>).

The desert winds are often very violent. Generally they are Laden with heavy clouds of fine sand, which cause intolerable discomfort and thirst; but when they sweep over a rocky and gravelly region, they are simply of extreme violence, without other distressing feature. They then resemble the hurricanes or tornadoes of the West Indies. We may reasonably connect this hurricane with the thunderstorm of ver. 16<span class="cmt_word">.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither</span>. There is some difficulty in the word "thither," since no man returns to his mother's womb (<a href="../../par/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>), at death or otherwise. The expression must not be pressed. It arises out of the analogy, constantly felt and acknowledged, between "mother" earth and a man's actual mother (setup. Psalm 129:15). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away</span>. Job is here represented as knowing God by his name "Jehovah," though elsewhere the "great Name" appears once only in the words of Job (<a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>), and never in the words of his friends. The natural <span class="accented">conclusion is</span> that the name was known in the land of Uz at the time, but was very rarely used - scarcely, except in moments of excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Name of the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">may the Name of Jehovah be blessed!</span> The ermphatic word is kept for the last. According to Satan, Job was to have" cursed God to his face" (ver. 11). The event is that he openly and resolutely blesses God. That the same word is used in its two opposite senses rather accentuates the antithesis.

He adds coarseness and rudeness to his former vehement hostility (vers. 7, 15). His whole discourse is a covert denunciation of Job as a wicked man and a hypocrite (vers. 5, 12, 19, 29), deservedly punished by God for a life of crime. He ends by prophesying Job's violent death, the destruction of his house, and the rising up of heaven and earth in witness against him (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, <span class="cmt_word">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer</span>.

Some suppose an allusion to <a href="../../par/job/19-2.htm">Job 19:2, 3</a>; but it is better to regard Zophar as enraged by vers. 28, 29 of <a href="../../par/job/19.htm">Job 19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer</span>. This claim is not quite consistent with the acknowledgment of hastiness in ver. 2.

The passage is among those which make for the high antiquity of the book. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is</i> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <i>but</i> for a moment?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the triumphing of the wicked is short</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-19</a>, etc.). This is one of the main points of dispute between Job and his opponents. It has been previously maintained by Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8-11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-3.htm">Job 5:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21, 29</a>) and by Bildad (<a href="../../par/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11-19</a>), as it is now by Zophar, and may be regarded as the traditional belief of the time, which scarcely any ventured to question. His own observation, however, has convinced Job that the fact is otherwise. He has seen the wicked "live, become old, and remain mighty in power" (<a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>); he has seen them "spend their days in wealth," and die quietly, as "in a moment" (<a href="../../par/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>). In <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a> he seems to argue that this is the general, if not universal, lot of such persons. Later on, however, in <a href="../../par/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13-23</a>, he retracts this view, or, at any rate, greatly modifies it, admitting that usually retribution does even in this life overtake the wicked. And this seems to be the general sentiment of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Raro antecedentem scelestum,<br />Deseruit pede poena claudlo."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Horace, 'Od.,' 3:2, ll. 31, 32.</span>) There remains, however, the question whether the triumphing of the wicked can fairly be considered "short," and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. When we consider the lives of Dionysius the elder, Sylla, Marius, Tiberius, Louis XIV., Napoleon, it is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative.

But the translation of the Authorized Version seems preferable. His children will curry favour with the poor, either by making restitution to them on account of their father's injuries, or simply because they are friendless, and desire to ingratiate themselves with some one. <span class="cmt_word">And his hands shall restore their goods</span> (comp. vers. 15 and 18).

It is, perhaps, the most surprising among the phenomena of wickedness that men can gloat over it, voluntarily recur to it, make a boast of it, recount signal instances of it to their friends, and seem to find a satisfaction in the recollection. One would have expected that shame and self-disapproval and fear of retribution would have led them to dismiss their wicked acts from their thoughts as soon as possible. But certainly the fact is otherwise.

Still, a time comes when the self-complacency of the wicked man is shaken. He experiences a failure of health or spirits. Then, suddenly, it is as if the meat that he has swallowed had been turned to poison in his bowels, as if the gall of asps were within him. Compare what Bishop Butler says of the sudden waking up of a man's conscience ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 2. p. 52). The ancients seem to have known that the poison of serpents was a strong acid, and therefore supposed that it was secreted by the gallbladder (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 11:37).

The wicked man shall be made to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. Either fear, or remorse, or a judicial sentence will force him to make restitution (see ver. 10). God shall cast them out of his belly.

Probably Zophar does not affix any very distinct meaning to his threats.

Job will be equally distressed in either ease. <span class="cmt_word">The viper's tongue shall slay him</span>. It is really the viper's <span class="accented">tooth</span>, and not his <span class="accented">tongue</span>, that slays; but Zophar is not, any more than Job (<a href="../../par/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>), an accomplished naturalist.

This is no indication of the late authorship of Job. Iron was in use in Egypt at a very early date. A thin plate of it was found by Colonel Howard Vyse embedded in the masonry of the great pyramid; and iron implements and ornaments, iron spear-heads, iron sickles, iron gimlets, iron keys, iron bracelets, iron wire, have been found in the early tombs not infrequently (see the author's 'History of Ancient  Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 505). That they are not more common is accounted for by the rapid oxidization of iron by exposure to the air, and its rapid decay in the nitrous soil of Egypt. The inhabitants of South-Western Asia were at no time much behind the Egyptians in their knowledge of the useful arts: and iron appears as a well-known metal in the Jewish Scriptures from the time of the Exodus (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a>). It is true that the principal weapons of war continued to be made ordinarily of bronze, both in South-Western Asia and in Egypt, till a comparatively late period; but Zophar may mean to assign to the slayer of the wicked man weapons of a superior character. <span class="cmt_word">And the bow of steel shall strike him through</span>. It is uncertain whether steel was known in the ancient world. But, whether or no, "steel" is not meant here. The word used in the original is <span class="accented">nehushtah</span>, which undoubtedly means either "copper" or "bronze." As copper would be too soft a material for a bow, we may assume bronze to be intended. The bronze used in Egypt was extremely elastic, and there would have been little difficulty in fashioning bows of it (on the existence of such bows, see 2 Samuel 26:5; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>).

After a few caustic introductory remarks (vers. 2-4), he takes up the challenge which Zophar had thrown out, respecting the certain punishment, in this life, of the wicked (<a href="../../par/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4-29</a>), and maintains, "in language of unparalleled boldness" (Cook), the converse of the proposition. The wicked, he says, live, grow old,  attain to great power, have a numerous and flourishing offspring, prosper, grow rich, spend their time in feasting and jollity - nay, openly renounce God and decline to pray to him - yet suffer no harm, and when they die, go down to the grave without suffering, "in a moment" (vers. 5-15). To the suggestion that from time to time they are cut off suddenly in a signal way, he answers, "How often is this?" or rather, "How seldom!" (vers. 17, 18). To the further suggestion that they are punished in their children he replies, "How much better if they were punished in their own persons!" (vers. 19-21). As it is, he argues, one event happens to all (vers. 23-26). In conclusion, he observes that common opinion supports his view (vers. 29-33), and denounces as futile the attempts of his comforters to convince him, since his views and theirs respecting the facts of God's government are diametrically opposed to each other (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Job answered and said, Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations</span>.

There is an emphasis on the "I" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span>). Job implies that his opponents are not allowing him his fair share of the argument, which is an accusation that can scarcely be justified. Since the dialogue opened, Job's speeches have occupied eleven chapters, those of his "comforters" seven only. But a controversialist who has much to say is apt to think that sufficient time is not allowed him. And after that I have spoken, mock on. Job does not hope to convince, or silence, or shame the other interlocutors. When he has said his say, all that he expects is mockery and derision.

Knowing that, in thus running counter to the general religious teaching, he will arouse much horror and indignation on the part of those who hear him, he prefaces his remarks with a notice that they will cause astonishment, and an acknowledgment that he himself cannot reflect upon the subject without a feeling of alarm and dismay. He thus hopes partially to disarm his opponents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "attend to me," <span class="cmt_word">for I am about to say something well worth attention</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And be astonished.

He has seen that "the wicked live" quite as long as the righteous, that in many cases they attain to a ripe old age, and become among the powerful of the earth. The great "pyramid kings" of Egypt, whose cruel oppressions were remembered down to the time of Herodotus (Herod., 2:124-128), reigned respectively, according to Egyptian tradition, sixty-three and sixty-six years(Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 2.). Rameses II., the cruel oppressor of the Jews, and the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled, had a reign of sixty-seven years ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 301).

The "timbrel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;</span>) is probably the tambourine, an instrument used from a remote antiquity by the Orientals. It consisted of a round hoop of wood, into which were sometimes inserted jingling rings of metal, and upon which was stretched at one end a sheet of parchment. It is represented on the monuments both of Egypt and Phoenicia ('Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 522; 'Hist. of Phoenicia,' pp. 219, 223). The harp (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>) was, in the early times, a very simple instrument, consisting of a framework of wood, across which were stretched from four to seven strings, which were of catgut and of different lengths, and were sounded either with the hand or with a plectrum. The "organ" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) was, of course, not an organ in the modern sense of the word. It was either a pan's pipe, which is a very primitive instrument, or more probably a double reed blown from the end, like a flageolet, examples of which are found in the remains both of Egypt and Phoenicia ('Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 524; 'Hist. of Phoenicia,' <span class="accented">l</span>.<span class="accented">s c.</span>).

It is this impunity which leads the wicked to renounce God altogether. They think that they get on very well without God, and consequently have no need to serve him. Job puts their thoughts into words (vers. 14, 15), and thus very graphically represents their tone of feeling. For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. The wicked feel no interest in God; they do not trouble themselves about him; his ways are "far above out of their sight," and they do not care to know them.

No, he says, a thousand times, No! <span class="cmt_word">The counsel of the wicked is far from me</span>; or better, <span class="accented">be the counsel of the wicked far from me!</span> I will have nothing to do with it. I will cling to God. I will maintain my integrity. Satan had charged Job with serving God for the sake of temporal reward. Job had disproved the charge by still clinging to God, notwithstanding all his afflictions. Now he goes further, and declines to throw in his lot with the wicked, even although it should appear that the balance of prosperity is with them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a></div><div class="verse">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and <i>how oft</i> cometh their destruction upon them! <i>God</i> distributeth sorrows in his anger.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out?</span> This is not an exclamation, but a question, and is well rendered in the Revised Version, "How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?" Is not the signal downfall of the wicked  prosperous man a comparatively rare occur-fence? How oft cometh their destruction upon them*. When the problem here propounded came before Asaph, he seems to have solved it by the supposition that in all cases retribution visited the wicked in this life, and that they were cast down from their prosperity. "I went," he says, "into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these men. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image" (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-20</a>). Job maintains that such a catastrophe happens but seldom, and that for the most part the wicked go down to the grave in peace. God distributeth sorrows in his anger. This is hot an independent clause. The sense runs on: <span class="accented">How off is it that the candle of the wicked is put out</span> <span class="accented">and that destruction cometh upon them</span> <span class="accented">and God showers sorrows upon them in his anger</span>? (compare the comment on the next verse).

The construction begun in the first clause of ver. 17 is carried on to the end of ver. 18.

Job supposes his opponents to make this answer to his arguments. "God," they may say, "punishes the wicked man in his children" (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Job does not deny that he may do so, but suggests a better course in the next sentence. <span class="cmt_word">He rewardeth him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let him recompense it on himself -</span> let him make the wicked man himself suffer, and then he shall know it.

Now, however, he cheeks himself with the confession that God's ways are inscrutable, his knowledge far beyond any knowledge possessed by man. Men must not presume to judge him; it is for him to judge them. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he judgeth those that are high</span>. None so exalted, none so advanced in wisdom and knowledge, none so venturesome in sounding depths that they cannot fathom, but God is above them, judges them, knows their hearts, and, according to his infallible wisdom, condemns or approves them. This is a chastening thought, and its effect on Job is to make him contract his sails, and, leaving the empyrean, content himself with s lower flight. Previously he has maintained, as if he were admitted to the Divine counsels, that the prosperity of the wicked was a rule of God's government. Now he goes no further than to say that there is no rule discoverable. Happiness and misery are dispensed - as far as man can see - on no definite principle, and, at the end, one lot happens to all: all go down into the tomb, and lie in the dust, and the worms devour them (vers. 23-26).

This, according to Job, was the popular sentiment of his time; and, no doubt, there is in all ages a large mass of fleeting opinion to the same effect. Striking examples of wickedness in high places draw attention, and provoke indignation, and are much talked about; whence arises an idea that such cases are common, and ultimately, by an unscientific generalization in the vulgar mind, that they form the rule, and not the exception to the rule. It requires some power of intellect to take a broad and comprehensive view over the whole of human life, and fairly to strike the balance. Such a view seems to have been taken by Bishop Butler (among others); and the conclusion, reached by calm investigation and philosophic thought, is that, on the whole, ever in this life, the balance of advantage rests with the virtuous, who really prosper more than the wicked, have greater and higher satisfactions, escape numerous forms of suffering, and approach more nearly to happiness. An exact apportionment of happiness and misery to desert is a thing that certainly in this life does not take place; but the <span class="accented">tendency</span> of virtue to accumulate to itself other goods is clear; and Job's pessimistic view is certainly an untrue one, which we may suspect that he maintained, rather from a love of paradox, and from a desire to puzzle and confuse his friends, than from any conviction of its absolute truth.

Even in death the advantage is still with the wicked man. He is borne in procession to the grave - a mausoleum or a family vault - by a long train of mourners, who weep and lament for him, and pay him funeral honours. The poor virtuous man, on the other hand, is hastily thrust under the soil. <span class="cmt_word">And shall remain in in the tomb</span>; <span class="accented">or shall keep watch over his tomb.</span> The allusion is probably to the custom, common certainly in Egypt and Phoenicia, of carving a figure of the deceased on the lid of his sarcophagus, to keep as it were watch over the remains deposited within. The figure was sometimes accompanied by an inscription, denouncing curses on those who should dare to violate the tomb or disturb the remains (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112-114; and compare the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' pp. 393-395).

The real reference is probably to the common topic of consolation implied in the "Omnes eodem cogimur" of Horace. He is happy in his death, or at any rate not unhappy, seeing that he only suffers the common fate. He will draw after him all future men, who will likewise inevitably perish, just as there are innumerable before him, who have travelled the same read and reached the same resting-place.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink</span>. To give water to the thirsty was regarded in the East as one of the most elementary duties of man to man. The self-justification of the dead in the Egyptian Hades contained the following passage: "I gave my bread to the hungry, <span class="accented">and drink to him that was athirst</span>; I clothed the naked with garments; I sheltered the wanderer" ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. CXXV. &sect; 38). The same claim appears continually on Egyptian tombs. "All men respected me," we read on one; "I <span class="accented">gave water to the thirsty</span>; I set the wanderer in his path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence" ('Non-Biblical Systems of Religion,' p. 46). In the proverbs assigned to Solomon, "which the men of Hezekiah copied out" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>), the duty was declared to be one owed even to enemies (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, <span class="accented">give him water to drink"</span>). Isaiah notices it as praiseworthy in the Temanites (Eliphaz's people), that they "<span class="accented">brought water to him that was thirsty</span> and prevented with their bread him that fled" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>). Jael is praised for going further than this: He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish" (<a href="../../par/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry</span>. Later on Job absolutely denies this, as well as many of the other charges. "If I have withheld," he says, "the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or <span class="accented">have eaten my morsel myself alone</span>, <span class="accented">and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof</span>," then let mine arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone" (<a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>).

Job's retainers are probably meant, whom Eliphaz supposes to have been allowed by Job to oppress the poor, and have their own way in the world. This charge was doubtless as baseless as the others (comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16, 17</a>).

Job had complained of the "darkness" that was "set in his paths" (<a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>), meaning probably his inability to discover the cause of his afflictions. <span class="cmt_word">And abundance of waters cover thee.</span> The comparison of severe affliction to an overwhelming flood is very common in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1-3, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>, etc.). So Shakespeare speaks of "a sea of troubles." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not God in the height of heaven?</span> From taxing Job with definite open sins, Eliphaz proceeds to accuse him of impious thoughts and principles. He  does not acknowledge, Eliphaz says, either the majesty or the omniscience of God. Here he has, at any rate, some tangible ground for his reproaches. Job's words have been over-bold, over-venturesome. He has seemed to forget the distance between God and man (<a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30-33</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, etc.), and to call in question either God's omniscience or his regard for moral distinctions (<a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13, 23-26</a>). Hence Eliphaz is enabled to take a high tone and ask, "Hast thou forgotten that God is in the height of heaven, far up above all us poor wretched mortals? Dost thou need to be reminded of this? He is above the stars, and yet behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Even they are infinitely above men, yet how far below <span class="accented">him</span>!" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/35-5.htm">Job 35:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a></div><div class="verse">And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou sayest, How doth God know?</span> Job had not said this in so many words, but, by equalizing the godly and the wicked (<a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23-26</a>), he might be supposed to mean that God took no note of men's conduct, and therefore had not a perfect knowledge of all things. The psalmist implies that many men so thought (<a href="../../par/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Can he judge through the dark cloud?</span> rather, <span class="accented">through the thick darkness.</span> God was supposed to dwell remote from man, in the highest heaven, and, according to many, "clouds and darkness were round about him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>) - he "dwelt in the thick darkness" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>) - he "made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him was waters, and thick clouds of the skies" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man. Job had not really ever shared in these doubts; but it suits Eliphaz's purpose to malign and misrepresent him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thick clouds <i>are</i> a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse); and he walketh in the circuit of heaven; or, on <span class="accented">the circumference of the heavens.</span> The heavens are regarded as a solid vault, <span class="accented">outside</span> which is the place where God dwells.

(see the Revised Version). Eliphaz assumes that it is Job's intention to cast in his lot with these persons whose prosperous wickedness he has described in the preceding chapter (vers. 7-15). And this notwithstanding Job's final protest, "Be the counsel of the wicked far from me" (ver. 16). He calls the mode of life pursued by these wicked persons "the old way," either with allusion to the seed of Cain before the Flood, who "corrupted their way" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>), or perhaps with reference to the descendants of Nimrod after it (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' p. 361).

And, What can the Almighty do for them? <span class="accented">i.e. and ask what the Almighty can do for them.</span> A change from the second to the third person, without any change of subject, is not unusual in Hebrew.

The idea is the same as that of <a href="../../par/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, though not expressed so pointedly. What Eliphaz thinks to gain by echoing Job's words is not very apparent.

And the innocent laugh them to scorn (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>).

It is best to take these as the words of the righteous in their triumph over the wicked; but they can scarcely bear the interpretation given them in the Authorized Version. The clause is not really negative but affirmative, and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. does not  mean "substance," but "adversary." Translate, <span class="accented">Surely they that rose up against us</span> (or, <span class="accented">our adversaries</span>) <span class="accented">are cut off</span>; and compare the Revised Version.

The "fire" here, like the "flood" in ver. 16, is a metaphor, and therefore not to be pressed. All that is essential is that the wicked are destroyed. Over this the "righteous" and the "innocent" rejoice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a></div><div class="verse">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-30.</span> - At this point a transition occurs. Eliphaz turns away from reproaches, open or covert, designed to exhibit Job as an example of extreme wickedness, and falls back on those topics which were the main subjects of his first exhortation (<a href="../../par/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8-27</a>), viz. an earnest appeal to Job to return to God, to repent and amend (vers. 21-23) and a lavish outpouring of promises, or prophecies, that in that case he should be delivered from all his troubles, should recover his wealth and prosperity, obtain of God all that he should pray for, succeed in all his enterprises, and be able to help and ease others, even those who might be guilty in God's sight (vers. 24-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Acquaint now thyself with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; or, make, <span class="accented">I beseech thee</span> <span class="accented">a trial of him</span>, <span class="accented">and be at peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> risk everything, throw thyself upon his mercy, and so make thy peace with him. To do so is well worth thy while, for thereby good shall come unto thee. It is a question what sort of "good" is meant. If we are to explain the "good" of this passage by vers. 24, 25 exclusively, Eliphaz will become a mere utilitarian, and he will be rightly characterized as "selfish and sordid" (Cook) - an anticipation of the Mammon of Milton. But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for singling out vers. 24, 25 from the rest of the passage, and regarding them as forming its key-note. The "good" which Eliphaz promises to Job includes, besides "the gold of Ophir" and "plenty of silver," such things as "delight in the Almighty," and confident trust in him (ver. 26), God's hearing of his prayers (ver. 27), the shining of light upon his path (ver. 28), his own payment of his vows (ver. 27), his giving assistance to the poor and needy (ver. 29), and even his deliverance of the guilty by the pureness of his hands (ver. 30); so that other besides material considerations are clearly taken into account, and the worldly prosperity which Eliphaz promises forms a part only of the good result which he anticipates from the patriarch making his peace with the Almighty.

The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, without the article prefixed, is properly "instruction," and is only to be assumed as meaning "the Law" when the context shows this meaning to be probable.

Let him follow Eliphaz's advice, "return to the Almighty" (ver. 23), humble himself in the dust, repent and "put away his iniquity" (ver. 23), and then, Eliphaz promises him, all shall be changed - God will become gracious to him, will listen to him, and grant his requests, will remove his heavy hand, and crown him with mercy and loving-kindness. Then, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt pay thy vows.</span> Thou shalt have wealth enough, and strength enough, to pay any vows that thou hast made, which now in thy afflicted state thou canst not do. Vows are part of natural religion, and were widely prevalent over all the East in ancient times. The performance of vows, which was strictly enjoined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>), must at all times have been felt as obligatory by the natural conscience.

Job had complained of the "darkness" by which his path was shadowed (<a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>). Eliphaz promises that this cause of complaint shall be removed. Job's way shall be "made plain before his face." A bright light shall illumine it - a light that shall ever "shine more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>).

He begins by justifying the vehemence of his complaints, first, on the ground of the severity of his sufferings (ver. 2), and secondly, on the ground of his conviction that, if God would bring him to an open trial before his tribunal, he would acquit him (vers. 3-12). By the way, he complains that God hides himself, and cannot be found (vers. 3, 8, 9). He then further complains that God is not to be bent from his purpose, which is set against Job (vers. 13-17). In ch. 24. he goes over ground already trodden, maintaining the general prosperity of the wicked, and their exemption from any special earthly punishment (vers. 2-24). He winds up, finally, with a challenge to his opponents to disprove the truth of what he has said (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Job answered and said, Even to-day is my complaint bitter</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even to-day, notwithstanding all that has been said by my opponents against my right to complain, I do complain, and as bitterly as ever.

God seems to be very far removed from us. He is in heaven, and we are on earth; nay, he is in the highest heaven, or outside it, walking on its circumference (<a href="../../par/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>). How are we to approach near to him, so near as to be sure that he can hear us? How are we to "find" him? So, in all ages, has the human heart gone out to God, aspiring towards him, seeking after him, but, for the most part, baffled and disappointed. Job, like most other men in the olden times, though he has faith in God, though he serves him and prays to him, has yet the feeling that he is remote, distant, well-nigh inaccessible. It needed revelation to let man know that God is not far off, but very near to each one of us; that "in him we live, and move, and have our being" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might come even to his seat!</span> Job's idea of bridging the distance between himself and God is that he should rise to the region where God is, not that God should condescend to come down to him. He wishes to "come to God's seat" - to that awful throne in the heaven of heavens, where God sitteth, surrounded by his hosts of angels, dealing out justice and judgment to mortal men (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>).

Job has put away the feelings of shame and diffidence, which were predominant with him when he said, "How should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>); and again, "How much less shall I answer him, and cheese out my words to reason with him? Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; but I would make my supplication to my Judge" (<a href="../../par/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14, 15</a>). He now wishes to contend and argue and reason. This is quite in accordance with our experience. Many am the moods of man - various and conflicting his desires! His mind never continues long in one stay. <span class="cmt_word">And fill my mouth with arguments</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>, where our translators render the same word by "reproofs," but where "arguments" or "pleadings" would be more appropriate). The LXX. has there <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, and in the present passage <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>.

There, before his high tribunal (ver. 3), the upright man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;</span>) might argue or reason with him, appealing from his justice to his mercy - from God the Judge to God the Saviour (Loathes), vindicating his integrity, acknowledging his transgressions, and pleading that they were sins of infirmity-and at last obtaining from God the acquittal anticipated in the second clause of the verse. In the absence of any revelation of an Advocate who will plead our cause before God for us, Job would seem to have been justified in expecting such a liberty of pleading his own cause as he here sets forth<span class="cmt_word">. So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge</span>. The "Judge of all the earth" will certainly and necessarily "do right." Job's conscience testifies to his substantial integrity and uprightness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). He is, therefore, confident that, if he can once bring his cause to God's cognizance, he will obtain acquittal and deliverance.

He cannot "find" God. God hides himself. It is in vain that he searches on every side. There is no manifestation, no open vision. Nothing, however, leads him to doubt God's existence, or even his presence where he is unperceived. "Job's conviction of God's absolute presence comes out most strongly when he feels that he cannot discern him" (Cook). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there</span>; that is, "He is not there to my <span class="accented">perceptions</span>." I may believe it, but I have no sensible proof of it, and I cannot demonstrate it. <span class="cmt_word">And backward, but I cannot perceive him</span>. In describing locality, the Hebrews, Arabs, and Orientals generally always imagined themselves to be looking eastward, facing the rising sun.

Them were "commandments" which Job recognized as having proceeded from God, and "words" which he looked upon as being the utterances of his mouth. This is strong evidence of a primeval revelation which, if not reduced to writing, had, at any rate, been handed down by tradition to Job's day. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14-19</a> and Genesis 9:1-7 may afford the true explanation of this difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food</span>. This is scarcely strong enough. Job says, "<span class="accented">I have treasured up</span> <span class="accented">taken to myself</span>, <span class="accented">and preserved</span> the words of his mouth," either "more than my necessary food" or "more than my own law." If the former rendering be preferred, there is no need of explanation; if the latter, we must regard "my own law" as meaning "the law of my own mind, my own will, the will of the natural man" (Cook).

The happier tone of thought which extends from ver. 6 to ver. 12 grows out of a sanguine hope on Job's part that God will bring him before his tribunal, and judge his cause according to righteousness. Now he bethinks himself that hitherto God, notwithstanding his prayers, has refused to summon him to his judgment-seat, and begins to fear that there is no likelihood of his changing. "He is One," or "in one." With him is "no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).  How is it likely that he will act in the future otherwise than he has acts! in the past? <span class="cmt_word">What his soul desireth, even that he doeth</span>. A somewhat harsh way of saying that God doeth that which seemeth him best - and which, therefore, is best. Job does not really suppose that God is actuated by caprice or favouritism.

By "times" seem to be meant God's special periods of exhibiting himself in action as the moral Governor of the world, vindicating the righteous, and taking vengeance upon sinners. Such "times" are frequently spoken of in the prophetical Scriptures as "days of the Lord" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>, etc.).

Where neighbouring properties are not divided by fences of any kind, as in the East generally, the only way of distinguishing between one man's land and another's is by termini, or "landmarks," which are generally low stone metes or bourns, placed at intervals on the boundary-line. An easy form of robbery was to displace these bourns, putting them further back on one's neighbour's land. <span class="cmt_word">They violently take away flocks</span>. Others openly drive off their neighbours' flocks from their pastures, mix them with their own flocks, and say that they are theirs (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15-17</a>). <span class="accented">And feed</span> thereof; rather, <span class="accented">and feed them</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> in the margin); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pasture them.

This was another form of oppression. "Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?" says Samuel, on laying down his judgeship (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>). The "fatherless" were particularly liable to such ill treatment, seeing that they had lost their natural protector. <span class="cmt_word">They take the widow's ox for a pledge</span>. It may be true that this was nowhere a legal offence, not even among the Hebrews (Lee); but it was a real act of oppression, and forms a fitting counterpart to the injury done to the orphan. (On the natural tendency of selfish men to bear hard on these two classes, see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>.)

In the East there have always been superior and subject races, as well as proud nobles and down-trodden men of the same race. It is not clear of which of these two Job speaks. The former were often hunted out of all the desirable lands, and forced to fly to rooks and caves and holes in the ground, whence they were known as "Troglodytes." The latter, less frequently, handed together, and withdrew to remote and sequestered spots, where they might hope to live unmolested by their oppressors (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-38.htm">Hebrews 11:38</a>).

First of all, the poor man, whose only wrap or cloak has been taken in pledge, is com-polled to go naked, or almost naked, both day and night, exposed alike to extremes of heat and cold. Secondly, he is compelled to reap and bind and carry home the sheaves of his oppressor, while he himself is half famished with hunger. The second clause of the verse is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, where we read, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; the real meaning being, "and they who are an hungered, carry the sheaves" (compare the Revised Version).

Men's groans are heard also "from the city," and in the midst of the city, where murder, robbery, burglary, adultery, and other crimes of the deepest dye abound.

These city oppressors go beyond the others in entirely rejecting the light of reason, conscience, and law. They threw off every restraint.

He has not the courage to attack the great and powerful, who might be well armed and have retainers to defend them, but enters the houses of a comparatively poor class, in which he is less afraid to risk himself. Here, in the night he is as a thief. He has not come into the house simply for murder. Theft is his main object. He will not take life unless he is resisted or discovered, and so, in a certain sense, driven to it.

There is an analogy between moral and physical light, and between moral and physical darkness. The class of men here spoken of (vers. 14-16), who have rebelled against moral light (ver. 13), and refused its ways, and rejected its paths, are no great lovers of physical light. Their deeds of darkness are only suited to be done in the dark, and they wait for the evening twilight or the dusk of dawn to engage in them (comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>, "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16</a></div><div class="verse">In the dark they dig through houses, <i>which</i> they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the dark they dig through houses</span>. In ancient times, burglary commonly took this form. Windows were few, and high up in the walls; doors were strongly fastened with bolts and bars. But the walls, being of clay, or rubble, or sun-dried brick, were weak and easily penetrable. This was especially the case with party walls; and if burglars entered an unoccupied house, nothing was easier than to break through the slight partition which separated it from the house next door. The Greek word for "burglar" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>" he who digs through a wall." <span class="cmt_word">Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime</span>; rather, they <span class="accented">shut themselves up in the daytime</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they seal themselves up</span>; the meaning being that they carefully keep themselves close.

They hate the morning light. It is associated in their minds with the idea of detection; for when it breaks in upon them unexpectedly in the midst of their ill deeds, detection commonly follows; and detection is a true "shadow of death," for it commonly means the gallows. If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death; rather, <span class="accented">for they know the terrors of the shadow of death</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> the Revised Version).

"Locus obscurissimus" (Schulteus). Scarcely any two commentators agree even as to the subject on which Job proceeds to speak. Some regard him as giving his own judgment on the ultimate fate of the wicked; others, as anticipating what his opponents will say on the point. One recent expositor takes the passage as referring to the efforts made by the malefactors of vers. 14-16 to escape from justice, and to the discredit and difficulty in which they involve themselves. Another suggests that Job here calls attention to a fresh class of oppressors, viz. water-thieves (see Strabo, 16:18), who, starting in light boats from some island in a lake or river, plundered the neighbouring lands, making the portions of the landholders worthless, and causing them to neglect the cultivation, even of their vineyards. If we accept this view, the proper translation of the present verse will be, <span class="accented">Swift is he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the water-thief) <span class="accented">upon the face of the waters</span>: <span class="accented">then is the portion of them who dwell in the land worthless</span>; <span class="accented">no one turneth his face toward his vine. yards</span> (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' pp. 153, 378, 379).

This rendering is further confirmed by the next verse. Accepting it, we must suppose Job to pass at this point to the consideration of the ultimate end of the wicked, though in ver. 21 he returns to the consideration of their ill doings. The heat and drought of summer, he says, consume and dry up all the water which comes from the melting of the winter's snows.

Oppressors of another class are perhaps here spoken of, or perhaps there is a mere return to the idea with which Job's enumeration opened (ver. 3), which was the oppression of the weaker and more defenceless classes.

And doeth not good to the widow</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> neglects to vindicate her cause  - an admitted part of man's duty (see <a href="../../par/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no <i>man</i> is sure of life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He draweth also the mighty with his power</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he draws to his side, and makes his helpers, those who are mighty, attracting them or compelling them to join him by the power which he already has. <span class="cmt_word">He riseth up, and no man is sure of life</span>. This is also the translation of the Revised Version. Some commentators, however, prefer to render, "He riseth up, when he has despaired of life; "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked man, when he has been brought into trouble, either sickness or danger of death at the hands of Justice, to men's surprise, "riseth up" - is delivered from the danger, and recovers his prosperity.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a></div><div class="verse">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all <i>other</i>, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they are exalted</span>: <span class="accented">after a little while they are gone</span> <span class="accented">they are brought low.</span> Job has to admit that death comes upon wicked men at last; but he minimizes the terrors of their death, and exaggerates its alleviations. First, it comes on them when they have risen to eminence, have gained themselves a reputation, and "are exalted." Next, it is sudden and painless, preceded by no long, lingering illness, but just a sinking into non-existence; a tranquil passing away. Thirdly, it is at a ripe age, when they have reached the full term of human life, and are as ears of corn ripe for the harvest. Further, it is the common fate: <span class="cmt_word">They are taken out of the way as all other</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>), and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. We may gather from this expression that the reaping in the land of Uz was conducted in Job's time much in the same way as it was in Egypt under the early Pharaohs, viz. by cutting the stalk with a sharp sickle almost immediately below the ear, and collecting the ears in baskets (see the author's 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162; and his 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 59, 3rd edit.).

Bildad, in his weak reply, entirely avoids the subject, and limits himself to briefly touching two old and well-worn topics - the might of God (vers. 2, 3) and the universal sinfulness of men. On neither of these two points does he throw any fresh light. He avoids, however, the reckless charges of Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>) as well as the coarse menaces of Zophar (<a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, Dominion and fear are with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> with God).

As Bildad seemed to have supposed that he needed enlightenment on these points (<a href="../../par/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), Job may have thought it right to make once more a plain profession of his belief (comp. <a href="../../par/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4-18</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9-25</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dead things are formed from under the waters</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the dead from under the waters tremble.</span> Hehraists generally are agreed that one of the meanings of Rephaim (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) is "the dead" or the departed, considered especially as inhabitants of Hades (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). And if so, this meaning is certainly appropriate here. Blidad had illustrated God's dominion from his power in heaven. Job shows that it exists alike in heaven and earth (vers. 7-13), and in the region under the earth (vers. 5, 6). There, in Sheol, under the waters of the ocean, the dead tremble at the thought of the Most High; they tremble together with other inhabitants thereof, as evil spirits, rebel intelligences, east down to Hades, and there held in durance (<a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>).

God withdraws himself from sight, gathers clouds and darkness around him to be the habitation of his seat, hides from men the principles of his government and administration, makes himself unapproachable and inscrutable, is a mystery and an enigma which man cannot hope to understand or solve (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>).

God restrains within limits alike the "waters that are above the firmament" and those that are beneath it (<a href="../../par/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>). The boundary is placed, somewhat vaguely, "at the confines of light and darkness." <span class="cmt_word">Until the day and night come to an end</span> is a mistranslation.

The "pillars of heaven" are the mountains, on which the sky seems to rest. These "tremble," or seem to tremble, at the presence of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/114-4.htm">Psalm 114:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>) when he visits the earth in storm and tempest, either because the whole atmosphere is full of disturbance, and the outline of the mountains shifts and changes as rain and storm sweep over them, or because the reverberations of the thunder, which shake the air, seem to shake the earth also. <span class="cmt_word">And are astonished at his reproof</span>. To the mind of the poet this "trembling" is expressive of astonishment and consternation. He regards the mountains as hearing the voice of God in the storm, recognizing it as raised in anger, and so trembling and cowering before him.

"Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have "smitten him through <span class="accented">by his understanding</span>" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day. Power alone is sufficient to control the sea.

In the first, which extends to the end of ver. 6, Job is engaged in maintaining, with the utmost possible solemnity (ver. 2), both his actual integrity (ver. 6) and his determination to hold fast his integrity as long as he lives (vers. 4-6). In the second (vers. 7-10) he implicates a curse upon his enemies. In the third (vers. 11-23) he returns to the consideration of God's treatment of the wicked, and retracts the view which he had maintained controversially in <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, with respect to their prosperity, impunity, and equalization with the righteous in death. The retractation is so complete, the concessions are so large, that some have been induced to question whether they can possibly have been made by Job, and have been led on to suggest that we have here a third speech of Zophar's, such as "the symmetry of the general form" requires, which by accident or design has been transferred from him to Job. But the improbability of such a transfer, considering how in the Book of Job the speech of each separate interlocutor is introduced, is palpable; the dissimilarity between the speech and the other utterances of Zophar is striking; and (;he judgment of two such liberal critics as Ewald and Renan, that the passage is rightly placed, and rightly assigned to Job, should set all doubt at rest, and make an end of controversy (see Mr. Froude's 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1 pp. 315, 316; and Canon Cook's "Introduction to the Book of Job," in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span>. The word translated "parable" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;</span>) is only used previously in <a href="../../par/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23</a>, and 24. It is thought to "comprehend all discourses in which the results of discursive thought are concisely or figuratively expressed" (Cook). The introduction of a new term seems to imply that the present discourse occupies a position different from that of all the preceding ones. It is not tentative, controversial, or emotional, but expresses the deliberate judgment of the patriarch on the subjects discussed in it. Note the repetition of the term in <a href="../../par/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> God liveth, <i>who</i> hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, <i>who</i> hath vexed my soul;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As</span> <span class="cmt_word">God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment</span>, Job has not previously introduced any form of adjuration. His "yea has been yea, and his nay nay." Now, however, under the solemn circumstances of the occasion, when he is making his last appeal to his friends for a favourable judgment, he thinks it not inappropriate to preface what he is about to say by an appeal to God as his Witness. "As God liveth," or "As the Lord liveth," was the customary oath of pious Israelites and of God-fearing men generally in the ancient world (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-13.htm">2 Chronicles 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>). Job adds that the God to whom he appeals is he who has "taken away," or "withheld," his judgment, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has declined to enter with him into a controversy as to the justice of his doings (<a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; 13:31; 23:3-7). <span class="cmt_word">And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">made my soul bitter.</span> Though he slays him, yet does Job trust in God (<a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).

Job claims in it to be in possession of all his faculties, notwithstanding his sufferings. The right translation would seem to be, "For my life is yet whole within me" (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit of God is in my nostrils</span>. The spirit of God, originally  breathed into man's nostrils, whereby he became a living soul (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is still, Job says, within him, and makes him capable of judging and declaring what is right.

Not only will Job never cease to maintain his integrity in the past, but he will hold fast to the same course of blameless life in the future. He will not "curse God, and die." Resolutely he will maintain his faith in God, and his dependence on him. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live</span>. This is probably the true meaning, though some suggest "My heart doth not reproach me for any of my days" Job determines to "have always a conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward man" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>).

The nexus of this passage with what goes before is uncertain. Some suppose Job's full thought to have been, "Ye try to persuade me to act wickedly by making a false representation of my feelings and convictions; but I absolutely refuse to do so. Let that rather be the act of my enemy." Others regard him as simply so vexed by his pretended friends, who are his real enemies, that he is driven to utter an imprecation against them. <span class="cmt_word">And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous</span>.

The question reminds us of those words of our blessed <span class="accented">Lord</span> "What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

No; conscious hypocrisy - living a lie - cuts off from God, severs between a man and his Maker, makes all prayers for help vain, until it is repented of and put away from us. The man who dies in it is in a desperate case.

Not only does it alienate God from us, but it nile,ares us from God. The hypocrite cannot "delight in the Almighty." He must shriek from him, tear him, dislike to dwell on the thought of his presence and realize it. His natural inclination must be to withdraw his thoughts from God, and give himself up to the worldliness which has been his attraction to assume the hypocrite's part. <span class="cmt_word">Will he always call upon God?</span> Can be even be depended on not to renounce the service of God altogether? The mutual alienation above spoken of must tend to check communion, to disincline to prayer and calling upon God, to erect a barrier between the hypocrite and the Almighty, which, though for a while it may be insufficient to withstand the force of use and wont, will yet, in the long run, be sure to tell, and will either put an end to prayer altogether, or reduce it to a formality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-11.htm">Job 27:11</a></div><div class="verse">I will teach you by the hand of God: <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> with the Almighty will I not conceal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-23.</span> - It is impossible to deny that this passage directly contradicts Job's former utterances, especially <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>. But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning  of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which "prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will teach you by</span> (or, concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of God</span>. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (<a href="../../par/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. <span class="cmt_word">That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal</span>.

Probably we are to regard Job as led to see, even while he is justifying God's ways with sinners (<a href="../../par/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8-23</a>), how many and how great are the difficulties in the way of forming a single consistent theory of the Divine action, which shall be applicable to all cases. Hence he comes to the conclusion that God is incomprehensible by man and inscrutable; and that it is only given to man to know him sufficiently for his practical guidance. To impress this on his hearers is his main object (vers. 12-28); and, to impress it the more, he introduces it by a sharp contrast. Wonderful as is man's cleverness and ingenuity in respect of earthly things and physical phenomena (vers. 1-11), with respect to heavenly things and the spiritual world - wherewith  true wisdom is concerned - he knows next to nothing. All that he knows is just enough to guide his conduct aright (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely there is a vein for the silver</span>; literally, <span class="accented">an issue for silver? i.e.</span> a place or places whence it is drawn forth from the earth. The silver-mines of Spain were very early worked by the Phoenicians, and produced the metal in great abundance (see the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' p. 314). But Asia itself was probably the source whence silver was obtained in primitive times. And a place for gold where they fine it; or, fuse it. Gold is very widely spread over the earth's surface, and in ancient times was especially abundant in Arabia (Diod. Sic.. 2:1; 3:42; Strabo, 16:4. &sect; 18; Pit,y, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32, etc.); so that Job might easily have been acquainted with the processes of fusing and refining it. Two processes of refining are mentioned by Diodorus as practised by the Egyptians (3:11).

It is scarcely ever found except in the shape of iron ore, and so has to be "taken out of the earth." And brass is molten out of the stone. By "brass" we must understand copper, since the amalgam brass is never found in a natural state. Copper was yielded abundantly in very early times by the mines which the Egyptians worked in the Sinaitic peninsula ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 93, 94). It was also obtainable from Palestine (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), Cyprus ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 311), and Armenia (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>). Sometimes it is found pure, but generally in the shape of copper ore, which has to be "molten" for the pure metal to run off.

Our Revisers translate, <span class="accented">upon the flinty rock</span>; while Canon Cook maintains that "the word used means either granite or quartz." Probably Job meant no more than that man does not shrink from attacking any - even the hardest - rock; but will subdue it, and cut his way through it, if he has occasion so to do. <span class="cmt_word">He overturneth the mountains by the roots</span>. Herodotus, in describing what he had seen of the Phoenician mining operations in the island of Thasos, observes, "a huge, mountain has been turned upside down in the search for ores" (Herod., 6:47). Pliny says of the process employed for detaching huge masses from the metalliferous hills in Spain, "They attack the rock with iron wedges and hammers. When this work is complete, they destroy the supports, and notify by signal that the fall is about to take place. A watchman, stationed on the mountain-top, alone understands the signal; and he proceeds at once to have all the workmen called in, and himself makes a hurried retreat. Then the mountain falls m upon itself with a crash that cannot be imagined, and an incredible concussion of the air. The successful engineers contemplate the ruin which they have achieved" ('Hist.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a></div><div class="verse">He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cutteth out rivers among the rocks</span>. Some understand this of man's general ability to cut canals and tunnels, and change the course of rivers. But the allusion is more probably to the works undertaken in mines for the carrying off of the water from them. Diodorus says that when subterranean springs were tapped in mines, which threatened to flood them, it was usual to construct ducts, or tunnels, by which the inconvenient liquid might be carried off to a lower level (Diod. Siculus, 5:37. &sect; 3). <span class="cmt_word">And his eye seeth every precious thing</span>. Nothing escapes his notice.

This, again, may be either taken generally of man's ability to create dams, dykes, and embankments, whereby the overflow of waters is prevented; or specially of such works when connected with mines, from which it is possible, in some instances, to dam out water that would otherwise interfere with their working. The word translated "overflowing" means probably "weeping," and seems to point to that leakage from the roofs and sides of galleries and adits which is more difficult to control and stop than even subterranean springs or rivers. And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. This is the final result of mining operations. Things useful or beautiful that are hiddden deep down in the heart of the earth, and that might have seemed wholly inaccessible, are brought out of the pit's month into the light of day for the service and delectation of mankind.

"Where," he asks, "is this to be found?" It is a wholly different thing from cleverness and ingenuity. It inquires into causes and origins, into the ends and purposes of things; it seeks to solve the riddle of the universe. Perfect wisdom can, of course, only dwell with God (ver. 23). Man must be content with something much below this. With him "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding" (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But where shall wisdom be found?</span> "Wisdom is the principal thing," says Solomon (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>); and again, "It is better to get wisdom than gold" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>). But where is it to be found? Job's three friends thought that it dwelt with them (<a href="../../par/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>); but this was a mistake, since God reproaches them with their "folly" (<a href="../../par/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>). Job does not claim to possess it (<a href="../../par/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>); he only desires it. It is his deep conviction that it is only possessed, in the true sense of the word, by God. <span class="cmt_word">And where is the place of understanding?</span> It is not quite clear whether Job intends to make any distinction between "wisdom" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>) and "understanding" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>). Canon Cook suggests that "wisdom" is "the reason which deals with principles," and "understanding" "the faculty which discerns and appreciates their application." But refined distinctions of this kind are scarcely suitable to the age of Job. Dean Plumptre, in his comment on Proverbs ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 529), accepts the distinction implied in the Septuagint translation of that book, which renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>' and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This is a much simpler and more easily understood distinction, being that which separates between scientific know. ledge and the practical intelligence which directs conduct. But it may be doubted  whether Job does not use the two words as synonyms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a></div><div class="verse">Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man knoweth not the price thereof</span>. The real value of wisdom cannot be estimated in terms of ordinary human calculation. It transcends figures. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is it found in the land of the living</span>. True wisdom, such as Job is speaking of (see the comment on vers. 12-28), does not exist among men. It transcends human faculties, and is among the peculiar possessions of the Most High (ver. 23). Hence the Most High is altogether inscrutable by man" his ways are past finding out."

No amount of gold can purchase it; no, not of the purest and most refined quality</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20, 21</a>), for it is not a thing that can be bought or sold God must grant it, and find a way of imparting it; which he certainly will not do for a sum of money. Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof; If gold cannot purchase it, much less can silver - the less valuable medium of exchange. (On the <span class="accented">weighing</span> of silver, in sales, see <a href="../../par/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-26.htm">Ezra 8:26</a>.)

The locality of Ophir has been much contested, but, on the whole, the weight of evidence would seem to be in favour of Arabia, on the south-east coast (see the article on "Ophir" in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' which exhausts all that can be said on the subject). The high estimation in which "gold of Ophir" was held appears not only in this passage, but also in <a href="../../par/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>: and <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It is to be accounted for by the imperfection of all the anciently known processes of refining, which left the best refined gold inferior to the natural product of the Ophir mines or washings. <span class="cmt_word">With the precious onyx, or the sapphire</span>. (On the latter of these two stones, see the comment upon ver. 6.) The "onyx" is probably the stone now known as the "sardonyx," which was highly prized by the ancients. It had a place in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and is mentioned among the treasures of the King of Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The sardonyx presents layers variously coloured, as blue, black, white, and vermilion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/28-17.htm">Job 28:17</a></div><div class="verse">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it <i>shall not be for</i> jewels of fine gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">gold and crystal.</span> This second mention of gold (see ver. ]5) seems superfluous, but perhaps the patriarch is thinking of some goblet or ornament in which crystal and gold were combined together. Ornaments of this kind bare been found in Phoenicia ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' pp. 362, 370). <span class="cmt_word">And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold</span>; or, <span class="accented">vessels of fine gold.</span> Both in Egypt and Phoenicia vessels of gold were common.

The word translated "coral" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) means properly "things that are high." It occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>. The rabbinical interpretation of the word as "coral" is doubtful, since it was unknown to the LXX. Or of pearls. The word <span class="accented">gabish</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) occurs only in this place. Some identify it with rock-crystal. <span class="cmt_word">For the price of wisdom is above rubies</span>. Here we have another obscure word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which is variously rendered by "rubies," "pearls," "carbuncles," and "red coral." The balance of authority is in favour of pearls.

In favour of its being the chrysolite is the passage of Pliny which mentions its being esteemed for its <span class="accented">green</span> tints ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:8). Otherwise "topaz" might have appeared to be the best rendering. By "Cush," here translated "Ethiopia," is probably meant Cushite Arabia, or the southern and south-eastern regions (see the author's 'Origin of Nations,' pp. 206-209). Neither shall it be valued with pare gold. Of the four words used for "gold" in this passage (vers. 15-17), one (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;</span>) seems to be the common name, and to designate the metal by its coleus, "yellow," since <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> means "to be yellow" Another (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly "what is treasured," or "shut up," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shut." The third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>) seems to be the name for "native gold," or that found in river-washings and nuggets, which was regarded as the purest. The fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) is a poetical name only, and designates gold of extreme purity (<a href="../../par/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a>), whether highly refined or native. Job uses them all, to show that there was no gold of any kind wherewith it was possible to purchase wisdom.

This is a repetition of ver. 12, with a mere variant of the verb in the first line. Job's elaborate inquiry of vers. 14-19 having thresh no light on the subject, the original question recurs - Where does wisdom come from? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/28-21.htm">Job 28:21</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living</span>. Man cannot see it, because it is immaterial, but he cannot even  conconceive of it, because its nature transcends him. <span class="cmt_word">And kept close from the fowls of the air.</span> (comp. ver. 7).

"Death and destruction" seem to represent the inhabitants of Sheol - the world of the departed. Job personifies them, and represents them as saying, that in their gloomy and remote abode (<a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>) they have heard some dim rumour, some vague report, of the "place" of wisdom and understanding, the nature of which, however, they do not communicate to him. His idea seems to be that their knowledge on the subject does not much transcend the knowledge of living men, whom he regards as profoundly ignorant with respect to it. He thus prepares the way for his assertion in the next verse. Man, neither living nor dead, can make any answer to the great question raised; but - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/28-23.htm">Job 28:23</a></div><div class="verse">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof</span>. God only understands what true wisdom is. It is a part of his being, an essential element of his nature. He knows "the way" of it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> how it works and manifests itself; and he knows "the place' of it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> where it dwells, what limits it has, if any, and how far it is communicable to any beside himself. The highest knowledge is all hid in God (<a href="../../par/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2-3</a>); and, except so far as God imparts it to him, man can know nothing of it.

Man is conditioned. God is unconditioned. Man's knowledge has strict and narrow limits. God "looketh unto the <span class="accented">ends of the earth."</span> It is the universality of God's knowledge that makes each item of it perfect. Where knowledge is circumscribed, it is impossible to be sure that some truth outside the circle of the person's cognizance has not a bearing on that which is within his cognizance - a bearing, which, if he were aware of it, would give the truth a different aspect. With God alone there are no such limits, everything being within his cognizance. <span class="cmt_word">And seeth under the whole heaven</span>. As his knowledge of earthly things is unlimited, so is his knowledge of heavenly things also; and not only of heavenly things in a material sense, as of sun, moon, stars, comets, planets, nebulae, etc., but also of causes, principles, ends, laws, and the like, whereby both material and immaterial things are governed, ordered, and maintained in being. Of matters of this kind and character man can only say, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; I cannot attain unto it" (<a href="../../par/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>).

God "made a decree for the rain" when be placed the fall of rain under fixed and unalterable laws. In some countries rainy seasons begin almost regularly on a fixed day in the calendar, while for several months in the year it is almost certain that rain will not fall. Even where there is no such exact regularity as this, the rainfall has its laws, since there are maxima and minima which are never exceeded. <span class="cmt_word">And a way for the lightning of the thunder</span>. God gave laws to the electric current, and prescribed the "way" that it should take in its passage from heaven to earth, or from cloud to cloud, or from earth to heaven.

From the creation of the world, and before it, God foresaw all that was necessary to maintain his universe in the perfect order and the perfect beauty that he designed for it. At the Creation he, in a certain sense, "declared it," or set it forth, before such intelligences as then existed. Subsequently, in part to Adam, in part to Noah, in part to Moses, he further declared, by revelation, at any rate a portion of the design of his creation, and of the laws by which it was regulated. <span class="cmt_word">He prepared it, yea, and searched it out</span>. This is an inversion of what seems to us the natural order, whereof there are many examples. God must first have investigated and searched out, in his own secret counsels, the entire scheme of creation, and afterwards have proceeded to the "preparation" or "establishment" of it.

The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 27:1).

It would be "over against" the city, separated from it by a large square or place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>), in which a multitude might assemble (sue <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>). Hither Job was accustomed to proceed  from time to time, to act as judge and administrator. When I prepared my seat in the street. On such occasions a seat would be brought out and "prepared," where the judge would sit to hear causes and deliver sentences (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>).

Compare the respect paid to age by the Spartans. And the aged arose, and stood up. Here the respect paid was not to age so much as to dignity. Men as old as himself, or older, paid Job the compliment of standing up until he was seated, in consideration of his rank and high office.

The other head-men of the tribe, recognizing Job's superior rank and dignity, refrained from words as soon as he made his appearance, and in silence awaited what he would say. Perhaps we are scarcely to understand literally the further statement that they laid their hand on their mouth, which is probably as much an idiom as our phrase, "they held their tongues "(comp. <a href="../../par/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>).

Job, having described his reception by the nobles and chief men of the city, proceeds to speak of the behaviour of the common people. The former were respectful and attent, the latter rejoiced and made acclamation. Being of the class most exposed to oppression and wrong, they hailed in the patriarch a champion and a protector. They were sure of redress and justice where he was the judge. <span class="cmt_word">And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me</span>.

Oppression in the East sometimes drives its victims to actual starvation or to suicide. Isaiah calls the oppressors against whom he inveighs "murderers" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>). These "perishing" ones Job often saved, and they "blessed" him. <span class="cmt_word">And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy</span>. How cold are the words of Ameni, "No widow have I oppressed," compared with these! Job was not content with mere abstinence from evil, mere negative virtue. He so actively and effectually relieved distress that affliction was turned into happiness, and lamentation into rejoicing.

Job "put on righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made it as the garment wherewith he clothed himself withal (<a href="../../par/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18, 19</a>), covered up with it all his own natural imperfections, and made it part and parcel of his being. It was a beautiful covering, and, when once he had put it on, it clung to him, and could not be removed. It "clothed him," or rather, if we translate the Hebrew literally, "clothed itself with him." putting him on, as he had put it on. It was not merely external; it was internal, a habit of his soul and spirit. <span class="cmt_word">My judgment was as a robe and a diadem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my justice</span> (see the Revised Version).

The Persian kings had officials, whom they called their "eyes" and their "ears" - observers who were to inform them of all that went on in the provinces ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 213). Job acted as "eyes" to the blind of his time, giving them the information which their infirmity hindered them from obtaining. He was also feet to the lame, taking  messages for them, going on their errands, and the like. He was kind and helpful to his fellow-men, not only in great, but also in little matters.

Job compares himself, in his former prosperous state, to a tree growing by a river-side, which receives a double nourishment - from the actual water of the stream, which reaches its roots, and from the moisture evaporated from the stream, which hangs in the air, and descends in the shape of dew upon its leaves and branches.

My strength did not fail. When it seemed on the point of failing, it was secretly and mysteriously "renewed." Some commentators regard vers. 19 and 20 as a portion of the speech begun in ver. 18, and view the verbs, not as past tenses, but as futures (compare the translation of the Revised Version).

The rest of the verse is additional, having reference to the conduct of Job under his earlier trials (<a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20-22</a>). And still he holdeth fast his integrity. This has been justly called "the key-note of the whole book" (Cook). Satan had declared that Job's integrity rested on no solid basis, and would easily be overthrown and disappear. God, confident in his servant's faithfulness and truth, had allowed him to assail it. What was the result? God declares it with his own mouth. Job's "integrity" had not been wrested from him; he still maintained it (<a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21, 22</a>), as he was about to do till the end (<a href="../../par/job/42-1.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>).

No doubt a proverbial expression, resembling "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth; Tit for tat," and the like; but not expressive of retaliation. Satan means that, to keep his own "skin" intact, a man will sacrifice another's "skin;" even that of his nearest and dearest. Job, he insinuates, submitted to the loss of his children without a murmur, because he feared that otherwise God would stretch forth his hand against his person, and smite it or destroy it. He cannot imagine any motive for submission and apparent resignation but a selfish one (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9</a><span class="cmt_word">). Yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a man will submit to the loss, not only of all his possessions, but even of those whom he loves best, to save his own life - he will do anything for that."

Again it is strongly marked that Satan's power is under God's control, and extends only so far as God shows. <span class="cmt_word">But save his life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">only spare his life</span> (Revised Version). The didactic purposes for which God was allowing his faithful servant to be tried in the furnace of affliction would have been frustrated by Job's removal from the earth. Individually he might equally well have been compensated in another world; but then the lesson of his example to living men, and the lesson of his story to all future generations of mankind, would have been lost. Besides, God but rarely, in the old world, gave a faithful servant, still in the full vigour of life (<a href="../../par/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16, 17</a>), "over unto death" (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>).

"The surface of the integuments," says Dr. Quain, "is often much inflamed, and sometimes discharges a serous ichor, or chyle-like fluid, according to the extent to which the lymphatics are engaged in the particular ease" (ibid., p. 432). This "serous or lymph-like fluid" is occasionally "acrid and offensive." Job seems to have used his potsherd to scrape it away<span class="cmt_word">. And he sat down among the ashes.</span> Not as a curative process, or even as an alleviation of his pains, but simply as was the custom of mourners (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>).

Now she can endure no longer. To see her husband so afflicted, and so patient under his afflictions, is more than she can bear. Her mind is weak and ill regulated, and she suffers herself to become Satan's ally and her husband's worst enemy. It is noticeable that she urges her husband to do exactly that which Satan had suggested that he would do (<a href="../../par/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>), and had evidently wished him to do, thus fighting on his side, and increasing her husband's difficulties The only other mention of her (<a href="../../par/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>) implies that she was rather a hindrance than a help to Job. <span class="cmt_word">Curse God, and die</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "renounce God, put all regard for him away from thee, even though he kill thee for so doing."

He accepts both prosperity and affliction as coming from God, and expresses himself as willing to submit to his will. But he has, perhaps, scarcely attained to the conviction that whatever God sends to his faithful servants is always that which is best for them - that afflictions, in fact, are blessings in disguise, and ought to be received with gratitude, not with murmuring (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a><span class="cmt_word">).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him</span>. It is not to be supposed that Job had no more than three friends - indeed, Elihu the Buzzite appears later on as one of his friends (<a href="../../par/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2-6</a>) - but he had three contemporaries with whom he was especially intimate, old men (<a href="../../par/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>), with whom he was probably accustomed to confer from time to time, and who were in the habit of giving him their advice. All three, apparently, lived at a distance; and it seems to have been some weeks before the news of his misfortunes reached them. When the news came they held communication one with another, and agreed to pay him visits of condolence at a certain definite time, which was determined upon between them. Some months - at least two - seem to have elapsed between the date of Job's latest affliction and the time of their arrival  (<a href="../../par/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They came every one from his own place</span>. They had separate homes, and probably lived at some considerable distance from one another. Eliphaz the Temanite. There was an Eliphaz, the son of Esau by his wife Adah, who had a son Teman (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-4.htm">Genesis 36:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-35.htm">1 Chronicles 1:35, 36</a>); but it is not supposed that this can be the person here intended. The name Teman did not become geographical until the descendants of this Eliphaz's son had multiplied into a tribe, when they gave name to the portion of Arabia which they inhabited. This tract seems to have been either a part of Edom, or in its immediate vicinity (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-42.htm">Genesis 36:42, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8, 9</a>), but cannot be located with accuracy. The Temanitee were celebrated for their wisdom, as we learn from Jeremiah, who says (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>), "Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?" Job's friend was probably among their wisest men at the time; and his discourses certainly show a considerable knowledge of human nature. They do not, however, solve the riddle of the universe. <span class="cmt_word">And Bildad the Shuhite</span>. Bildad is a name which does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, neither is there any other mention of Shuhites. Conjecture has identified the Shuhites with the Saccaei of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:15), whom he places in the neighbourhood of Batanaea and Trachonitis. But the Saccaei are unheard of till Ptolemy's time, and seem to be a tribe of very small importance. Perhaps Bildad belonged to the people known to the Assyrians as the Tsukhi, or Sukhi ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 14), who dwelt on the Middle Euphrates from about Anah to Hit ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 66, 67). <span class="cmt_word">And Zophar the Naamathite</span>. Zophar, or rather Tsophar, is another unknown name. There was a Naamah, a city, in south-western Judaea (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>), to which Zophar may have belonged, though probably a region, rather than a city, is here intended. <span class="cmt_word">For they had made an appointment together</span>; or, <span class="accented">agreed together</span>, by message or letter probably. <span class="cmt_word">To come to mourn with him and to comfort him</span>. A good intention, at any rate, and one agreeable to the apostolic injunction to us to "weep with them that weep" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). That they failed to carry out their intention (<a href="../../par/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>) was owing to a want of judgment, and, perhaps, in part, to a want of love.

Professor Lee supposes that this is not to be taken literally. "It means" he says, "that they sat with him a considerable length of time before they opened the question discussed in this book, not that they sat precisely seven days and seven nights, and said not so much as one word to him" ('The Book of the Patriarch Job; p. 194). But the period of" seven days" was appropriate to mournings (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a> 2Samuel 31:13 <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>), and if they could stay with him one day and one night without speaking, why not seven? Food would be brought them, and they might sleep rolled up in their <span class="accented">begeds</span>. The long silence may be accounted for by the fact that "among the Jews," and among Orientals generally, "it is a point of decorum, and one dictated by a fine and true feeling, not to speak to a person in deep affliction until he gives an intimation of a desire to be comforted" (Cook). So long as Job kept silence they had to keep silence, at least so far as he was concerned. They might speak to any attendants who drew near, and they might speak one to another. Note the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And none spake a word unto him</span> None spake <span class="accented">to him</span>; but no etiquette imposed complete silence on them. <span class="cmt_word">For they saw that his grief was very great</span>.

Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31).

As Job had been speaking last of the honour in which he was once held, he beans his contrast by chewing how at present he is disgraced and derided. Men who are outcasts and solitary themselves, poor dwellers in caves (ver. 6), who have much ado to keep body and soul together (vers. 3, 4), and not men <span class="accented">only</span> but youths, mere boys, scoff at him, make him a song and a byword (ver. 9). nay, "spare not to spit in his face" (ver. 10). There seem to have been in his vicinity weak and debased tribes, generally contemned and looked down upon, regarded as thieves (ver. 5) by their neighbours, and considered to be of base and vile origin (ver. 8), who saw in Job's calamities a rare opportunity for insulting and triumphing over a member of the superior race which had crushed them, and thus tasting, to a certain extent, the sweetness of revenge. <span class="cmt_word">Whose fathers I would have disdained</span> (rather, I <span class="accented">disdained</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to have set with the dogs of my flock</span>.

Weak races retreat before strong ones, who occupy their lands, and whose will they do not dare to dispute. They are not intentionally "driven out," for the strong raecs would gladly make them their drudges; but they retire into the most inaccessible regions, as the primitive population has done in India and elsewhere. They cried after them as after a thief. Outcast tribes naturally, and almost necessarily, become robber-tribes. Deprived of their productive lands, and driven into rocky deserts, want makes them thieves and marauders. Then those who have made them what they are vilify and decry them.

The tract about Petra is, perhaps, the most remarkable of these regions; but there are many others which closely resemble it. These places afford refuges to weak and outcast tribes, who hide in them, either in caves of the earth, or in the rocks. The Greeks called these unfortunates "Troglodytes"(Herod., 4:183; Strabo, 16. p. 1102; Diod. Sic., 3:14.etc.), the Hebrews "Horim," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> "a hole."

"Terrors' take hold upon him. He experiences in his sleep horrible dreams and visions (see <a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>), and even in his waking hours he is haunted by fears. The "terrors of God do set themselves in array against him" (<a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>).

The bitterest cry upon the cross was "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" But no good man is ever really God-forsaken, and no rightful and earnest prayers are ever really unheard. Job "had need of patience" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>), patient as he was (<a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).

Job has all along expressed his conviction that he has nothing to look for but death. He feels within himself the seeds of a mortal malady; for such, practically, was elephantiasis in Job's time. He  is devoid of any expectation of recovery. Death must come upon him, he thinks, ere long; and then God will bring him to the house appointed for all living. This, as he has already explained (<a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>), is "the land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness." It is a melancholy prospect; but we must regard it as cheered by the hope of an ultimate resurrection, such as seems indicated, if not absolutely proclaimed, in <a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a> (see the comment on that passage).

This is one of the most obscure passages in the entire Book of Job, and scarcely any two independent commentators understand it alike. To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader. It will, per-Imps, suffice to select the one which to the present writer appears the most satisfactory. This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: "Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity." The same writer further explains the passage as follows: "I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit."

Job was "looking for good," expecting fully the continuance of his great wealth and prosperity, when the sudden shock of calamity fell upon him It was wholly unexpected, and therefore the harder to bear. And when I waited for light, there came darkness. This may refer to periods, after his calamities began, when he had hopes that his prayers would be answered, and a rest or pause, an interval of repose, be granted him (<a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>), but when his hopes were disappointed, and the darkness closed in upon him thicker and murkier than ever.

Eliphaz had taxed him generally  with harshness and cruelty in his relations towards those weaker than himself (<a href="../../par/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>), but had not specially pointed to this kind of oppressiveness. As, however, this was the commonest form of the vice, Job deems it right to disclaim it, before addressing himself to the several charges brought by Eliphaz. He has <span class="accented">not</span> ill used his slaves, either male or female. He has not "despised their cause," but given it full consideration and attention; he has heard them when they contended with him; he has allowed them to "contend;" he has been a just, and not a hard master. The slavery of which he speaks is evidently of a kind under which the slave had certain rights, as was the case also under the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-11</a>).

The duty of relieving the poor, solemnly enjoined upon the people of Israel in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), was generally admitted by the civilized nations of antiquity. In Egypt it was especially insisted on. "The Egyptian's duties to mankind," says Dr. Birch, "were comprised in giving bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, oil to the wounded, and burial to the dead" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 46). <span class="cmt_word">Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail</span>.

The widow's weakness has always been felt to give her a special claim on man's benevolence (see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).

Job feels that it is wrong even to care greatly for wealth. He seems almost to anticipate the saying of St. Paul, that "covetousness is idolatry" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>); and hence he passes on without pause from this sort of creature-worship to others common in his day (vers. 26, 27). which he likewise disclaims.

Sun-worship, the least ignoble form of idolatry, was widely spread in the East, and in Egypt, from a very early date. According to the views of some, the religion el' t e Egyptians was little else than a complicated sun-worship from its earliest inception to its very latest phase. "The religious notions of the Egyptians," says Dr. Birch, "were chiefly connected with the worship of the sun, with whom at a later period all the principal deities were connected. As Hag, or Harmachis, he represented the youthful or rising sun; as Ra, the midday; and as Turn. the setting sun. According to Egyptian notions, that god floated in a boat through the sky or celestial ether, and descended to the dark regions of night, or Hades. Many deities attended on his passage or were connected with his worship, and the gods Amen and Khepr, who represented the invisible and self-produced god, were identified with the sun" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' Introduction, pp. 9, 10.). Even those who do not go these lengths admit that the solar worship was, at any rate, a very main element in the cult of Egypt (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 342-364). In the Babylonian and Assyrian religion the position of the sun-god was leas prominent, but still, as San, or Shamas, he held an important place, and was the main object of religious veneration to a largo body of worshippers ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 126-128; vol. 2. pp. 17, 18). In the Vedic system the sun figured as Mitra, and in the Zoroastrian as Mithra, in both holding a high position. Among the Arabians the sun, worshipped as Orotal, is said to have been anciently the only god, though he was accompanied by a female principle named Alilat (Herod., 3:8). <span class="cmt_word">Or the moon walking in brightness</span>. The worship of the moon has. in most countries where it has prevailed, been quite secondary and subordinate to that of the sun. In Egypt. while nine gods are more or less identified with the solar luminary, two only, Khons and Thoth, can be said to represent the moon. In the Vedic and Zoroastrian systems the moon, called Soma, or Hems, almost dropped out of the popular religion, at any rate as a moon-god. In the Arabiun, Alilat, a goddess, probably represented the moon, as did Ashtoreth, a goddess, in the Pheonician. In Assyria, however, and in Babylonia, moon-worship held a higher position, Sin, the moon-god, taking precedence over Shamas, the sun-god, and being a very much more important personage (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 123-126; vol. 2. pp. 16, 17). Thus both moon-worship and sun-worship were prevalent among all, or almost all, Job's neighbours.

The sin of the heart is placed first, as the <span class="accented">fens et origo mali</span> the spiritual root of the matter. On this naturally follows the outward act which, in the case of idolatry, was commonly the act exactly expressed by the word "adore" - the movement of the hand to the mouth in token of reverence and honour (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 28:2, "Inter adorandum <span class="accented">dexteram ad osculum referimus</span>, et totum corpus circumagimus;" and Minucius Felix, Octav., 2, Caecilius, simulacro Serapidis denotato, ut vulgus superstitiosum solet, <span class="accented">manum ori admovens</span> osculum labiis pressit").

It is rightly concluded from this expression that, in the country and age of Job, the sort of idolatry which is here mentioned was practised by some, and also that it was legally punishable. <span class="cmt_word">For I should have denied the God that is above</span>. The worship of any other god besides the supreme God is, practically, atheism, since "no man can serve two  masters." Moreover, to set up two independent gods is to destroy the idea of God, which implies supremacy over every other being.

The religious traditions of the Chaldees, which note the war in heaven, the Deluge, the building of the Tower of Babel, and the confusion of tongues, contain no mention of Adam or of Paradise. Nor. so far as I am aware, is there, among other ancient legends, any near parallel to the story of the Fall as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>.

It is found among the ancestors of Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), among the Korhite Levites of the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>), and as a variant for Eliab, one of David's brothers (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-8.htm">1 Chronicles 27:8</a>) The meaning of the word was, "He is my God" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Barachal</span>. Barachel is also a significant name. It means, "Bless, O God," or "God blesses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. <span class="cmt_word">The Buzite</span>. "Huz" and "Buz" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of Ram.</span> By "Ram" we are probably to understand "Aram," who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz. (On the connection of Huz and Buz with the Arabian tribes of Khazu and Bazu, see the comment on Job 1:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God</span>. Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions. Job had himself apologized for them (<a href="../../par/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a>); and certainly they went perilously near taxing God with injustice (see <a href="../../par/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>). But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his "comforters." "My wrath is kindled," he says to Eliphaz, "against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <span class="accented">the thing that is right</span> <span class="accented">as my servant Job</span> hath" (<a href="../../par/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-3.htm">Job 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and <i>yet</i> had condemned Job.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer</span>. Elihu thought that Job's reasonings and complaints admitted of being satisfactorily answered, and was vexed that the three "friends" had not made the right replied It is the main object of his speech to supply them. And yet had condemned Job. They had condemned him on wrong grounds and of sins that he had not committed (<a href="../../par/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6-9</a>). Elihu condemns him as much (<a href="../../par/job/33-9.htm">Job 33:9-12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7-9</a>, etc.), but for entirely different reasons.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <i>am</i> young, and ye <i>are</i> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-22.</span> - The speech of Elihu now begins. In the present chapter, after a short apologetic exordium, excusing his youth (vers. 6-9), he addresses himself exclusively to Job's friends. He has listened attentively to them, and weighed their words (vers. 11, 12). but has found nothing in them that confuted Job. They had not "found wisdom" - they had not "vanquished Job" - at the last they had been "amazed, and had not had a word more to say" (vers. 13-16). Elihu, therefore, will supply their deficiency; he has kept silence with difficulty, and is full of thoughts, to which he would fain give utterance (vers. 17-20). In all that he says he will show no favouritism - he will "accept no man's-person," "give no flattering titles," but express sincerely what he believes (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old</span>. We can only guess at the exact ages of Job and his friends. From the fact that God at the last "gave Job twice as much as he had before" (<a href="../../par/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), and the further fact that he lived, after he had recovered his prosperity, a hundred and forty years (<a href="../../par/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>), it has been conjectured that he was seventy years of age at the time of his conference with his friends, and that he died at the age of two hundred and ten. But this clearly is quite uncertain. He may not have been much more than fifty when his calamities fell upon him. If this were so, the age of his friends need not have exceeded from sixty to seventy. Perhaps Elihu was himself not more than thirty. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I held back and was afraid to utter what I knew in your pre</span>sence. Elihu would have been thought unduly pushing and presumptuous if he had ventured to come forward until his seniors had ended their colloquy.

Age should give wisdom, and the speech of the old should be most worthy of being attended to. Elihu had been brought up in this conviction, and therefore refrained himself. <span class="cmt_word">And multitude of years should teach wisdom</span>. "Old experience should attain to something of prophetic strain." "One ought to give attention," says Aristotle, "to the mere unproved assertions of wise and aged men, as much as to the actual demonstrations of others" ('Eth.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>there is</i> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there is a spirit in man</span>. But, after all, it is not mere age and experience that make men wise and able to teach others. "There is a spirit in man" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>); and it is according as this spirit is or is not enlightened from on high that men speak words of wisdom or the contrary. <span class="cmt_word">The inspiration of the Almighty</span> - this it is, which - <span class="cmt_word">giveth them understanding</span>. And such inspiration it is in the power of God to bestow, as he pleases, on the old or on the young, on the great of the earth, or on those of small reputation. Hence Elihu's conclusion - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-9.htm">Job 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">Great men are not <i>always</i> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged</span> (always) <span class="cmt_word">understand judgment</span>. Elihu lays down the universal law, before applying it to the particular instance. True wisdom is from God, not from observation and experience. Therefore many aged men are not wise; many experienced men, great in position, versed in affairs, do not possess understanding. It is a trite remark, "With how little wisdom the world is governed!" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-10.htm">Job 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I said, Hearken to me</span>. Elihu evidently claims, not exactly what is ordinarily understood by inspiration, but that his spirit, is divinely enlightened, and that therefore he is more competent to take part in the controversy that has been raised than many of the aged. <span class="cmt_word">I also will show mine opinion</span>. "I also," or "even I" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I, young as I am, "will show my opinion," or "utter what I know on the subject." Elihu does not speak of his convictions as mere "opinions," but claims to be in possession of actual "knowledge." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-11.htm">Job 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I waited for your words</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I was full of expectation; I waited impatiently to hear what you would say."

Professor Lee translates, "whilst ye examined <span class="accented">Job's c</span>onclusions; but the Authorized Version is probably correct. Elihu means that he listened carefully while the friends hunted out all the arguments they could think of in order to confute Job.

In Elihu's opinion, the argumentative value of all the long  speeches of the three friends was <span class="accented">nil</span>; they had entirely failed to answer Job's arguments.

"Do not suppose, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that you have triumphed in the controversy, that your mode of meeting Job's complaints is the wise and right one. The exact reverse is the case. You have not vanquished Job. On the contrary, he is unvanquished, and remains master of the field. If he is ever to be vanquished, it will not be by you. <span class="cmt_word">God thrusteth</span> (rather, <span class="accented">may thrust</span>) him down, <span class="cmt_word">not man</span>. A true prophecy! (see <a href="../../par/job/40-1.htm">Job 40:1-14</a>).

Elihu thinks that he can interfere in the controversy with the better prospect of a good result, since he is untouched by any of Job's words, and can therefore speak without passion or resentment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I answer him with your speeches</span>. He is also going to bring forward fresh arguments, which, as they avoid the line taken by the three friends, may soothe, instead of exasperating, the patriarch.

Neither courtesy nor etiquette prescribes it. <span class="cmt_word">Especially when I have waited so long, and have so much to say, and am so exceedingly anxious to say it</span> (see vers. 18-20). Elihu shows all the impatience and ardour of a young speaker (see ver. 6), and feels the confidence that young men so often feel in the wisdom and persuasiveness of their words (comp. <a href="../../par/job/33-1.htm">Job 33:1-6</a>).

The initial "I said" is superfluous. Elihu, having asked himself the question, "Shall I wait?" in ver. 16, here gives the answer. He will not wait any longer, he will take the word, he will set forth his conviction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/32-18.htm">Job 32:18</a></div><div class="verse">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am full of matter</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am full</span> of words; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have very much to say. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit within me constraineth me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the spirit of my belly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my inward feelings and emotions." Compare Zophar's statements in <a href="../../par/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2, 3</a>; and Job's own declarations in ch. 13, that he <span class="accented">must</span> speak (vers. 13, 19). There is a state of internal excitement, when reticence becomes impossible.

The process of fermentation properly takes place in the vat, from which the gas evolved in the operation can freely escape. When wine was put into skins before fermentation was complete, and gas continued to be evolved, the effect was that the skins became distended, as the gas had no vent, and then not unfrequently the skins would burst, especially if they were old ones (see <a href="../../par/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is ready to burst like new bottles</span>. Even if the skins were new, they would undergo distension, and would appear as if "ready to burst," though the actual catastrophe might be avoided. Elihu's pent-up feelings seem to him, if they do not obtain a vent, to threaten some such a result.

Elihu feels almost suffocated by conflicting feelings of rage (vers. 1-3), disappointment (vers. 11, 12), and anxiety to vindicate God's honour (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I will open my lips and answer</span>. In the remainder of Elihu's discourse the attempt is made to "answer" Job (see ch. 33-37), with what success will be considered elsewhere.

Elihu hopes that, in what he is about to say, he will not permit himself to be swayed by any personal bias; that he will neither unduly favour the upper classes nor the vulgar (see Professor Lee, on the difference between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> 'Book of Job,' p. 444), but will treat all fairly and equitably. <span class="cmt_word">Neither let me</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">give flattering titles unto man</span>. Professor Lee observes on this: "The Oriental practice of giving long and fulsome titles is too well known to need anything beyond the mere mention of the fact." Elihu certainly, in the whole of his address, flatters no one.

Elihu claims to be quickened and informed by the Divine Spirit which was once breathed into man (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), whereby man became a living soul (comp. <a href="../../par/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life</span>; or, <span class="accented">quiekened me - originated</span> and preserved my life.

Job, he says, asserts his absolute innocence (ver. 9); he also maintains that God deals with him harshly, as an enemy (vers. 10, 11). Neither assertion is justifiable. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying</span>. Elihu does not quote exactly what Job had said. He probably intended to be perfectly fair and just, but in reality he greatly overstates the truth. Job had never said the words he ascribes to him in ver. 9; at best they are an inference, or deduction, from what he had said. And he had said a great deal on the other side, which Elihu overlooks (see the comment on ver. 9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-9.htm">Job 33:9</a></div><div class="verse">I am clean without transgression, I <i>am</i> innocent; neither <i>is there</i> iniquity in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent</span>. Job had not said that he was "clean," or "without transgression," or "innocent." With respect to "cleanness," he had observed, "Who can bring a <span class="accented">clean</span> thing out of an <span class="accented">unclean?</span> not one," implying that all men were unclean (see <a href="../../par/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>). Concerning ,'transgressions," he had declared, "I have sinned... Why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?" (<a href="../../par/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20, 21</a>); and again, "Thou makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth" (<a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>). Further, he had asked to be told the number of his iniquities and sins (<a href="../../par/job/13-23.htm">Job 13:23</a>), and declared that God kept his transgressions and iniquities sewn up and sealed in a bag (<a href="../../par/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>). With regard to "innocence," the only observation that he had made was, "I know that thou wilt <span class="accented">not</span> hold me innocent" (<a href="../../par/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>). What he had really asserted was his uprightness, his integrity, his "righteousness" (<a href="../../par/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>: 16:17; 23. 7; 27:5, 6; 31:5-40). And these are exactly what God bore witness to (<a href="../../par/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>). It is plain, then, that Elihu overstated his ease, and, whatever his intentions were, was practically almost as unfair to Job as the "comforters." Neither is there iniquity in me. Nor had Job said this. He had frequently acknowledged the contrary (see <a href="../../par/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>; <a href="../../par/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>).

This charge may perhaps be justified by reference to Job's complaints in <a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-19</a> and Job 10:3-6; but the exact words are not Job's. <span class="cmt_word">He counteth me for his enemy</span>. Certainly, Job had <span class="accented">said</span> this more than ones (see <a href="../../par/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19.htm">Job 19</a>. l 1). But he cannot really have believed it, or his trust in God must have failed. The fact that to the last he clung to God, appealed to him, hoped to receive judgment from him (<a href="../../par/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2, 6, 28, 35-37</a>), is proof sufficient that he knew God was not really alienated from him, but would in the end acknowledge him and vindicate his character.

It would certainly not have been a just charge to make against God, that he counted Job as an enemy; and, so far as Job's statements go, it must be admitted that he had laid himself open to Elihu's rebuke. But it is no logical "answer" <span class="accented">to</span> Job's charge to say, in reply to it, <span class="cmt_word">I will answer thee, that God is greater than man</span>. Might does not constitute right, and it is a poor way of justifying God to urge that he is all-powerful, and may do what he likes. So Cambyses was justified in his worst acts by the royal judges (Herod., 3:31); and so in an absolute monarchy it is always possible to justify the extremest acts of tyranny. Certainly God cannot act unjustly; but this is not because his doing a thing makes it right, but because his justice, is a law to his will, and he never wills to do anything that he has not previously seen to be just (see Cudworth's 'Immutable Morality,' which deserves the careful study, not alone of moralists, but also of theologians).

It is not alone his omnipotence that makes such conduct folly, but his remoteness, his inaccessibility. He cannot be forced to make answer; it is not his wont to do so; he giveth not account of any of his matters. It is presumptuous to suppose that God will condescend to reveal himself from heaven and make answer to thy overbold challenges.

God has his own ways of speaking to man, which are not those that Job has been expecting. He speaks silently and secretly, not in thunders and lightnings, as at Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-20</a>), not by extraordinary theophanies, but nevertheless quite as effectually. Yet man perceiveth it not. Man often does net recognize God's action  in this silent teaching of his. Man wants something more startling, more sensational. In our Lord's time, the Jews demanded "a sign" - "a sign from heaven;" but no sign of the kind was given them. Job now did not understand that God, whom he called upon to answer him (<a href="../../par/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-22.htm">Job 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/job/23-5.htm">Job 23:5</a>, etc.), was already speaking to him in various ways - by his judgments, by thoughts suggested inwardly to his heart, by the dreams and visions whereof he complained (<a href="../../par/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a></div><div class="verse">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a dream, in a vision of the sight</span>. So God spoke to Abimelech (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3-7</a>), to Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11</a>), to Laban (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), to Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5, 9</a>), to the Pharaoh whom Joseph served (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>), to Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>), to Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>), to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-5.htm">Daniel 4:5-18</a>), and to many others. Sometimes men recognized such visions as Divine communications; but sometimes, probably quite as often, they regarded them as mere dreams, fancies, phantasies, unworthy of any attention. Elihu seems to hold that Divine visions came only when deep sleep falleth upon men; and similarly Eliphaz, in <a href="../../par/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>. This method of revelation seems to belong especially to the more primitive times, and the earlier stages of God's dealings with men. In the New Testament dreams scarcely form any part of the economy of grace. <span class="cmt_word">In slumberings upon the bed</span>. A pleonastic addition, which must not be regarded as diminishing from the force of the precedent clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-16.htm">Job 33:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction</span>. At such times, Elihu holds, God gives men spiritual wisdom, instructs them, makes them understand his dealings with them and his purposes with respect to them. If Job is perplexed concerning the Almighty's ways with himself, and desires explanations, let him have his ear open to the Divine teaching on such occasions, and seriously lay it to heart. He will thus, it may be, find his perplexity diminished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17</a></div><div class="verse">That he may withdraw man <i>from his</i> purpose, and hide pride from man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) <span class="cmt_word">may withdraw man from his purpose</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from</span> his work, assumed to be a wrongful work. Elihu regards the Divine teaching through visions as intended to elevate and purify men. Sometimes God so works upon them as to make them abandon an evil course on which they had entered. Sometimes his object is to save them from indulgence in an evil temper into which, without his help, they might have fallen. In this latter case he may occasionally hide pride from man. Elihu, perhaps, thinks that Job is unduly proud of his integrity.

By these interpositions God may even save a man from utter ruin, when, but for them, he would have rushed upon it. He may cause a person -to give up designs or enterprises which would have brought him into danger, and perhaps led to his being slain with the sword.

God also speaks to men, secretly and silently, in another way, viz. through chastisements. He afflicts the strong man with a grievous sickness, causes him to take to his bed, racks him with pain there, and wrings the multitude of his bones with strong pain. But here again his purpose is kind and loving.

And his bones that were not seen stick out. These are general features of a wasting illness (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, "I may tell all my bones").

It is generally supposed that "the angel of the covenant" is meant, and that the whole passage is Messianic; but much obscurity hangs over it. The Jews certainly understand it Messianically, since they read it on the great Day of Atonement, and use in their liturgies the prayer, "Raise up for us the righteous Interpreter; say, I have found a ransom." Elihu's knowledge of an Interpreter, or Mediator, one among a thousand, who should deliver the afflicted man from going down to the pit, and find a ransom for him (ver. 24), is certainly very surprising; and we can scarcely imagine that he understood the full force of his words; but it cannot be right to denude them of their natural signification Elihu certainly did not mean to  speak of himself as an "angel-interpreter, one among a thousand;" and it is not probable that he intends a reference to any merely human helper. <span class="cmt_word">To show unto man. his uprightness</span>; either "to show to a man what it is right for him to do," or "to indicate to a man in what true righteousness consists."

Some interpret, "Then he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) is gracious unto him, and he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the angel) saith. Others make God the subject of both clauses. But the angel is the natural subject. Deliver him from going down to the pit. The mediating angel thus addresses God, and adds, I have found a ransom, leaving the nature of the ransom unexplained. Some notion of ransom, or atonemeat, underlay the whole idea of sacrifice, which appears to have been universally practised from the remotest times, by the Oriental nations.

Elihu, from this point to the end of the chapter, speaks in his own person. God, he says, thus works with man, through visions or through chastisements <span class="accented">oftentimes - not in</span> the latter case, taking vengeance on them for their sins, but graciously leading them on to a better mind and a higher spiritual condition. This is part of God's ordinary moral government, and Job has no need to suppose himself exceptionally dealt with. Elihu has reason on his side in all this, and his words may have given Job some comfort. But they did not exactly fit Job's ease. Elihu, unless supernaturally enlightened, could not possibly penetrate into the special circumstances of Job's trial. He could only try to bring his case under general laws, of which it was not an illustration; and so, though well-meant and probably of some service, his argument was no complete answer to Job's difficulties. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a></div><div class="verse">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To bring back his soul from the pit</span>. For discipline and correction, not for vengeance - in love and not in anger (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>, where the doctrine is set forth fully). To be enlightened with the light of the living; or, <span class="accented">that he may be enlightened.</span> This is God's purpose, ordinarily, in afflicting men; or, at any rate, a part of his purpose He aims at enlightening their understandings, and so enabling them to comprehend his ways, and clearly see the path which it is their true wisdom to walk in. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-31.htm">Job 33:31</a></div><div class="verse">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Mark well what I say. Note it, and lay it up in thy heart." Hold thy peace, and I will speak. It may be conjectured that Job at this point showed some inclination to break silence and answer Elihu. But Elihu thought that he had a great deal more to say, which was of importance, and wished not to be interrupted. He therefore checked Job's utterance. Then, fearing lest he had gone too far, he made the concession of the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-32.htm">Job 33:32</a></div><div class="verse">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou hast anything to say, answer me</span>.

Then, probably, Elihu made a pause, to allow of Job's speaking; but, as the patriarch kept silence, he continued.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/33-33.htm">Job 33:33</a></div><div class="verse">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom</span>. Elihu is certainly quite sufficiently impressed with the sense of his intellectual capacity. Job's silence may have been meant as a sort of tacit rebuke to him. Considering his youth (<a href="../../par/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>), there is something of arrogance in the whole tone of his address, and especially in his notion that he could "teach Job wisdom." It is significant that neither now, when expressly invited to reply, nor at any subsequent point of the discourse, nor even at its close, does Job condescend to make any answer at all to Elihu's speech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 32"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 34"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/job/34.htm"><title>Job 34 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/job/34.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/job/34.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/job/34-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../job/33.htm" title="Job 33">&#9668;</a> Job 34 <a href="../job/35.htm" title="Job 35">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-1.htm">Job 34:1</a></div><div class="verse">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - In this chapter Elihu turns from Job to those whom he addresses as "wise men" (ver. 2), or "men of understanding" (ver. 10). Whether these are Job's three special friends, or others among the company which had perhaps gathered to hear the debate, is uncertain. He makes the subject of his address to them Job's conduct - scarcely a polite thing to do in Job's presence. Job, he says, has scorned God and charged him with injustice (vers. 5-9). He will vindicate him. This he proceeds to do in vers. 10-30. He then points out what Job's course ought to be (vers. 31-33), and winds up by an appeal to the "men of understanding" to endorse his condemnation of Job as a sinner and a rebel (vers. 34-37). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore Elihu answered and said, Hear my words, O ye wise men</span>. Having, as he may have thought, reduced Job to silence by the fame of his reasonings, Elihu, wishing to carry with him the general consent of his audience, makes an appeal to them, or, at any rate, to the wise among them, to judge Job's conduct and pronounce upon it. It is probable, as Schultens remarks, that a considerable number of influential persons had by this time collected together to hear the discussion which was going on. To these Elihu specially addresses himself: <span class="cmt_word">Give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-2.htm">Job 34:2</a></div><div class="verse">Hear my words, O ye wise <i>men</i>; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</div><div class="comm">

A proverbial expression, already used by Job in the dialogue (<a href="../../par/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>).

Job had maintained his "righteousness" in a certain sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his integrity, his honesty, his conviction that God would ultimately acquit him; but he had not maintained his sinlessness (see the comment on Job 33:9). He had not even said, in so many words, "I am righteous." The nearest that he had come to saying it was when (in <a href="../../par/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>) he had exclaimed, "I know that I shall be held righteous," or "justified." <span class="cmt_word">And God hath taken away my judgment</span>. Job had said this (<a href="../../par/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2</a>), but in the sense that God had withheld from him the judgment on his cause which he desired, not that he had perverted judgment, and wrongfully condemned him (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 97).  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-6.htm">Job 34:6</a></div><div class="verse">Should I lie against my right? my wound <i>is</i> incurable without transgression.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Should I lie against my right?</span> This was an essential portion of Job's argument (see <a href="../../par/job/27-4.htm">Job 27:4</a>). Against the theory of his secret heinous wickedness put forward by his "comforters," he maintained consistently his freedom from conscious deliberate opposition to the will of God, and refused to make the confessions which they suggested or required, on the ground that they would have been untrue - in making them he would have "lied against his right." In this certainly Job "sinned not." But it was essential to the theory of Elihu, no less than to that of Eliphaz and his friends, that Job was suffering on account of past iniquity, whether he were being punished for it in anger or chastised for it in love (see <a href="../../par/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My wound</span> (literally, <span class="accented">my arrow</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) <span class="cmt_word">is incurable without transgression</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without my having committed any transgression to account for it.

It was not for Elihu, who professed a desire to "justify" (or completely exonerate) Job, to aggravate his guilt by means of rhetorical comment; and the comment itself was unfair, for Job had not indulged in scorn to any extent, much less "drunk it up like water" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>). He had in no respect scorned God; and if he had occasionally poured some scorn upon his "comforters" (<a href="../../par/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4-13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-2.htm">Job 21:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), must it not be admitted that they had deserved it? It was the duty of Elihu to act as moderator between Job and the "comforters," whereas he here seeks to exasperate them, and lash them up to fury against their afflicted friend. Perhaps Job's impassive attitude has embittered him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-8.htm">Job 34:8</a></div><div class="verse">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity</span>. It is impossible to supply any other antecedent to "which" than Job himself. Elihu therefore accuses Job of having turned aside from righteousness, and betaken himself to the "counsel of the ungodly, the way of sinners, and the seat of the scornful" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). This is grossly to exaggerate Job's faults of temper, and puts Elihu very nearly on a level with Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar in respect of misconception and rudeness. And walketh with wicked men. If no more is meant than that Job has adopted principles and arguments commonly used by wicked men (Canon Cook), the language employed is unfortunate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a></div><div class="verse">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God</span>. Again it must be remarked that Job had not said this. The nearest approach to it is to be found in <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, where this passage occurs: "It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked" (Revised Version). Elsewhere Job speaks, not generally, but of his own individual case, remarking that his righteousness has not saved him from calamity (<a href="../../par/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>-17, etc.). And the fact is one that causes him the deepest perplexity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <i>that he should do</i> wickedness; and <i>from</i> the Almighty, <i>that he should commit</i> iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding</span> (comp. ver. 2). Elihu repeats himself, wishing to call special attention to his justification of God (vers. 10-30). Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness. Elihu probably means that to do wickedness is contrary to the very nature and idea of God; but he does not express himself very clearly. And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. An evil God, a God who can do wrong, is a contradiction in terms - an impossible, inconceivable idea. Devil-worshippers, if there are or ever have been such persons, do not conceive of the object of their worship as really God, but as a powerful malignant spirit. Once rise to the height of the conception of a Power absolutely supreme, omniscient, omnipresent, the Author of all things, and it is impossible to imagine him as less than perfectly good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a></div><div class="verse">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to <i>his</i> ways.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the work of a man shall he render unto him</span>. God "rewardeth every man according to his work" (Psalm 62:13), renders to each one good or evil, according as his own deeds have been the one or the other. But this must be understood of the man's <span class="accented">whole</span> conduct, and God's <span class="accented">entire</span> treatment of him. Such an absolute rectitude of God's moral government, considered as a whole, is implied and involved in his absolute and perfect justice. <span class="cmt_word">And cause every man to find according to his ways</span>. We "find according to our ways" when, having "ploughed iniquity, and sown wickedness, we reap the same" (<a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>), or when, on the other hand, having "sown in righteousness, we reap in mercy" (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>). Exact retribution is the law of God's rule; but the exactness cannot be seen, or tested, or demonstrated in this life. It will appear, however, and be recognized by all, at the consummation of all things. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-12.htm">Job 34:12</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment</span>. Elihu is fond of rhetorical amplification, like most young speakers. Vers. 11, 12 contain nothing that is really additional to the statement in ver. 10. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a></div><div class="verse">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath given him a charge over the earth?</span> The argument seems to be that if God had "received a charge," and were in possession of a mere delegated authority, like the subordinate gods of  heathen nations, he might have an interest apart from that of those whom he governs, and so be tempted to be unjust; but as he is the Author of all and the sole Ruler of all, his interest must be bound up with the true interests of his creatures, and cannot clash with them. He can thus never be unjust, since he can have no temptation to be unjust. <span class="cmt_word">Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Who hath laid upon him the whole world?</span> (see the margin of the Revised Version). Elihu repeats the idea of the previous clause in other words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a></div><div class="verse">If he set his heart upon man, <i>if</i> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath</span>. Two renderings are proposed, both supported By about equal authority: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "If he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) set his heart upon <span class="accented">himself</span>, if he should gather to himself <span class="accented">his own</span> spirit, and breath," then all flesh would perish, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "If he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God] set his heart upon [or, 'against'] <span class="accented">man</span>, if he were to gather to himself man's spirit and man's breath," then, etc. The difference is not great. God could, either by withdrawing from man the breath and spirit which he has given him, or simply by withholding from man the quickening and sustaining influences which he is perpetually putting forth, reduce all humankind to nothingness. Being so completely master of man, he would surely not condescend to treat him with injustice. Injustice implies something of opposition, struggle, rivalry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a></div><div class="verse">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All flesh shall perish together</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). Without God's sustaining hand, all creatures would fall back into nothingness. And man shall turn again unto dust, Either Elihu refers here to <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, or else he has a traditional knowledge of man's origin, handed down from a remote antiquity, which is in entire conformity with the Hebrew belief. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a></div><div class="verse">If now <i>thou hast</i> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If now thou hast understanding, hear this</span>.

The appeal is to the instinctive feeling that in the one God perfect goodness and omnipotence are united. Its spirit is exactly that of Abraham's question, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span> rather, <span class="accented">him that is both just and strong</span> (see the Revised Version).

Would he even tax those who stood next to the king - the princes and great officers of the court - with ungodliness? If a sense of what is becoming and seemly would restrain a man from the use of language of this sort towards his earthly ruler, can it be right that he should allow himself in such liberty or speech towards his heavenly King, his absolute Lord and Master? Job had not really used such language of God, though the complaints which he had made with respect to God's treatment of him might not unreasonably be held to imply some such accusation.

(So Rosenmuller and others.) If the passage be thus rendered, Elihu must be considered as, like Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8</a>), Bildad (<a href="../../par/job/8-5.htm">Job 8:5</a>), and Zophar (<a href="../../par/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13-15</a>), counselling Job to submit himself to God, acknowledging his sin, accepting his punishment, and promising amendment for the future (ver. 22). But perhaps it is better to regard the passage as interrogative, and Elihu as asking - What man, among those whom God has cast down and punished, has ever sought to deprecate his wrath by contrition, confession, and promise of amendment, implying that, had they done so, God would have relented and forgiven them? (see the Revised Version). In this case no direct counsel is offered to Job; but still an indirect hint is given him. <span class="cmt_word">I will not offend any more</span>.

As Job does not answer him, Elihu turns to his "men of understanding" (supra, vers. 2, 10). He feels sure that he will at least have carried them with him, and that they will join in the condemnation of Job's words as wanting in true wisdom. "Men of understanding," he says, "will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me will say, Job speaketh without knowledge," etc. (see the Revised Version).

Job must not think, Elihu means, that, because his good actions benefit and his bad actions injure his fellow men, therefore they must also in the one case injure and in the other benefit God. The cases are not parallel. God is too remote, too powerful, too great, to be touched by his actions. Job has done wrong, therefore, to expect that God would necessarily reward his righteousness by prosper us, happy life, and worse to complain because his expectations have been disappointed. It is of his mere spontaneous goodness and bounty that God rewards the godly.

Job should have patience and trust. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by reason</span> <span class="accented">of the multitude of oppressions</span>, <span class="accented">men cry out.</span> It is not Job only who cries to God. Oppressors are numerous; the oppressed are numerous; everywhere there are complaints and outcries. They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. The oppressors are, for the most part, the mighty of the earth - kings, princes, nobles (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>, etc.).

Elihu probably alludes to Job's defence of his complaints as natural, like the instinctive cries of beasts and birds (<a href="../../par/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>). God, he says, has given to man a higher nature than he has bestowal on the brutes; and this nature should teach him to carry his griefs to God in a proper spirit- a spirit of faith, piety, humility, and resignation. If men cried to him in this spirit, they would obtain an answer. If they do not obtain an answer, it must be that the proper spirit is lacking (comp. <a href="../../par/james/4-3.htm">James 4:3</a>).

They constitute a final appeal to Job, who is exhorted to submission, resignation, and patience, in consideration of God's inscrutability, and of his perfect justice, wisdom, and strength. Ch. 36 begins with a short preface (vers. 1-4), in which Elihu seeks to prove his right to offer counsel to Job, after which God's justice is demonstrated (vers. 5-16), and Job warned that his petulance may lead to his complete destruction (vers. 17-25). Finally, in illustration of God's might and unsearchableness' the description of a thunderstorm is commenced (vers. 26-33), which is carried on into the next chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elihu also proceeded, and said, Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that there are yet words for God.</span> The controversy, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, is not exhausted; there is yet much that may be urged on God's behalf, in respect of the charges thou hast made against him.

The words sound arrogant; but perhaps Elihu does not mean any more than W pledge himself to speak truthfully, and to say only what he has perfect knowledge cf.

The preface over, the argument to prove God's justice begins. First, he "is mighty." How unlikely that any one who is mighty - nay, almighty - should be unjust! Next, he despiseth not any. Job has wrongly charged him with "despising the work of his own hands." In truth, he despises nothing that he has made. "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29, 30</a>). Much less, then, is any man despised.

God, by his chastisements, makes men see what has been faulty in their life's work, in what respects they have been negligent, where they have lapsed into actual sin. Signal afflictions are a call to men to "consider their ways," and search out the nature of their offences. Some afflictions, as sickness and imprisonment, by depriving men of active employment, almost force them to engage in such a retrospect. <span class="cmt_word">And their transgressions that they have exceeded</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their transgressions</span> <span class="accented">wherein they have behaved themselves proudly</span> (compare the Revised Version).

It is the especial merit of Elihu's theory of suffering that he views it as far less penal than disciplinary and restorative. Job's sufferings especially he views in this light. Instead of looking upon Job, like his other friends, as a heinous sinner, upon whom Go, I is taking vengeance, he regards him as a person who is being chastised, <span class="accented">in love</span>, for some fault or faults that he has committed, to his ultimate advantage and improvement. This, though not exactly the truth, is far nearer the truth than the view taken by the other three "friends." <span class="cmt_word">And commandeth that they return from iniquity</span>.

In his vindication of God's justice, Elihu here passes from the case of the righteous (ver. 7) to that of the "hypocrites," or rather the ungodly. They, he says, "heap up wrath," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), continually intensify God's anger against them, and, as it were, lay in a store of it, which will one day be outpoured upon them<span class="cmt_word">. They cry not when he bindeth them</span>. They do not cry to him, they do not deprecate his anger, when they first find themselves bound with the "cords of affliction" (ver. 8), but allow his wrath to increase and accumulate.

Elihu recurs to what he had said in ver. 10 with respect to the discipline of affliction. The bulk of the afflictions sent by God are, according to him, intended to act medicinally. If the afflicted man receives them aright, they are the very means of his deliverance (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67, 71</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And openeth their ears in oppression</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by suffering.</span> Their sufferings lead them to God, cause them to pay more attention to his Word, lead them to open their ears to his inward voice.

Another quite different interpretation has been proposed by Ewald, and adopted by Dillmann and Canon Cook, who suppose Elihu to speak, not of what would have happened to Job under certain circumstances, but of what had actually happened to him, and render, "Thee moreover hath thy unbounded prosperity seduced from listening to the voice of affliction, and the case of thy table which was full of fatness." But the rendering of the Authorized Version, which is substantially that of Schultens and Rosenmuller, is still upheld by many scholars, and has been retained by our Revisers. If we adopt it, we must understand Elihu as assuring Job that he too would have been delivered and restored to his prosperity, if he had accepted his afflictions in a proper <span class="accented">spirits</span> and learnt the lesson they were intended to teach him (see vers. 9, 10).

The original is exceedingly obscure, and three or four quite distinct renderings have been proposed; but one of the latest critics (Professor Stanley Loathes) prefers to all the other translations that of the Authorized Version. Job is threatened by Elihu with a coming judgment which shall remove him from the earth altogether. Then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. Once let destruction fall, and there is no longer any place for ransom. <span class="accented">Nothing</span> can then deliver thee from thy just punishment.

This is an allusion to Job's repeatedly expressed desire to be cut off at once, and laid in the grave (<a href="../../par/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a>, etc.).

Whilst thou art careful to preserve thy integrity and faith in God, do not fall into sin in other respects - as by impatient desires, or proud thoughts, or rash accusations of God. For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. Rather than acquiesce in thy afflictions and bear them patiently, thou hast elected to murmur, to complain, to question the justice of God, and speak overboldly concerning him. There is some ground for Elihu's condemnation;  but it is excessive; it fails to make allowance for the extremity of Job's sufferings, and the disturbing influence of extreme suffering on the mind and judgment. It is, at any rate, more severe than God's judgment upon his servant (<a href="../../par/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>).

Who teacheth like him? This has been called "the key-note of Elihu's whole discourse" (Cook). The entire providential government of the world by God he views as didactic, as a series of moral lessons addressed to men by their Maker (see <a href="../../par/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, etc.).

While God is thus the universal and all-perfect Teacher, there are some who would fain instruct him, dictate the course which he ought to pursue, improve and amend his universe. Something of this spirit has appeared in Job's remonstrances, which seem to insinuate that the Divine government of the world might be carried on better than it is (see <a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-26</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11-17</a>, etc.).

Men are looking on, anxiously considering Job's sufferings; he is a spectacle to them, as the apostles were to men and angels (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>), and the more reason therefore that he should, by patient endurance, by submission and confession, cause his sufferings to redound to the glory and honour of God.

It is suggested that the storm, which ultimately broke at the theophania (<a href="../../par/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>), was already beginning to gather, and turned the thoughts of Elihu in this direction. He begins with the consideration of how rain is generated, passes rapidly to the gathering of the clouds from all quarters, and thence to the loud crashing of the thunder, and the dazzling flashes of the lightning, which illumine even the lowest depths of the sea (ver. 30). The effects of the storm are then spoken of, in words the exact meaning of which is very obscure (vers. 31-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God is great, and we know him not</span>. This is the final lesson which Elihu seeks to impress on his hearers. God is so great their fully to comprehend him transcends the power of the human understanding. However much we know of him, there is more that we do not know. His nature is unsearchable; his depths (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) are inscrutable; try as we may, we can never "find him out" (<a href="../../par/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither can the number of his years be searched out</span>.

The phenomenon of snow is always full of marvel to an Oriental. It comes before him so seldom; it is in itself so strange; it involves things so inexplicable as the sudden solidification of a liquid, crystallization, a marked expansion of bulk, and the sudden assumption by what was colourless of a definite and dazzling colour. In Arabia and the countries bordering on Palestine snow very seldom falls; but in Palestine itself the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Hermon are never without it; and in the region occupied by Job and his friends then is reason to believe that ice and snow were not altogether infrequent (see <a href="../../par/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Likewise to the small rain</span>; or, <span class="accented">to the light shower of rain -</span> "the spring rain," as the Chaldee paraphrast explains it. And to the great rain of his strength; or, "the heavy winter rain," according to the same authority. "The former and the latter rain" - the rain of winter, and the rain of spring - are often mentioned by the sacred writers (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>).

Rain is the chief necessity of Eastern countries; and God is ever providing it, causing moisture to be drawn up from earth and sea, and safely lodged in the clouds, whence it descends, as needed, and as commanded by God, upon the fields and plains that man cultivates. <span class="cmt_word">He scattereth his bright cloud</span>. Most commentators see a reference to lightning here; and it is possible, no doubt, that such a reference is intended. "His bright cloud" - literally, "the cloud of his light" - may mean "the cloud in which his lightning is stored." But perhaps no more is meant than that God spreads abroad over the earth the clouds on which his sunlight rests. The genial showers of spring fall generally from clouds that are, in part at any rate, steeped in the sun's rays.

The translation, "looking-glass," is wrong, both here and in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, since glass was not used for mirrors until the period of the early Roman empire.

This is probably the true meaning, though another has been suggested by some commentators, who prefer to render, "Or should a man wish that he were destroyed?"

He will begin with interrogatories which Job must answer; then Job will be entitled to put questions to him. Job, however, on the opportunity being given him, shrinks back, and says, "Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken: but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further" (<a href="../../par/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4, 5</a>). The confident boldness which he felt when God seemed far off disappears in his presence, and is replaced by diffidence and distrust.

The stars generally, or the actual stars visible on the morn of creation, are probably meant. They, as it were, sang a song of loud acclaim on witnessing the new marvel.

God's might is especially shown in his power to control and confine the sea, which rages so terribly and seems so utterly uncontrollable. God has blocked it in "with doors" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with "bounds that it cannot pass, neither turn again to cover the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). Sometimes the barrier is one of lofty and solid rock, which seems well suited to confine and restrain; but sometimes it is no more than a thin streak of sliver sand or a bank of loose, shifting pebbles. Yet, in both cases alike, the restraint suffices. "The sand is placed for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>); the beach of shifting pebbles remains as firm as the rock itself, and never recedes or advances more than a few feet. <span class="cmt_word">When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at its birth, when it was first formed, by the gathering together of the waters into one place (see <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>).

Representations of such folding-doors are common in the Assyrian sculptures; and in one instance the doors themselves, or, to speak more exactly, their outer bronze easing, has been recovered (see a paper in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' on the Bronze Gates discovered by Mr. Rassam at Balawat, vol. 7. pp. 85-115).

The law is not quite absolute. Wherever the sea washes a coast-line, there is a continual erosive action, whereby the land is, little by little, eaten away, and the line of the coast thrust back. But the action is so slow that millennia pass without any considerable effect being produced, and encroachments in some places are generally counterbalanced by retrenchment in others, so that the general contour of laud and water, with the proportion of the one to the other, remain probably very much the same at the present day as when the earth first became the habitation of man. <span class="cmt_word">And here shall thy proud waves be stayed</span>. The waves of the sea "rage horribly," and every now and then topple down a rock or undermine a cliff, and seem proud of their achievements; but how little do they effect, even in thousands of years! The little islet of Psyttaleia still blocks the eastern end of the straits of Salamis. The Pharos island lies off the westernmost mouth of the Nile. Even the low, fiat Aradus, on the Syrian coast, has not been swept away. Everywhere the waves are practically "stayed," and all the menaces of the sea against the land come to nought.

The wicked, lovers of darkness, are taken by surprise, and receive a shock from which they recover with difficulty (comp. <a href="../../par/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16, 17</a>).

By "the deep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>) is certainly not meant here either the open ocean, which, in the latitudes known to the dwellers in South Western Asia, never freezes, or the Mediterranean. Some of the lakes which abound in the regions inhabited by Job and his friends are probably meant.

Whether the "sweet influences" of the constellation are here spoken of is very doubtful. Schultens and Professor Lee support the rendering; but most critics prefer to translate the word employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) by "chains" or "fastenings" (Rashi, Kimchi, Rosenmuller, Dillmann, Canon Cook).

This makes it impossible to accept the meaning, so generally assigned, of "the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Again, the plural form is fatal to the conjecture that "Mazzaroth" designates a single star or planet, as Jupiter, Venus, or Sirius (Cook). The word is derived probably from the root zahar, "to shine," "to be bright," and should designate some especially brilliant cluster of stars Whether it is to be regarded as a variant of <span class="accented">Mazzaloth</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>) is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</span> (On the identity of '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> with the Great Bear, see the comment on Job 9:9.)

The general prevalence of law in the material world is quite as strongly asserted by the sacred writers as by modern science. The difference is that modern science regards the laws as physical necessities, self-subsisting, while Scripture looks upon them as the ordinances of the Divine will. This latter view involves, of course, the further result that the Divine will can at any time suspend or reverse any of its enactments. <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</span> If Job does not even know the laws whereby the world is governed, much less can he establish such laws himself, and make them work.

Great is their strength, and great their speed; nor do they spare man nor beast, when once they have caught sight of him. ...

The allusion is, perhaps, to the flapping of its wings by the ostrich, as it hurries over the ground, which is sore, thing like that of a cock before crowing or after beating an antagonist. Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? This clause is very obscure, but may perhaps mean, <span class="accented">Are her feathers and plumage kindly?</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does she use them for the same kindly purpose as other birds - to warm her eggs, and forward the process of hatching them?

It is evidently this habit of the bird that is here alluded to. That in cooler countries ostriches do not do this is not to the point. The habit was known in Job's time, and was so noticeable as to characterize the bird to a large extent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/39-15.htm">Job 39:15</a></div><div class="verse">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</span> Where the eggs are covered by a layer of sand a foot thick, this danger is not incurred. But when the eggs are numerous - and they are sometimes as many as thirty - they are apt to be very poorly covered, and the results follow which are described in the text.

Recent careful observation of the habits of the ostrich indicates that the parental instinct is not wanting, though it may be weaker than in most birds. Both the male and the female incubate at night, and, when the nest is approached by the hunter, the parent bird or birds will leave it, and try to draw him away from it by running on in front of him, or feigning to attack him, much as peewits do in our own country. <span class="cmt_word">Her labour is in vain without fear</span>; or, <span class="accented">though her labour is in vain</span>, <span class="accented">she is without fear</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though she is often disappointed of her immediate hope of offspring, through her eggs being crushed and destroyed, yet she grows no wiser, she does not fear for the future.

There is an Arab proverb - "As stupid as an ostrich" - which the Arabs justify on five grounds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The ostrich, they say, will swallow iron, stones, leaden bullets, and other things, which injure and sometimes prove fatal to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When hunted, it thrusts its head into a hush, and iron,nee that the hunter does not see it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It allows itself to be captured by transparent devices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It neglects its eggs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Its head is small, and contains but a small quantity of brains. To these grounds I may add that in the South-African ostrich-farms, the birds allow themselves to be confined within a certain space by a fence of sticks and string raised about a foot from the ground. They seem to think that they cannot step over it.

The ostrich sometimes tries to elude pursuit by crouching and hiding behind hillocks or in hollows, making itself as little conspicuous as possible; but, when these attempts fail, and it starts off to run in the open, then it "lifts itself up" to its full elevation, beats the air with its wings, and scours along at a pace that no horse can equal. The Greeks with Xenophon, though well mounted, failed to catch a single ostrich ('Anab.,' 1:5. &sect; 3).

Canon Cook appositely compares Virgil's "carat tellurem" ('Georg.,' 3:87, 88), and Professor Lee Pope's expression, that "ere they start a thousand steps are lost." The verb is in the plural, because a line of cavalry, all pawing and eager to be off, is intended to be represented. And rejoiceth in his strength.

In the Aasyrian sculptures the quiver of mounted archers is often hung at the side, instead of at the back.

This is a common metaphor to denote the rapidity with which the horse covers the space that lies before him. Virgil has, "Corripiuut spatia" ('AEnid,' 5:316); Silius ltalions, "Campum volatu rapucre" (3:308); Shakespeare, "He seemed in running to devour the way."

(So Schultens, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.) But most recent critics prefer to render, "He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth," and compare Virgil's "Stare loco nescit" ('Georg.,' 3:84).

The phrase, "opened his mouth," is not to be dismissed merely as a Hebraism. It is one used only on solemn occasions, and implies the utterance of deep thoughts, well considered beforehand (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>), or of feelings long repressed, and now at length allowed expression. <span class="cmt_word">And cursed his day</span>; "cursed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the "day of his birth." Some critics think that "cursed" is too strong a word, and suggest "reviled;" but it cannot be denied that "to curse" is a frequent meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> and it is difficult to see in Job's words (vers. 3-10) anything but a "curse" of a very intense character. To curse one's natal day is not, perhaps, a very wise act, since it can have no effect on the day or on anything else; but so great a prophet as Jeremiah imitated Job in this respect (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>), so that before Christianity it would seem that men were allowed thus to relieve their feelings. All that such cursing means is that one wishes one had never been born.

An idle wish, doubtless; the vague utterance of extreme despair. Days cannot perish, or, at any rate, one day cannot perish more than another. They all come, and then are gone; but no day can perish out of the year, which will always have its full complement of three hundred and sixty-five days till time shall be no more. But extreme despair does not reason. It simply gives utterance to the thoughts and wishes as they arise. Job knew that many of his thoughts were vain and foolish, and confesses it further on (see <a href="../../par/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the night in which it was said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which said.</span> Day and night are, both of them, personified, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">There is a man child conceived</span>.

"The shadow of death" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) is a favourite expression in the Book of Job, where it occurs no fewer than nine times. Elsewhere it is rare, except in the Psalms, where it occurs four times. It is thought to be an archaic word. <span class="cmt_word">Stain it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">claim it</span>, or <span class="accented">claim it for their own</span> (<span class="accented">Revised</span> Version). <span class="cmt_word">Let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it</span>. The hot, stifling "blackness" of the khamsin wind is probably meant, which suddenly turns the day into night, spreading all around a thick lurid darkness. When such  a wind arises, we are told, "The sky instantly becomes black and heavy; the sun loses its splendour, and appears of a dim violet hue; a light, warm breeze is felt, which gradually increases in heat till it almost equals that of an oven. Though no vapour darkens the air, it becomes so grey and thick with the floating clouds of impalpable sand, that it is sometimes necessary to use candles at noonday" (Russell, 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 55).

The night, that is, of Job's conception (see above, ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Let darkness seize upon it</span>. The Revised Version has <span class="accented">thick darkness</span> but this is unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be joined unto the days of the year</span>. According to the Massorites' pointing, we should translate, "Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;" and so the Revised Version. But many of the best critics prefer the pointing which is followed by the LXX. and by King James's translators. The succeeding clause strongly supports this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Let it not come into the number of the months</span> (comp. ver. 3, and the comment on it). Job <span class="accented">wishes</span> the day of his birth and the night of his conception to be utterly blotted out from the calendar; but, aware that this is impossible, he subsides into a milder class of imprecations.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them curse it that curse the day</span>. Very different explanations are given of this passage. Some suppose it to mean, "Let those desperate men curse it who are in the habit of cursing their day," like Job himself (<a href="../../par/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a>). Others suggest a reference to such as claimed power to curse days, and to divide them into the lucky and the unlucky. In this case Job would mean, "Let the sorcerers who curse days curse especially this day," and would thus seem, if not to sanction the practice, at any rate to express a certain amount of belief in the sorcerers' power. The second clause has also a double interpretation, which adapts it to either of these two suggested meanings (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Who are ready to raise up their mourning</span>. This is an impossible rendering. Translate (with the Revised Version), who <span class="accented">are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span> "Rousing leviathan" may be understood in two ways. It may be regarded as spoken in the literal sense of those who are rash enough and desperate enough to stir up the fury of the crocodile (see the comment on Job 41:1), or in a metaphorical sense of such as stir up to action by their sorceries the great power of evil, symbolized in Oriental mythologies by a huge serpent, or dragon, or crocodile. On the whole, the second and deeper sense seems preferable; and we may conceive of Job as believing in the power of sorcery, and wishing it used against the night which he so much dislikes.

Many of the ancients thought that it was best not to be born; and next best, if one were born, to quit the earth as soon as possible. Herodotus says that with the Trauri, a tribe of Thracians, it was the custom, whenever a child was born, for all its kindred to sit round it in a circle, and weep for the woes that it would have to endure now that it was come into the world; while, on the other hand, whenever a person died, they buried him with laughter and rejoicings, since they said that he was now free from a host of sufferings, and enjoyed the completest happiness (Herod., 5:4). Sophocles expresses the feeling with great terseness and force: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (Ed. Col., 1225-1228): "Not to be born is best of all; once born, next best it is by far to go back there from whence one came as speedily as possible." Modern pessimism sums up all in the phrase that "life is not worth living." <span class="cmt_word">Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span> As so often, the  second clause of the distich repeats the idea of the first, merely varying the phraseology.

As a great man himself, nobly born probably, Job expects that his place in another world would have been with kings and nobles (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>, where the King of Babylon, on entering Sheol, finds himself among "all the kings of the nations"). <span class="cmt_word">Which built desolate places for themselves</span>.

The brevity studied by the writer makes his meaning somewhat obscure.

This may either mean simply," princes who were rich in silver and gold during their lifetime," or "princes who have gold and silver buried with them in their tombs." It was the custom in Egypt, in Phoenicia, and elsewhere throughout the East, to bury large quantities of treasure, especially gold and silver vessels, and jewellery, in the sepulchres of kings and other great men. A tomb of a Scythian king in the Crimea, opened about fifty years ago, contained a golden shield, a golden diadem, two silver vases, a vase in electrum, and a number of ornaments, partly in electrum and partly in gold (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 59, 3rd edit.). Another Scythian tomb near the Caspian, opened by the Russian authorities, contained ornaments set with rubies and emeralds, together with four sheets of gold, weighing forty pounds. A third, near Asterabad, contained a golden goblet, weighing seventy ounces; a pot, eleven ounces, and two small trumpets. The tombs of the kings and queens in Egypt were so richly supplied with treasure that, in the time of the twentieth dynasty, a thieves' society was formed for plundering them, especially of their golden ornaments (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 247, 1st edit.). The tomb of Cyrus the Great contained, we are told (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 6:29), a golden couch, a golden table set out with drinking-cups, a golden bowl, and much elegant clothing adorned with gems. Phoenician tombs, in Cyprus especially, have recently yielded enormous treasures (Di Cesnola, 'Cyprus,' pp. 310-316). If the "gold" and "silver" of the present passage refer to treasures buried with princes and kings, we must understand by the "houses" of the second clause their tombs. The Egyptians called their tombs their "eternal abodes" (Diod. Sic., 1:51).

"There" is equivalent to "in the grave." <span class="cmt_word">The wicked cease from troubling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> cease from their state of continual perturbation and unrest" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>, "But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt "). This is their condition, so long as they live; nothing satisfies them; they are always in trouble themselves, and always causing trouble to others. In the grave alone do they rest, or seem to rest. And there the weary be at rest; literally, <span class="accented">the weary in strength</span> or "in respect of strength;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those whose strength is utterly exhausted and worn out.

Such talk is, however, foolish, as is all captious questioning concerning the ways of God. The proper answer to all such questioning is well given by Zophar in <a href="../../par/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7, 8</a>, "Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?

And hence treasure-seeking became a profession, which was pursued with avidity by a large number of persons. Even at the present day Orientals are so possessed with the idea, that they imagine every European, who is eager to unearth antiquities, must be seeking for buried treasure.

Job speaks as if he knew of such cases; and, no doubt, the fact of suicide proves that among men there are some who prefer to die rather than live. But suicides are seldom altogether in possession of their senses.

The word translated "roaring" is used primarily of the roar of a lion (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>); secondarily, of the loud cries uttered by men who suffer pain (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>). (On the loud cries of Orientals when suffering from grief or pain, see the comment on Job 2:12.) Like the waters; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> freely and copiously, without let or stint. Perhaps the loud sound of rushing water is also alluded to.

The second clause, And that which I was (rather, am) afraid of is come unto me, merely repeats and emphasizes the first (see the comment on ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a></div><div class="verse">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came</span>. Some Hebraists give quite a different turn to this passage, rendering it as follows: "I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble cometh" (see the Revised Version, and compare Canon Cook's rendering in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 29, "I have no peace, nor quiet, nor rest; but trouble cometh "). Professor Lee, however, certainly one of the most eminent of modern Hebraists, maintains that the far more pregnant meaning of the Authorized Version gives the true sense. "If I rightly apprehend," he says, "the drift of the context here, Job means to have it understood that he is conscious of no instance in which he has relaxed from his religious obligations; of no season in which his fear and love of God have waxed weak; and, on this account, it was the more perplexing that such a complication of miseries had befallen him" ('The Book of Job' pp. 201, 202);  and he translates the passage (ibid., p. 121), "I slackened not, neither was I quiet, neither took I rest; yet trouble came." Job's complaint is thus far more pointedly terminated than by a mere otiose statement that, "without rest or pause, trouble came upon trouble." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/job/40.htm"><title>Job 40 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/job/40.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/job/40.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/job/40-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../job/39.htm" title="Job 39">&#9668;</a> Job 40 <a href="../job/41.htm" title="Job 41">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/40-1.htm">Job 40:1</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - Between the first and the second part of the Divine discourse, at the end of which Job wholly humbles himself (<a href="../../par/job/42-1.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>), is interposed a short appeal on the part of the Almighty, and a short reply on Job's part, which, however, is insufficient. God calls upon Job to make good his charges (vers. 1, 2). Job declines, acknowledges himself to be of no account, and promises silence and submission for the future (vers. 3-5).

The argument falls under three heads - Can Job cope with God in his general providence (vers? 6-14)? can he even cope with two of God's creatures - with <span class="accented">behemoth</span> or the hippopotamus (vers. 15-24); with <span class="accented">leviathan</span>, or the crocodile (<a href="../../par/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>)? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - This passage, together with the whole of ch. 41, has been regarded by some critics as an interpolation. Its omission would certainly not affect the argument; and it is thought, in some respects, to contain traces of a later age than that which most commentators assign to the remainder of the book, or, at any rate, to the greater portion of it. The recurrence to the animal creation, when the subject seemed to have been completed (<a href="../../par/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>), is also a difficulty. But, on the other hand, as there is no variation, either in the manuscripts or in the versions, and no marked difference either of style or tone of thought between the rest of the book and this controverted passage, it is best regarded as an integral portion of the work, proceeding from the same author, although perhaps at a later period. No one denies that the style is that of the best Hebrew poetry, or that the book would be weakened by the excision of the passage. "Le style," says M. Renan, "est celui des meilleurs endroits du poeme. Nulle part la coupe n'est pins vigoreuse, le parallelisme plus sonore.' <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold now behemoth</span>. "Behemoth" is ordinarily the plural of <span class="accented">behemah</span>  "a beast;" but it is scarcely possible to understand the word in this sense in the present passage, where it seems to be a noun singular, being followed by singular verbs, and represented by singular pronouns. Hence modern critics almost unanimously regard the word here as designating "some particular animal." The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which I made with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "which I created at the same time as I created thee" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He eateth grass as an ox</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is graminivorous, not carnivorous. This is admitted to be true of the hippopotamus, which lives in the Nile during the day, and at night emerges from the river, and devastates the crops of sugar-cane, rice, and millet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a></div><div class="verse">Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins, and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo now, his strength is in his loins</span>. The strength of the hippopotamus is its principal characteristic. Weighing often two thousand kilogrammes, and of a short thick make, when roused to anger it has a force which is irresistible. In the water it upsets large beats; on land it forces its way through dense thickets and fences of all kinds. The loins are especially strong, being deep, broad, and immensely muscular<span class="cmt_word">. And his force is in the navel of his belly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the muscles of his bell'i.</span> The word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) occurs only in this place. It is a plural form, and therefore cannot designate a single object, like the navel. The root seems to be the Syriac <span class="accented">serir</span> "firm," whence Schultens proposes to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="accented">firmitates.</span>

These are hollow, being filled with marrow, and are so strong that they may be well compared to "tubes of bronze." (On the identity of <span class="accented">nekhushah or nekhosheth</span> with "bronze" rather than "brass," see the article on "Brass," in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 225.)

This is the main argument in favour of the elephant, rather than the hippopotamus, being intended (see Schultens, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). It has, indeed, been argued that some specimens of the hippopotamus exceed the elephant in height and bulk (Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 19); but no modern naturalist certainly would place the former animal above the latter in any <span class="accented">catalogue raisonee</span> of animals arranged according to their size and importance. The elephant, however, may not have been known to the author of Job, or, at any rate, the Asiatic species, which seems not to have been imported into Assyria before the middle of the  <span class="date">ninth century B.C.</span> In this case, the hippopotamus might well seem to him the grandest of the works of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him</span>. This is explained to mean, "Only God can attack behemoth with success and slay him; man is powerless to do so" (Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). But the Egyptians, from very early times, used to attack the hippopotamus and slay him (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2, p. 100). It is better, therefore, to translate the passage, with Schultens, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword," and to understand by "his sword" those sharp teeth with which the hippopotamus is said to "cut the grass as <span class="accented">neatly as if it were mown</span> and to sever, as <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">with shears</span> a tolerably stout and thick stem" (Wood, ' Natural History,' vol. 1. p. 762).

The dense shade of trees is sought alike by the hippopotamus and the elephant. <span class="cmt_word">In the covert of the reed, and fens.</span> This is exactly descriptive of the hippopotamus; far less so of the elephant. Gordon Cumming says, "At every turn there occurred deep still pools, and occasional sandy islands, densely clad with lofty reeds Above and beyond these reeds stood trees of immense age. beneath which grew a rank kind of grass, on which the sea-cow (hippopotamus) delights to pasture" ('Lion-Hunter of South Africa,' p. 297).

This last application is now almost universally accepted. The crocodile was fished for by the Egyptians with a hook, and in the time of Herodotus was frequently caught and killed (Herod., 2:70); but probably in Job's day no one had been so venturous as to attack him. <span class="cmt_word">Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</span> rather, or press <span class="accented">down his tongue with a cord?</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "tie a rope round his lower jaw, and so press down his tongue."

A tame crocodile would certainly seem to be an extraordinary pet, but Herodotus says that the Egyptians tamed them (2:39), and Sir Gardner Wilkinson informed me that he had known some tame ones at Cairo. The Mesopotamian Arabs domesticate falcons to assist them in the chase of the bustard and the gazelle (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 481-483).

The skin of the crocodile is penetrable in very few places, and his capture by a single man with a harpoon, though now sometimes practised (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 99), is still a work of danger and difficulty. Or his head with fish-spears? Fish-spears would have small effect on the head of a crocodile, which is bony and covered by a very tough skin. There is a vulnerable place, however, at the point where the head joins the spine, at which the ancient Egyptians, when they ventured to attack the crocodile, were wont to strike (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 545).

"A rifle-ball," according to Canon Tristram, "glances off from them as from a rock" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 352).

"Neesings" is old English for "sneezings." According to Aristotle, the crocodile is in the habit of sneezing, but I do not find this fact noted by modern writers Boehart asserts it very positively ('Hieroz.,' pp. 752-754), but he does not profess to speak from his own knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning</span>. This probably does not mean more than that his eyes flash with light upon occasion, which is no doubt true, though the eyes, being small, have not generally attracted very much attention.

The intention is to  represent the impression which the animal would make on an impressible but unscientific observer viewing it in its native haunts for the first time. Splashing, snorting, and throwing up spray all around, it would seem to be breathing out steam and smoke, from which the idea of fire is inseparable (see the next verse).

All the representations of dragons breathing smoke and flames, found in the myths and sagas of so many countries, probably rest upon the observed fact of team or spray streaming forth from the mouth and widely opened nostrils of the crocodile. The steam has seemed to be smoke, and smoke has naturally suggested flame and fire.

It has been well remarked that the whale has no neck, or at any rate none {hat is visible, while the crocodile has one that is of great strength, and that naturally attracts observation. "Le cou assez marque," says the 'Dictionnaire des Sciences' (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). It is nearly of the same diameter with the head at the point of junction, and where it adjoins the body is still larger.

Whithersoever he proceeds, he causes terror; people tremble, take to flight, and disappear.

Some regard this as intended physically, and note that the great saurians, with their cold and sluggish circulation, have hearts which are comparatively torpid, not contracting or expanding readily. Others take the "stony heart" to mean a fierce and obstinate disposition. In either case, the description will well suit the crocodile. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone</span>. A repetition and slight exaggeration of the preceding idea.

Egyptian historians said that one of their early kings had been slain by a crocodile (Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 1:20, p. 98). The worship paid to crocodiles in some parts of Egypt, and the hatred felt towards them in others, were probably alike inspired by fear. AElian says that, in the districts where crocodiles were worshipped, it was not safe for any one to wash his feet or to draw water at the river, and that in the vicinity of some towns people did not dare to walk along the bank of the stream ('Nat. An.,' 10:24). In modern times they have been known to precipitate men from the bank into the water by a sweep of their tail, and then to devour them at their leisure. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of breakings they purify themselves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they are confounded.</span> The "breakings" may by either the breakings forth of the animal from his lair among the Nile rushes, or his "breaking" of the weapons of his assailants.

The sacrifice takes place (ver. 9); and then a brief account is appended of Job's after life - his prosperity, his reconciliation with his family and friends, his wealth, his sons and daughters, and his death in a good old age, when he was "full of days" (vers. 10-17.).

The literal use of this phrase is common, the metaphorical use of it uncommon, in Scripture. Still, it is so simple a metaphor, and captivity so common a thing among ancient peoples, that it may well have been in general use among the nations of Western Asia from very primitive times. It signifies, as Professor Lee remarks, "a restoration to former happy circumstances." When he prayed for his friends. Perhaps his complete forgiveness by God was contingent on his own complete forgiveness of his "friends" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-32.htm">Matthew 18:32-35</a>); at any rate, his restoration immediately followed his intercession.

Job's "brethren," and his desertion by them in his misfortunes, had been mentioned in <a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>.

Job, like other wealthy and prosperous men had during the time of his prosperity had "troops of friends" (see <a href="../../par/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8-10, 21-25</a>). When adversity swooped down they fell away. Now they had the effrontery to claim his acquaintance once more, and to come and be his guests; they did eat bread with him in his house. Nay, more, they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him, whereof the worst part was their own coldness and desertion (<a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14, 19</a>). Finally, to establish the renewed friendship, every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold. The money given is said to have been a <span class="accented">kesitah</span>  which means probably a certain weight of silver, though whether a shekel or not is uncertain.

Ear-rings were commonly worn in the East by men as well as women, as appears from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures.

It in no way pledged God to compensate worldly adversity by worldly prosperity in the case of any other sufferer; and certainly the general law seems to be that such earthly compensation is withheld. But, in combination with the instinct which demands that retributive justice shall prevail universally, it may be taken as an earnest of God's ultimate dealings with men, and a sure indication that, if not on earth, at least in the future state; each man shall receive "the deeds done in the body," according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. <span class="cmt_word">For he had</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and he had</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses</span>.

Beauty has always been highly valued in the East; and Job would feel himself highly favoured in having three beautiful daughters. It may have been on account of their great beauty that their father gave them inheritance among their brethren, which was certainly an unusual practice in the East.

It has been concluded from this statement, combined with that at the close of ver. 10, that Job was exactly seventy years of age when his calamities fell upon him ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 1087, note); but this is really only a conjecture, since the statement that "God added to all that had been Job's to the double," does not naturally apply to anything but his property. We may, however, fairly allow that (as Professor Lee says) he "could scarcely have been less than seventy" when his afflictions came, having then a family of ten children, who were all grown up (<a href="../../par/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>). In this case, the whole duration of his life would have been 210 years, or a little more, which cannot be regarded as incredible by those who accept the ages of the patriarchs, from Peleg to Jacob, as respectively 239, 230, 148, 205, 175, 180, and 147 years. <span class="cmt_word">And saw his sons, and his sons' sons</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his descendants - grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

The wise physician cannot heal himself. Instead of receiving thy chastisement in a right spirit, thou "faintest," or rather, "thou art angry, art offended" - as the same verb is also to be translated in the second verse. There is a tone of sarcasm about these remarks, which implies a certain hardness and want of real affection in the speaker, and which cannot but have been perceived by Job, and have detracted from the force of what Eliphaz urged. If one has to rebuke a friend, it should be done with great delicacy. Our "precious balms" should not be allowed to "break his head" (<a href="../../par/psalms/141-6.htm">Psalm 141:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled</span>; or, <span class="accented">perplexed -</span> "confounded."

If he does not, what is the natural inference? Surely, that he is not so confident of his innocence as he professes to be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">Remember, I pray thee, who <i>ever</i> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?</span> The heart of the matter is now approached. Job is called upon to "remember" the long-established moral axiom, that only evil-doing brings down upon men calamities, and that therefore, where calamities fall, them must be  precedent wickedness. If he does not admit this, he-is challenged to bring forward examples, or even a single example, of suffering innocence. If he does admit it, he is left to apply the axiom to himself<span class="cmt_word">. Or where were the righteous cut off?</span> Was the example of "righteous Abel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>) unknown to Eliphaz? And had he really never seen that noblest of all sights, the good man struggling with adversity? One would imagine it impossible to attain old age, in the world wherein we live, without becoming convinced by our own observation that good and evil, prosperity and adversity, are not distributed in this life according to moral desert; but a preconceived notion of what ought to have been seems here, as elsewhere so often in the field of speculation, to have blinded men to the actual facts of the case, and driven them to invent explanations of the facts, which militated against their theories, of the most absurdly artificial character. To account for the sufferings of the righteous, the explanation of "secret sins" was introduced, and it was argued that, where affliction seemed to fall on the good man, his goodness was not real goodness - it was a counterfeit, a sham - the fabric of moral excellence, so fair to view, was honeycombed by secret vices, to which the seemingly good man was a prey. Of course, if the afflictions wore abnormal, extraordinary, then the secret sins must be of a most heinous and horrible kind to deserve such a terrible retribution. This is what Eliphaz hints to be the solution in Job's case. God has seen his secret sins - he has "set them in the light of his countenance" (<a href="../../par/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>)  - and is punishing them openly. Job's duty is to humble himself before God, to confess, repent, and amend. Then, and then only, may he hope that God will remove his hand, and put an end to his sufferings

The words translated "iniquity" and "wickedness" express in the original both moral and physical evil. Men sew the one and reap the other. Eliphaz extends this general rule into a universal law, or, at any rate, declares that he has never known an exception. He has not, therefore, been grieved and perplexed, like David, by "seeing the ungodly in such prosperity" (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>). He would seem not to have been a man of very keen observation.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken</span>. Wicked men, especially oppressors, are often compared to lions in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>, etc.). The meaning of Eliphaz is that, within his experience, all classes of wicked men, young, or old, or middle-aged, weak or strong, have received in this life the reward of their iniquity. However fiercely they might roar, however greedily they might devour, their roaring has died away, their teeth have been broken in their mouths, vengeance has lighted on them in some shape or other; they have paid the penalty of their transgressions. Five classes of lions seem to be spoken of in this and the following verses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the whelp (ver. 11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the half-grown lion, just able to make its voice heard; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the young full-grown lion (<span class="accented">cephir</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the lion in full maturity (<span class="accented">ariyeh</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the old lion which is growing decrepit (<span class="accented">laish</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To these is joined (ver. 11) <span class="accented">labi</span>, "the lioness." Lions are still frequent in the Mesopotamian region ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp 39, 221), though no longer found in Palestine, nor in Arabia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey</span>. The human counterpart of the "old lion" is the oppressor whose strength and cunning begin to fail him, who can no longer carry things with a high hand, enforce his will on men by bluster and throats, or even set traps for them so skilfully that they blindly walk into them. Political charlatans whose role is played out, bullies whose nerve is beginning to fail, cardsharpers whose manual dexterity has de-sorted them, come under this category. And the stout lion's whelps; rather, the <span class="accented">whelps of the lioness</span> (<span class="accented">see the</span> Revised Version). Are scattered abroad. Even the seed of ill-doers suffer. They are involved in their parents' punishment (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Eliphaz darkly hints that Job may have been among the class of oppressors, or (at any rate) of transgressors, and that the untimely fate of his children may have been the consequence of his evil-doings.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-21.</span> - Eliphaz proceeds to narrate a spiritual experience of a very strange and striking character. It was night, and he had fallen asleep, when suddenly he was, or seemed to himself to be, awake. A horrible fear came over him, and all his limbs trembled and quaked. Then a spirit seemed to pass before his face, while every hair on his body rose up and stiffened with horror. It did not simply pass across him, but stood still, in a formless form, which he could see but not clearly distinguish. There was a deep hush. Then out of the silence there seemed to come a voice, a whisper, which articulated solemn words. "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man," etc.? Supernatural visitations were vouchsafed by God to many besides the chosen people - to Laban, when he pursued Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), to Abimelech (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>), to the Pharaoh of the time of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>), to his chief butler (<a href="../../par/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9-11</a>), and his chief baker (<a href="../../par/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16, 17</a>), to Balaam the son of Beer (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5-10, 16-24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-9, 15-24</a>), to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-35</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1-32</a>), and others. The method and manner of these visitations raise a multitude of questions which it is impossible to answer, but are convincing evidence to all who believe Scripture to be true, that communications can pass between the spiritual and material worlds of a strange and mysterious character. The communication to Eliphaz may have been a mere vision, impressed upon his mind in sleep, or it may have been actually brought to him by a spiritual messenger, whom he could dimly see, and whose voice he was privileged to hear. Modern pseudo-science pronounces such seeing and hearing to be impossible. But poets are often clearer-sighted than scientists, and Shakespeare utters a pregnant truth when he says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br />Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now a thing was secretly brought to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a word</span> (or, <span class="accented">a message</span>) <span class="accented">was brought to me stealthily. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And mine ear received a little thereof</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">whisper</span> thereof (see the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="../../par/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, and the Vulgate, which gives <span class="accented">susurrus</span>). As the form of the vision was not distinct to Eliphaz's eyes (ver. 16), so neither were the words which were uttered distinct to his ears. He thinks himself able, however, to give the sense of them (see vers. 17-21).

It has been argued (Rosenmuller) that "a breath of air," and not "a spirit," is intended; but, in that ease, how are we to understand the expressions in the following verse: "it stood still," "the form thereof," "an image"? A breath of air, the very essence of which is to be in motion, cannot stand still, nor has it any "form," "appearance," or "imago." Granted that the Hebrew <span class="accented">ruakh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;</span>) may mean - like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">spiritus -</span> either an actual spirit, or a breath, a wind, it follows that, in every place where it occurs, we must judge by the context which is meant. Here certainly the context points to an actual living spirit, as what Eliphaz intended. Whether a spirit really appeared to him is a separate question. The whole may have been a vision; but certainly the impression left on Eliphaz was that he had had a communication from the spirit-world. <span class="cmt_word">The hair of my flesh stood up</span>. Not the hair of his head only, but every hair on his whole body, stiffened, bristled, and rose up on end in horror (see the comment on ver. 14).

Even in them God does not trust implicitly, since he knows that they are frail and fallible, liable to err, etc., only kept from sin by his own sustaining and assisting grace (setup. <a href="../../par/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, where Eliphaz expresses the same belief in his own person). <span class="cmt_word">And his angels he charged with folly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">chargeth.</span> The <span class="accented">exact</span> meaning of the word translated "folly" is uncertain, since the word does not occur elsewhere.

The teaching clearly is that the angels are not perfect - the highest angelic excellence falls infinitely short of God's perfectness. Even angels, therefore, would be incompetent judges of God's doings.

The anticipation is in remarkable accordance with the ultimate event (<a href="../../par/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>), and shows that Eliphaz, if not a prophet in the higher sense, is at least a sagacious interpreter of God's ways with men, and can very happily forecast the future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">call now</span>; <span class="accented">is there any that will answer thee?</span> What aid, that is, wilt thou invoke, if thou turnest away from God, and reproachest him?

The question, "To <span class="accented">which</span> wilt thou turn?" seems to imply that there was already in Job's time some knowledge  of individual members of the angelic host, such as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, etc., though we have no mention of any names of angels in Scripture until the time of Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>). That invocation of angels was an actual practice in Job's age is, however, scarcely proved by this passage.

For "wrath" and "envy "others suggest "vexaation" and "impatience" (Lee), or "vexation" and "jealousy" (Revised Version). The connection of thought seems to be, "For thou art quite foolish enough to let thy vexation and impatience prompt thee to such a course, which could only lead to thy destruction." Eliphaz is quite sure that trust in any other beside God, and appeal to any other against God, is utter folly, sinful infatuation, and must lead to the ruin of whoever indulges in it. Thus the invocation of angels receives no countenance from him, but the contrary.

It might seem to prosper: the foolish man might seem to be taking root; but Eliphaz was not deceived by appearances - he saw through them, he knew that there was a curse upon the man's house, and so pronounced it accursed. And the ruin which he had foreseen, it is implied, followed. But suddenly; rather, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, <span class="accented">without hesitation.</span> I cursed his habitation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pronounced it accursed, declared that the curse of God rested upon it?"

The sins of the fathers arc visited upon the children. Eliphaz makes covert allusion to the death of Job's children (<a href="../../par/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>).

To the dweller in the parched regions of South-Western Asia rain is the greatest of all blessings, and seems the greatest, of all  marvels. When for months and months together the sun has blazed all day long out of a cloudless sky, when the heaven that is over his head has been brass, and the earth that is under him iron (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>), a great despair comes upon him, and that it should ever rain again seems almost an impossibility. Where is the rain to come from? From that cruel, glaring sky, which has pursued him with its hostility week after week, and month after month? Or from that parched earth in which, as it seems, no atom of moisture is left? When God at length gives rain, he scarcely believes his eyes. What? The blessed moisture is once more descending from the sky, and watering the earth, and quickening what seemed dead, and turning the desert into a garden! All Eastern poetry is full of the praises of rain, of its blessedness, of its marvellousness, and of its quickening power. Very naturally Eliphaz, in speaking of God's marvellous works of mercy, mentions rain first, as, within his experience, one of the chief<span class="cmt_word">.

God's physical blessings are intended to subserve moral ends. He gives his rain, both the former and the latter, to raise up men from despair, to enable them to see in him a God of mercy as well as a God of vengeance; and with the same object, after withholding it from us for a while, he pours into our parched hearts the dew of his Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">That those which mourn may be exalted to safety</span>; or, "raised to safety" (Lee).

Some suppose Eliphaz to insinuate here that Job's apparent wisdom has not been true wisdom, but cunning or craft, and that therefore God has brought it to nought. But to us it rather seems that he enunciates a.general sentiment, and a true one. He is giving examples of the "marvellous things" which God does (ver. 9), and naturally enumerates among them his victories over the craft and cunning of his adversaries (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a><span class="cmt_word">).

He recognizes the fact that the Almighty "maintains the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor" (<a href="../../par/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a>), that he is "a Refuge for the oppressed, a Refuge in times of trouble" (<a href="../../par/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And iniquity stoppeth her mouth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>). Either "the oppressors themselves are struck dumb, recognizing the fact that God is against them;" or "those who perversely question God's ways are struck dumb, seeing his retributive justice." If we understand the passage in the latter sense, we may see in it a reproof of Job's murmurs against his treatment by God (<a href="../../par/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, happy <i>is</i> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth!</span> This "opens," as Professor Lee observes, "a new view of the subject." Hitherto Eliphaz has regarded afflictions as simply punitive. Now it occurs to him that they are sometimes chastisements. The difference is that punishment has regard only to the past, to the breach of the moral law committed, and the retribution which has to follow it. Chastisement looks to the future. It aims at producing an effect in the mind of the person chastised, at benefiting him, and raising him in the scale of moral being. In this point of view afflictions are blessings (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). Recognizing this, Eliphaz suddenly bursts out with the acknowledgment, "Happy is  the man [or, 'blessings on the man'] whom God correcteth!" (Comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>). He suggests to Job the idea that his sufferings are not punishments, but chastisements - that they may be but for a time. Let him receive them in a proper spirit; let him humble himself under them, and they may work altogether for his good, his latter end may surpass his early promise<span class="cmt_word">. Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty</span>. Words quoted by the authors of Proverbs (Proverb s3:11), and of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>), and well deserving to be laid up in the recollection of all faithful souls. They remind us that God's chastenings are blessings or the contrary, as we <span class="accented">make them.</span> Accepted humbly, they improve men, exalt the moral character, purge it of its dross, and bring it nearer to the perfection at which God would have us aim (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). Rejected, chafed against, received with discontent and murmurings, they injure us, cause our characters to deteriorate, sink us instead of raising us in the moral scale. Job was now undergoing the ordeal - with what result remained to be determined.

Little by little Eliphaz passes from a general description of the blessedness of those faithful ones who "despise not the chastening of the Almighty" (ver. 17) to a series of allusions which seem specially to touch Job's case. Without claiming prophetical inspiration, he ventures to promise him in the future "the exact reverse of all that he had experienced" in the past - "a safe home, flocks untouched, a happy and prosperous family, a peaceful old age" (Cook). The promises may have sounded in Job's ears as "a mockery" (ibid.); but it is creditable to the sagacity of Eliphaz that he ventured to make them. And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. The ordinary symbols for multitudinous-ness - the sand of the sea, and the stars of heaven - are here superseded by an entirely new one, "the grass of the earth." Undoubtedly it is equally appropriate, and perhaps more natural in a pastoral community.

He is, however, quite confident that he has arrived at a true conclusion, and expects Job to accept it and act upon it. <span class="cmt_word">Hear it, and know thou it for thy good</span>; literally, for <span class="accented">thyself.</span> Make the knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which I have communicated to thee, thine own. Professor Lee observes, "Them is nothing in all this savouring of any asperity, as far as I can see, beyond the anxieties of true friendship. The sentiments delivered from ver. 17 to the end of the chapter are not only most excellent in themselves, but perfectly applicable to Job's case; and were, in the event, made good in every respect. It is true, we have not much sympathy expressed for Job's bereavements and afflictions. And, in this respect, Eliphaz was, no doubt, to blame" ('Book of the Patriarch Job' p. 216). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/job/6.htm"><title>Job 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/job/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/job/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/job/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../job/5.htm" title="Job 5">&#9668;</a> Job 6 <a href="../job/7.htm" title="Job 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-1.htm">Job 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">But Job answered and said,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Job answered and said, Oh that my grief were throughly weighed!</span> rather, <span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">anger</span>, or <span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">vexation</span> - the same word as that used by Eliphaz when reproaching Job, in <a href="../../par/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>. Job wishes that, before men blame him, they would calmly weigh the force of his feelings and expressions against the weight of the calamity which oppresses him. His words may seem too strong and too violent; but are they more than a just counterpoise to the extreme character of his afflictions? The weighing of words and thoughts was an essential element in the Egyptian conception of the judgment, where Thoth held the balance, and in the one scale were placed the merits of the deceased, in the other the image of Ma, or Truth, and his fate was determined by the side to which the balance inclined ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. 125; Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 5. p. 252). <span class="cmt_word">And my calamity laid in the balances together</span>.

So Shakespeare speaks of "the slings and <span class="accented">arrows</span> el outrageous fortune" for calamities generally. The metaphor is a very common one (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-13.htm">Lamentations 3:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poison whereof</span>.

This is his apology for his vehemence; he is well-nigh distraught. He adds<span class="cmt_word">, The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me</span>. Besides actual pains and sufferings, he is assailed by fears. God's terrors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the other evils that he has at his disposal, are drawn up against him, as it were, in battle array, and still further agitate and distract his soul.

Job means to say that his own complainings are as natural and instinctive as these of animals (On the species of wild asses known to Job, see the comment on Job 39:5.) <span class="cmt_word">Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span> The lowing of the ox, like the braying of the wild ass, is a complaint - a sign of distress and discomfort. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <i>any</i> taste in the white of an egg?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?</span> or, <span class="accented">that which is insipid.</span> Many critics suppose that in this and the following verse Job reproaches Eliphaz with the insipidity of his remarks, and declares that his soul refuses to touch such loathsome food. Others regard him as still speaking in his own defence, and justifying his expressions of disgust by the nauseous character of the food which had been put before him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the treatment which he has received. Either explanation produces good sense; but perhaps the former is the more natural<span class="cmt_word">. Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span> So our Revisers; and so Dillmann and Canon Cook. Professor Lee suggests "the whey of cheese" for "the white of an egg;" others, "the juice of purslaine." We have certainly no other evidence that eggs were eaten in primitive times.

The doubt remains whether Job is speaking of the arguments of Eliphaz, or of the series of afflictions which have befallen him. Either explanation is possible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <i>me</i> the thing that I long for!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that I might have my request!</span> Here the second point is taken up. Eliphaz has threatened Job with death, representing it as the last and most terrible of punishments (<a href="../../par/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>). Job's reply is that there is nothing he desires so much as death. His primary wish would have been never to have been born (<a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-10</a>); next to that, he would have desired an early death - the earlier the more acceptable (<a href="../../par/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-19</a>). As both these have been denied him, what he now desires, and earnestly asks for, is a speedy demise. It is not as yet clear what he thinks death to be, or whether he has any hope beyond the grave. Putting aside all such considerations, he here simply balances death against such a life as he now leads, and must expect to lead, since his disease is incurable, and decides in favour of death. It is not only his desire, but his "request" to God, that death may come to him quickly. <span class="cmt_word">And that God would grant me the thing that I long for</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my expectation</span> or <span class="accented">wish</span>. The idea of taking his own life does not seem to have occurred to Job, as it would to a Greek (Plato, 'Phaedo,' &sect; 16) or a Roman (Pithy, 'Epist.,' 1:12). He is too genuine a child of nature, too simple and unsophisticated, for such a thought to occur, and, if it occurred, would be too religious to entertain it for a moment. Like Aristotle, he would feel the act to be cowardly (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 5, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>); and, like Plato (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), he would view it as rebellion against the will of God.

First, the comfort that the end was come, and that he would be spared further sufferings; and further, the still greater comfort that he had endured to the end, and not. denied nor renounced his trust in religion and in all the "words of the Holy One." Professor Lee sees here "the recognition of a future life, expressed in words as plain and obvious as possible" ('Book of the Patriarch Job,' p. 223). But to us it seems that, if the idea is present at all, it is covered up, latent; only so far implied as it may be said to be implied in all willingness to die, since it may be argued that even the most wretched life possible would be preferred by any man to no life at all, and so that when men are content to die they <span class="accented">must</span> be expecting, whether consciously or not, a life beyond the grave, and be sustained by that expectation<span class="cmt_word">.

For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for I have not denied</span> or <span class="accented">renounced.</span> It would be a part of Job's satisfaction in dying that he had not let go his integrity. Rather he had held it fast, and not renounced or abandoned his trust in God and in religion. "The words of the Holy One are the commands of God, however made known to man" (Canon Cook).

Job rejects this suggestion. His strength is brought too low; it is not conceivable that he should be restored, he cannot entertain any such hope. <span class="cmt_word">And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</span> rather, <span class="accented">that</span> I <span class="accented">should stretch out my spirit.</span> Job cannot look forward to such an "end" as Eliphaz prophesies for him; therefore he cannot bring himself to wait on with patience.

Job feels that, instead of having exceptional strength of constitution to enable him to bear up against his exhausting malady, he is absolutely without strength. All his vital power is used up. There is no help in him. <span class="cmt_word">And is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> rather, I<span class="accented">s not soundness driven quite from me? Tushiyah</span> seems to mean here "strength of constitution" - that internal soundness which resists the inroads of disease, and sometimes triumphs over the most serious maladies.

Job begins here the third head of his reply to Eliphaz, in which he attacks him and his companions. The first duty of a comforter  is to compassionate his afflicted friend, to condole with him, and show his sympathy with his sufferings. This is what every one looks for and expects as a matter of course. But Job has looked in vain. He has received no pity, no sympathy. Nothing has been offered him but arguments. And what arguments! How do they touch the point? How are they anything more than a venting of the speaker's own self-righteousness?

"a winter torrent" - a "wady," to use the modern Arab expression. These watercourses are characteristic of Palestine and the adjacent regions. "During the winter months," says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, "they are often foaming rivers; but in the hot summer, when they would be of priceless value, their dry bed is generally the road from one point to another. The water rushes over the sheets of rock as it would from the roof of a house, and converging, as it descends, into minor streams in the higher wadies, these sweep on to a common channel in some central valley, and, thus united, swell in an incredibly short time into a deep, troubled, roaring flood, which fills the whole bottom of the wady with an irresistible torrent...  The streams from Lebanon, and also from the high mountains of the Hauran. send down great floods of dark and troubled waters in spring, when the ice and snow of their summits are melted; but they dry up under the heat of summer, and the track of the torrent, with its chaos of boulders, stones, and gravel, seems as if it had not known a stream for ages. So Job's friends had in former times seemed as if they would be true to him for ever; but their friendship had vanished, like the rush of the torrent that had passed away" ('The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 123-125). <span class="cmt_word">And as the stream of brooks they pass away</span>; or, <span class="accented">the channel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wady itself. Canon Cook well says on this, "The simile is remarkably complete. When little needed, the torrent overflows; when needed, it disappears. In winter it does not fertilize; in summer it is dried up. Nor is it merely useless; it deceives, alluring the traveller by the appearance of verdure, promising refreshment, and giving none."

Job seems to have seen wadys where, in the winter-time, the water was actually frozen into hard black ice.

But nothing is commoner than for caravans short of water to go out of their way in order to reach a wady, where they expect to be able to replenish their water-skins. If they are disappointed, if the wady is dry, they may be brought into great straits, and may even possibly perish.

Here Job penetrates to the motive which had produced the conduct of his friends. They had come with good intentions, meaning to comfort and console him; but when they came, and saw what a wreck he was, how utterly "broken up" and ruined, they began to be afraid of showing too much friendliness. They thought him an object of the Divine vengeance, and feared lest, if they showed him sympathy, they might involve themselves in his punishment.

At the close, he admits his sinfulness (ver. 20), but asks impatiently why God does not pardon it instead of visiting it with such extreme vengeance (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is there not a warfare</span> (or, <span class="accented">a time of service</span>) <span class="accented">to man upon earth?</span> Has not each man a certain work appointed for him to do, and a certain limited time assigned him within which to do it?

The slavery of Job's time was probably not unlike that of captive races in Egypt, so graphically portrayed in the early chapters of Exodus. The captive, working from morning to night at exhausting labour, would long intensely for the night to arrive, when his toil would come to an end. The inference is not drawn, but clearly is - so Job may be excused if he longs for death, now that he has reached old age, and that the work of his life is manifestly ended<span class="cmt_word">. And as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for his wages.</span> The word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>) has the two meanings of "work" and "the wages of work" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>).

"Months of vanity" are "months of which he can make no use " - "months which  are no good to him." It has been concluded from this theft some considerable time had elapsed since Job was stricken by his disease. But he is perhaps looking to the future as much as to the past, anticipating a long, lingering illness. Elephantiasis is a disease which often lasts for years<span class="cmt_word">. And wearisome nights are appointed to me</span>. To one stretched on a bed of sickness, the night is always more wearisome than the day. It has no changes, nothing to mark its flight. It seems almost interminable. In elephantiasis, however, it is a special feature of the disease that the sufferings of the patient are greatest at night. "In <span class="accented">elephantiasis ansesthetica</span>" says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, "a sense of dulness and heat pervades the surface, and there are sensations of tingling and prickling, and of burning heat. While the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, sometimes of the vertebral column. <span class="accented">These pains are greatest at night</span>; <span class="accented">they prevent sleep</span>, <span class="accented">and give rise to restlessness and frightful dreams"</span> (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817).

This is rather poetical than strictly medical. The special characteristic of elephantiasis, from which it derives its name, is that the integument, or outer skin, is "formed into large masses or folds, with a rugose condition of the surface, not unlike the appearance of an elephant's leg" (Quain, vol. 1. p. 431). But the swellings do not contain clods of dust<span class="cmt_word">. My skin is broken, and become loathsome</span>. A common feature in elephantiasis is the development and gradual growth of solid papules or tubercles in the skin. These enlarge as the disease progresses, and after a time soften and break up; an nicer is then formed, and a discharge follows of a virulent and loathsome character. Presently the discharge steps; the ulcer heals; but only to break out again in another place. In the Revised Version the passage is rendered, <span class="accented">My skin closeth up</span>, <span class="accented">and breaketh afresh.</span>

Another protest against the hopes flint Eliphaz has held out (see the comment on ver. 6; and setup, <a href="../../par/job/9-25.htm">Job 9:25</a>).

In mountainous countries one sees clouds clinging to a mountain-side, which do not float away, but gradually shrink, and at last wholly disappear.

So he that goeth down to the grave; rather, to <span class="accented">Sheol</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the lower world, the abode of the departed. What exactly was Job's idea of this world it is impossible to say, or whether it involved the continued separate identity of individual souls and their continued consciousness. In Isaiah's conception both seem certainly to have been involved (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-18</a>), and perhaps in Jacob's (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>); but Job s creed on the subject can only be conjectured. It is certain, however, that both the Egyptians and the early Babylonians held the continuance after death of individual souls, their separate existence, and their consciousness (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 317-319; and 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 62-65). Shall come up no  more. The Egyptian belief was that the soul would ultimately return to the body from which death separated it, and rein-habit it. But this belief was certainly not general among the nations of antiquity.

Job has already pointed out that nature teaches the animals to complain when they suffer (<a href="../../par/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>). Why, then, should not he? Complaint is not necessarily murmuring; it is sometimes merely expostulation, which God allows (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>, etc.).

Am I as wild and uncontrollable as the ocean, as fierce and savage as a crocodile or other monster of the deep? Do I not possess reason and conscience, by which I might be directed and guided? Why, then, am I treated as if I were without them? The sea must be watched, lest it break in upon the land; in Egypt there had been many such breaches, as the configuration of the coast, with its narrow belts of sand and its vast lagoons, shows; and crocodiles must be watched, lest they destroy human life; but is there any need that I should be watched, restrained, coerced, hedged in on every side (<a href="../../par/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>)? Am I so dangerous? Surely not. Some liberty therefore might have been safely given to me, instead of this irksome restraint. <span class="cmt_word">That thou settest a watch over me;</span> or, a <span class="accented">guard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a set of physical impediments, which leave me no freedom of action.

Sometimes, notwithstanding his many "wearisome nights" (ver. 5), Job would entertain a hope of a few hours' rest and tranquillity, as, wearied and exhausted, he sought his couch, and laid himself down upon it, but only to be disappointed. <span class="cmt_word">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions</span>. Unpleasant dreams are said to be a symptom, or at any rate a frequent concomitant, of elephantiasis; but Job seems to speak of something worse than these. Horrible visions came upon him, which he believed to be sent directly from the Almighty, and which effectually disturbed his rest, making night hideous. Probably this was one of the modes in which Satan was permitted to try and test him.

Suicide, as already observed, seems never even to have occurred to the thoughts of Job (see the comment on Job 6:8). <span class="cmt_word">And death rather than my life</span>; literally, <span class="accented">rather than my bones.</span> Death, that is, would be preferable to such a life as he leads, which is that of a living skeleton.

"cease to trouble thyself about me;" for I am sufficiently reduced to nothingness - my life is mere vanity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a></div><div class="verse">What <i>is</i> man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?</span> or, <span class="accented">make so much of</span> him - regard him as of such great importance (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>). It seems, at first sight, an exalted idea of God to regard him as too lofty, too great, to be really concerned about so mean a creature, so poor a being, as man. Hence, among the Greeks, the Epicureans maintained that God paid no attention at all to this world, or to anything that happened in it, but dwelt secure and tranquil in the empyrean, with nothing to disturb, displease, or vex him. And the holy men of old sometimes fell into this same phase of thought, and expressed surprise and wonder that God, who dwelt on high, should "humble himself to consider the things in heaven and earth." "Lord," says David, or whoever was the author of the hundred and forty-fourth psalm, "what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man k like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away" (<a href="../../par/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3, 4</a>). But all, except Epicureans, agree that God does,  in fact, so concern himself, and a little reflection is enough to show us that the opposite view, instead of exalting, really degrades God. To bring conscious, sentient beings into the world - beings capable of the intensest happiness or misery, and then to leave them wholly to themselves, to have no further care or thought of them, would be the part, not of a grand, glorious, and adorable Being, but of one destitute of any claim to our admiration. <span class="cmt_word">And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</span> This strong expression is not used of God elsewhere. But it well expresses the <span class="accented">extreme</span> tenderness and consideration that God has for man, and the deep love from which that tenderness and consideration spring. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>that</i> thou shouldest visit him every morning, <i>and</i> try him every moment?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that thou shouldset visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span> Our <span class="accented">whole</span> life is a probation, not merely particular parts of it. God "tries us <span class="accented">every moment</span>" if not with afflictions, then with blessings; if not with pains, then with pleasures. He is with us all the day long, and all our life long, equally in his mercies and in his chastisements. But Job was probably thinking only of the latter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou not depart from me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Wilt thou not look away from me?</span> (see the Revised Version). Job does not go so far as to ask that God should "depart from" him. He knows, doubtless, that <span class="accented">that</span> would be the extreme of calamity. But he would have God sometimes turn away his eyes from him, and not always regard him so intently. There is something of the same tone of complaint in the psalmist's utterance., "Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and <span class="accented">spiest out all my</span> ways" (<a href="../../par/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>, Prayer-book Version). <span class="cmt_word">Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</span> Even, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for the shortest space of time passible.

This is not so much a confession as a concession, equivalent to "Granting that I have sinned," or, "Suppose that I have sinned." In that case, <span class="cmt_word">What shall I do unto thee?</span> or, <span class="accented">What can I do for thee?</span> How is it in my power to do anything? <span class="cmt_word">Can I undo the past?</span> Or can I make compensation in the future?

Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee?</span> "A mark" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>) is either "a butt," "a target for arrows," or else "an obstacle," "a stumbling-block," which God, by repeated blows, is removing out of his way. The latter meaning is preferred by Schultens and Professor Lee; the former by Rosenmuller and our Revisers. <span class="cmt_word">So that I am a burden to myself</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a></div><div class="verse">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?</span> Job feels that, if he has sinned, which he is ready to admit as possible, though he has certainly no deep conviction of sin (<a href="../../par/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24, 29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>), at any rate he has not sinned greatly, heinously; and therefore he cannot understand why he has not been forgiven. The idea that the Almighty cannot forgive sin except upon conditions, is unknown to him. Believing God to be a God of mercy, he regards him also, just as Nehemiah did, as a "God of pardons" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>) - a belief which seems to have been instinctive with men of all nations. And it appears to him unaccountable that pardon has not been extended to himself. Like his "comforters." he makes the mistake of supposing that all his afflictions have been penal, are signs of God's displeasure, and intended to crush and destroy him. He has not woke up to the difference between God's punishments and his chastisements. Apparently, he does not know that "whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth," or that men are "made perfect through sufferings" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For now shall I sleep in the dust.</span> Now it is too late for pardon to avail anything. Death is nigh at hand. The final blow must soon be struck. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be</span>. The idea seems to be - God will relent at last; he will seek to alleviate my sufferings; he will search for me diligently - but I shall have ceased to be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/job/8.htm"><title>Job 8 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/job/8.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/job/8.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/job/8-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../job/7.htm" title="Job 7">&#9668;</a> Job 8 <a href="../job/9.htm" title="Job 9">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/8-1.htm">Job 8:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said</span>.

We may suppose him to have been younger than Eliphaz and older than Zophar. He does little more than repeat the arguments of Eliphaz, stating them, however, more bluntly, and with less of tact and consideration. The chief novelties of his discourse are an appeal to the teaching of past ages (vers 8-10), and the employment of new and forcible metaphors (vers. 11-19).

But he had never gone so far as to make the direct charge, and a true friend would have shrunk from taxing him with an impiety, witch could only be deduced from his speech by way of inference. It is our duty to put the best construction that we can on our friends' words, no less than upon their actions<span class="cmt_word">. Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</span> "Justice" is not altogether the same thing with "judgment." Judgment is the act, justice the principle which underlies or ought to underlie the act. It is, of course, impossible for God to pervert either. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do <span class="accented">right</span>?" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).

There is a tacit assumption that Job has not had recourse to God, has not pleaded his cause with him or taken him into counsel; whereas all the evidence was the other way. Both when the first batch of calamities was reported to him (<a href="../../par/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14-19</a>), and when the stroke of disease came (<a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>), Job cast his care on God, fell back on him, submitted himself to him unreservedly. "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord," he said in the one case; in the other, "What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"

Job had asserted this, not in so many words, but substantially (<a href="../../par/job/6-29.htm">Job 6:29, 30</a>). We have God's testimony that it was true (<a href="../../par/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>); not, of course, in the sense that he was absolutely free from sin, but in that qualified sense in which "just," and "righteous," and "pure," and "holy" can be properly used of men. Bildad implies, without boldly asserting it, that he does not believe Job to deserve the epithets, either absolutely or in a qualified sense. If he were so, Surely now he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) would awake for thee. This is a common anthropomorphism (see <a href="../../par/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>).

Here, once mere, Bildad does but follow in the steps of Eliphaz (see <a href="../../par/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-26</a>), prophesying smooth things, as be had done. It is difficult to believe that either comforter put any faith in the prospect which he held out, or imagined that Job would really be restored to prosperity. Rather there is a covert sarcasm in their words. If thou weft indeed so free from guilt as thou claimest to be, then thou wouldst be confident of a happy issue out of thy afflictions. If thou art not confident of such an issue, it is because thou art conscious of guilt.

Bildad implies that the records of these remote times have been, in some way or other, preserved, either in writings or by oral tradition. Writing was certainly known in Egypt and Babylonia from a time anterior to Abraham, and to the Hittites at a date not very much later. Books of advice and instruction embodied in proverbs, or moral precepts, were among the earliest, in Egypt certainly. See the "Instructions of Amen-em-hat." in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. if. pp. 11-16, and the 'Proverbs of Aphobis,' published by the Revelation Dunbar Heath. Bildad's speech is thought to indicate "special familiarity with Egypt."

It is generally admitted that the "papyrus" is meant "a plant of the <span class="accented">Cyperaceae</span> or sedge family, which was formerly common in Egypt" (Hooker, in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1019). The chief peculiarity of the papyrus is its triangular stem, which rises to the height of six or seven, sometimes even of thirteen or fourteen, feet, and terminates in a bunch of thread-like flowering branchlets. The pith of these stems was the material of which the ancient Egyptians made their paper. The papyrus is a water-plant, and needs an abundant supply, but would often spring up out of any small pool which the Nile left as it retired, and, when the water failed from the peel, would rapidly wither away. A fine papyrus plant was on view, with other water-plants, in the circular greenhouse in Kew Gardens, towards the end of the season of 1890. Can the flag grow without water "The flag" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) seems to be the ordinary sedge, or marah-plant. Like the papyrus, it would often spring up in all its greenness from a pool or pond left by the retiring river, and then in a few days, when the water was dried up, would wither away. Both images represent the prosperity of the wicked, and were probably proverbial.

It grows and flourishes in a rich greenness up to a certain point; no one touches it; but the water fails from the root, and it fades, collapses, and is gone. It withereth before any other herb. The ground may be all green around it with ordinary grass and other herbs, since they only need a little moisture - the water-plant will collapse unless it has its full supply.

So, that is, do those proceed on their way by whom God has been forgotten,  They spring up in apparent strength and lusty force; they flourish for a brief space; then, untouched by man's hand, they suddenly fade, fall, and disappear, before the mass of their contemporaries.

Here the second metaphor begins to come in. The ungodly, who has built up around him a house, and a body of dependants and friends, is like a spider which has spun itself a magnificent web, and thinks to find a defense in it. The moment it is put to the proof it breaks in sunder;" its delicate tracery is shattered; its fabric goes to nought. Job's house had gone to nought before his person was smitten, and, though it had once been so strong, in the hour of trial had lent him no support at all. <span class="cmt_word">And whose trust shall be a spider's web</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a spider's house.</span> All the trust of the ungodly, in whatever it consists, shall be as fragile, as frail, as unsubstantial, as the filmy structure that a spider spins with such ears and skill, but which a wind, or a wasp, or an inconsiderate movement of its own may shatter to bits.

A spider's web, once damaged, rapidly goes to pieces. It cannot be patched up. To "lean upon it" is to put its structure to a test which it is unable to bear. It cannot "stand" or "endure." The case is the same with all the supports of the ungodly.

Bildad here introduces a third and more elaborate simile. The hypocrite, or ungodly man (ver. 13), is as a gourd (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-6.htm">Jonah 4:6</a>), or other rapidly growing plant, which shoots forth at sunrise with a wealth of greenery, spreading itself over a whole garden, and even sending forth its sprays and tendrils beyond it (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>) - lovely to look at, and full, apparently, of life and vigour. And his branch shooteth forth in his garden; rather, <span class="accented">over his garden</span>, <span class="accented">or beyond his</span>, <span class="accented">garden</span>.

This passage is very obscure The word <span class="accented">gal</span>, translated heap, means sometimes a spring or stream of water (<a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>); and many of the best Hebraists regard it as having that meaning here (Buxtorf, Lee, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). In this case we have to regard the rapidly growing plant as having its roots wrapped about the perennial spring, which was a not uncommon, and always a much-desired, feature of an Eastern garden. Thus nourished, it naturally increased and spread itself, and "was green before the sun." May we suppose that it "saw the house of stones," because the spring which nourished it gushed forth from the native rock so that its roots were in contact with both? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a></div><div class="verse">If he destroy him from his place, then <i>it</i> shall deny him, <i>saying</i>, I have not seen thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he destroy him from his place</span>; or, <span class="accented">if he be destroyed.</span> The verb seems to be best taken as impersonal. If he be destroyed in any way, suddenly or gradually, by a Divine stroke, or by human agency, or by the comparatively slow process of nature, in any case the result is one, the flourishing plant is clean swept away, and the place of it knows it no more. Bildad's words are very dramatic and expressive. Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. The place shall be ashamed of having ever nurtured anything so vile, and shall declare that it never held such a growth.

Bitterly ironical - This is what his rapid and rampant greenery comes to; this is how his triumphant career ends! Utter destruction, disappearance, obliteration! And out of the earth shall others grow. The destruction leaves room for something better to follow - a sounder, healthier, and less short-lived growth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect <i>man</i>, neither will he help the evil doers:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man</span>. Bildad winds up with words of apparent trust in, and good will towards, Job. God is absolutely just, and will neither forsake the righteous man nor uphold the wicked one. If Job is, as he says, true to God, upright, and (humanly speaking) "perfect," then he has only to go on trusting God; God will not leave him "till he fill his mouth with laughing, and his lips with rejoicing" (ver 21); then "they that irate him shall be clothed with shame, and their dwelling-place shall come to nought' (ver. 22); but if, as we feel instinctively that Bildad believes, Job is not "perfect," but "an evil-doer," then he must expect no relief, no lull in his sufferings; he is obnoxious to all the threatenings which have formed the bulk of Bildad's discourse (vers. 8-20) - be may look to being cut off, like the rush and the flag (vers. 11, 12), crushed like the spider's web (ver. 14), destroyed, and forgotten, like the rapidly growing gourd (Vers. 16-19); he must look for no help from God (ver. 20); but must be contented to pass away and make room for men of a better stamp (ver. 19). Neither will he help the evil-doers; literally, <span class="accented">neither will he grasp the hand of</span>  <span class="accented">evil-doers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though he may support them for a while, he will not maintain them firmly and constantly.

This is very elliptical. The full phrase would be, "God will not cast away a perfect man; therefore, if thou be such, he will not cast away thee, till he fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing," or "with shouting for joy."

Man cannot absolutely justify himself before God. It is in vain to attempt to do so. The contest is too unequal. On the one side perfect wisdom and absolute strength (ver. 4); on the other, weakness, imperfection, ignorance. guilt (vers. 17-20). And no "daysman," or umpire, between them; no third party to hold the balance even, and preside authoritatively over the controversy, and see that justice is done (vers. 33-35). Were it otherwise, Job would not shrink from the controversy; but he thinks it ill arguing with omnipotent power. What he seems to lack is the absolute conviction expressed by Abraham in the emphatic words'" Shall not the Judge of all the earth <span class="accented">do</span> <span class="accented">right?"</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Job answered and said, I know it is so of a truth</span>.

Bradford looks upon the murderer as he mounts the scaffold, and says, "But for the grace of God, there goes John Bradford!" Job has a similar conviction, that in the sight of God, righteousness, such as it is, shrinks away into insignificance, and is as nothing, cannot anyhow be relied upon. Such must be the attitude before God of every human soul that is not puffed up with pride or utterly insensate and sunk in apathy.

Earthquakes are common in all the countries adjoining Syria and Palestine, and must always have been among the most striking manifestations of God's power.

Josephus speaks of one which desolated Judaea in the reign of Herod the Great, and destroyed ten thousand people ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:5. &sect; 2). There was another in 1181, which was felt over the whole of the Hauran, and did great damage. A still more violent convulsion occurred in 1837, when the area affected extended five hundred miles from north to south, and from eighty to a hundred miles east and west. Tiberias and Safed were overthrown. The earth gaped in various places, and closed again. Fearful oscillations were felt. The hot springs of Tiberias mounted up to a temperature that ordinary thermometers could not mark, and the loss of life was considerable (see the account given by Dr. Cunningham Geikie, in 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 2. pp. 317, 318). The phrases used by Job are, of course, poetical. Earthquakes do not literally "remove" mountains, nor "overturn" them. They produce fissures, elevations, depressions, and the like; but they rarely much alter local features or the general configuration of a district.

On the whole, it seems most probable that '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> (<a href="../../par/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>), designates "the Great Bear," called by the Arabs <span class="accented">Nahsh</span> while <span class="accented">Kesil</span> is the name of the constellation of Orion, and <span class="accented">Kimah of</span> that of the Pleiades. The word '<span class="accented">Ash</span> means "a litter," and may be compared with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and our own" Charles's Wain," both of them names given to the Great Bear, from a fancied resemblance of its form to that of a vehicle. <span class="accented">Kesil</span> means "an insolent, rich man" (Lee); and is often translated by "fool" in the Book of <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-20.htm">Proverbs 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a>, etc. It seems to have been an <span class="accented">epitheton usitatum</span> of Nimrod, who, according to Oriental tradition, made war upon the gods, and was bound in the sky for his impiety - the constellation being thenceforth called "the Giant" (<span class="accented">Gibbor</span>)' or "the insolent one' (Kesil), and later by the Greeks "Orion" (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span>' <a href="../../par/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>). <span class="accented">Kimah</span> undoubtedly designates "the Pleiades."

The Chaldeans called the zodiacal constellations "mansions of the sun" and "of the moon" ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 575); but these do not seem to be here intended. Rather Job has in his mind those immense spaces of the sky which lie behind his southern horizon; how far extending, he knows not. Though the circumnavigation of Africa was not effected until about r c. 600, yet it is not improbable that he may have derived from travellers or merchants some knowledge of the Southern hemisphere.

An almost exact repetition of the words of Eliphaz in <a href="../../par/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>. The repetition may have been conscious or unconscious. Job may have meant to say, "My view of God embraces all that you can tell me of him, and goes further;" or he may simply have used words concerning the Divine unsearch-ableness which were common in the mouths of religious men in his time (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>; and infra, <a href="../../par/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>).

Near as God is to us, close as he comes to us, we cannot directly see him, or feel him, or perceive his presence. We know it by faith, we may feel it in our inmost spirits; but there is no manifestation of it to our senses. A sharp line divides the visible and invisible worlds; and this line, if it is ever crossed, is very rarely crossed. Job possibly reflects upon the pretension of Eliphaz to have had a physical consciousness of the visitation of a spirit (<a href="../../par/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>), and asserts, with a tinge of sarcasm, that it is otherwise with him - the spirit-worm passes him by, and he receives no light, no illumination, no miraculous direction from it. <span class="cmt_word">He passeth on also</span>. The same verb is used by Eliphaz (<a href="../../par/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15</a>) in speaking of his spiritual visitation. <span class="cmt_word">But I perceive him not</span>. Eliphaz perceived the presence of the spirit (<a href="../../par/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>) and heard its voice (<a href="../../par/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16-21</a>). Job seems to mean that he is not so favoured.

The expression is much stronger than that used in <a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. Job seems to be smarting under the recollection of all that he has lost, and takes an aggrieved tone. <span class="cmt_word">Who can hinder him?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; Romans 19:20). <span class="cmt_word">Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span> To have to do with such an irresistible Being, alone in his might, would indeed be terrible if, while absolutely powerful, unchecked and uncontrolled from without, he were not also absolutely good, and therefore controlled and checked by a law from within. This, however, Job, in his present mood, does not seem clearly to see. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a></div><div class="verse"><i>If</i> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him</span>. There is no "if" in the original; and the passage is best taken categorically: "God does not withdraw his anger;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the anger which he feels against those who resist him. "The helpers of Rahab do stoop [or, 'are prostrate'] under him." Rahab in this passage, and also in <a href="../../par/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, as well us in <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, seems to be used as the proper name of some great power of evil Such a power was recognized in the mythology of Egypt, under the names of Set (or Typhon) and of Apophia, the great serpent, continually represented as pierced by Horus (Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 257; 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 395). In the earlier Aryan myths there is a similar personification of evil in Vitre, called Dasiya, "the Destroyer," and at perpetual enmity with Indra and Agni ('Religions of the Ancient World,' p. 114). The Babylonians and Assyrians had a tradition of a great "war in heaven" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 133-136). carried on by seven spirits, who were finally reduced to subjection. All these seem to be distorted reminiscences of that great conflict, whereof the only trustworthy account is the one contained in the Revelation of St. John, "There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels" - the "helpers" of the present passage - "and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven" (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 8</a>). Job, it seems, had inherited one of such traditions, one in which the power of evil was known as Rahab, "the Proud One;" and he means here to say that God not only holds men in subjection, but also beings much more powerful than man, as Rahab and his helpers, who had rebelled and made war on God, and been east down from heaven, and were now prostrate under God's feet.

The sentiment can scarcely be justified, since it breathes something of a contamacious spirit. But this only shows that Job was not yet" made perfect through sufferings" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). And multiplieth my wounds without cause. A further assertion, not of absolute sinlessness, but of comparative innocence - of the belief that he had done nothing to deserve such a terrible punishment as he is suffering (comp. <a href="../../par/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24, 29</a>).

Since he could not <span class="accented">wholly</span> justify himself. "All men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Job has already admitted the utterance of "rash words" (<a href="../../par/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>), and, at least hypothetically, that he "has sinned" (<a href="../../par/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>), and needs "pardon" for his "transgression" (Job 7:24). Job, if he tried to "justify himself," would have to acknowledge such shortcomings, such imperfections, such sins - at any rate, of infirmity - as would make his attempted justification a real self-condemnation. <span class="cmt_word">If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even were</span> I <span class="accented">perfect</span> <span class="accented">it</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my mouth) <span class="accented">would prove me perverse</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> supposing I were actually perfect, and tried to prove it, my speech would be so hesitating and confused, that I should only seem to be perverse.

The original is very elliptical and very obscure. The words run, <span class="accented">I perfect  - I know not myself - I abhor my life</span> which some explain as meaning, "Were I perfect, I should not know it myself; I despise my life under such conditions" (Stanley Loathes); others, "I am perfect" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> guiltless of any plain offence), "but do not understand myself, and care not what becomes of me" (Canon Cook); others again, "Were I perfect, should I not know myself, and, knowing myself, despise my own life?" (Professor Lee). The Septuagint gives us no help, as it plainly follows a different reading. Probably our present text is a corrupt one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> one <i>thing</i>, therefore I said <i>it</i>, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is one thing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the matter is one</span> or <span class="accented">it is all one</span>. There is no difference, that is, between the case of the righteous and the wicked; all are alike sinful in God's sight, all equally "concluded under sin" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>), and all consequently obnoxious to punishment at his hands (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a>). In a certain sense the statement is true, and corresponds with the argument of <a href="../../par/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-3</a>; but no account is taken here of God's gracious forgiveness of sin, much less of the general scheme of redemption, or the compensation for earthly sufferings in an eternity of happiness, on which the hope of the Christian rests. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I said it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">therefore I say</span> with the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked</span>. <span class="accented">As</span> <span class="accented">far as this</span> world is concerned, it is undoubtedly true that calamities fall alike upon the just and upon the unjust.

Nor can it even be said that the wicked in this world suffer more than the good (comp. 1 Oct. 1529). Their sufferings are more the natural consequence of their actions, but do not seem to exceed in amount or severity the sufferings of the good. But this only shows that there must be a future life to redress the apparent injustice of the present one, and set the balance right.

If one of these be let loose upon a land, and slay, as it always does slay, <span class="accented">indifferently</span> the good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty, what is God's attitude? Does he interpose to save the righteous? By no means. He looks on passively, indifferently. Job even goes further, and says, with an audacity that borders on irreverence, if it does not even overstep the border, <span class="cmt_word">He will laugh at the trial of the innocent</span>. St. Jerome says, "There is nothing in the whole book harsher than this." It may, perhaps, be excused, partly as rhetorical, partly as needful for  the full expansion of Job's argument. But it is a fearful utterance. (Professor Lee's attempt to explain the whole passage differently is scarcely a successful one.)

As a further proof of God's indifference to the sufferings of the innocent, Job adduces the fact that, in the high places of the earth, are mostly set wicked persons, who oppress and persecute the righteous. This has probably been true, in the East at any rate, at all times. <span class="cmt_word">He covereth the faces of the judges thereof</span>. God covers up the eyes of those who have to judge between the oppressors and the oppressed, so that they pervert judgment, and side with the oppressors. He does this, since he permits it to be done. Corrupt judges are among the perennial curses of the East. <span class="cmt_word">If not, where</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">who is he?</span> rather, <span class="accented">If it be not he</span> <span class="accented">who then is it?</span> (see the Revised Version).

Life slips away so fast that before it is well begun, it is ended. Job compares it to the swift passage of the trained runner, or messenger, who carried despatches for kings and other great personages in the olden times (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10, 14</a>). Herodotus says of the trained runners employed by the Persians, "Nothing mortal travels so fast as these Persian messengers" (Herod., 8:98). There is abundant evidence of the employment of such persons in ancient Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">They flee away, they see no good</span>. It seems to Job that his prosperity (<a href="../../par/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2-5</a>) was only for a moment. He scarcely could look on it before it was gone.

Plant.,' 4:9; Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:56; 13:11; Luean, ' Pharsalis,' 4:36, etc.). They were long, light canoes, formed generally of the papyrus plant, and propelled either by a single paddle or by a punting-pole. They were fiat-bottomed and broad, like punts, with a stem and stern rising considerably above the level of the water (see the authofs 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 507, 508). Isaiah speaks of them as "vessels of bulrushes," in which "swift messengers" were sent by the nations peopling the banks of the Nile (<a href="../../par/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1, 2</a>). The Euphrates boats described by Herodotus (1:194) were of an entirely different construction, and cannot be here intended. They consisted of a framework of wood, which was covered with skins, and then coated with bitumen, and resembled the Welsh "coracles<span class="cmt_word">." As the eagle that hasteth to the prey</span>; or, <span class="accented">as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey</span> (Revised Version). Job's observation presents to him three types of swiftness - the trained runner upon the earth, the swift ships upon the waters, and the hungry eagle in the air. It seems to him that his life passes away as swiftly as any of these.

The whole mass of his sufferings seems to rise up against him, and make even momentary forgetfulness impossible. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">will leave off my heaviness</span>; or, <span class="accented">my black looks. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And comfort myself</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>, where the same verb is rendered "recover strength"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a></div><div class="verse">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afraid of all my sorrows</span> (see the comment on ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent</span>. The worst of all Job's sorrows is the sense of alienation from God, which his unexampled sufferings have wrought in him. Though unconscious of having deserved them, he still, not unnaturally, looks upon them as marks of God s displeasure, proofs that God does not regard him as innocent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-29.htm">Job 9:29</a></div><div class="verse"><i>If</i> I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I be wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I am</span> <span class="accented">wicked</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I am accounted so - I am already condemned. The extreme afflictions raider which I suffer indicate that God has passed sentence upon me, and awarded me my punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Why then labour I in vain?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Why argue? Why seek to justify myself, since no result is likely to follow? Nothing that I can say will alter God's foregone conclusion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I wash myself with snow-water</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>). If I should succeed in purging myself of all guilt, and establishing, so far as words can do it, my spotless innocence even then what advantage should I gain? Snow-water does not really cleanse what is defiled better than any other water, but a lively fancy might suppose it to do so. Job indulges in this fancy, but then checks himself, and adds a prosaic alternative. And make my hands never so clean; rather, and <span class="accented">make my hands clean with lye.</span> Lye, or potash, is the principal and most essential ingredient in soap. and the readiest and best detergent. If Job cleanses himself to the very utmost, "Cut bone?" he asks. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-31.htm">Job 9:31</a></div><div class="verse">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch</span>. Yet would God with ease undo his work, show his purity to be impure, his  righteousness to be filthy rags, and thus, as it were, replunge him in the mire and clay from which he had sought to free himself, and hold him forth a more loathsome wretch than ever. <span class="cmt_word">And mine own clothes shall abhor me</span>. So loathsome would he be that his very garments, stained and fouled by his disease, would shrink away from him and hate to touch him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>he is</i> not a man, as I <i>am, that</i> I should answer him, <i>and</i> we should come together in judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; and we should come together in judgment</span> (comp. vers. 2-14). On one of two conditions only, Job thinks, could the contest be even between himself and God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If God, divesting himself of all his Divine attributes, became man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some thirdsman could be found, some umpire or arbitrator, to preside over the contest, and decide it. Neither condition, however, was (he thought) possible; and therefore no satisfactory judgment could take place. Recent commentators observe that the Christian scheme, which Job could not anticipate, provides almost a literal fulfilment of both conditions, since the God who is to judge us is "true Man," and is also a Mediator, or "Thirds-man," between us and the offended Father, with authority to make the final decision, 'the Father having committed all judgment unto the Son "(<a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), and" given him authority to execute judgment also'" for the very reason that he is "the Son of man" (<a href="../../par/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a></div><div class="verse">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, <i>that</i> might lay his hand upon us both.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us</span>; literally '<span class="accented">judge</span> <span class="accented">or arbitrator</span> called a "daysman," since he appoints the day on which the arbitration is to come off. The LXX. renders by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "mediator." That might lay his hand upon us bosh. Moderate between us, that is; keep us both in cheek; assert an authority to which we must both submit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a></div><div class="verse">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him take his rod away from me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who would remove his rod from</span> me. Job means that it would be a part of the duty of the "daysman" to see that God's rod was removed from him before he was called upon to plead, so that he might not labour under so erect a disadvantage as his sufferings would place him under. And let not his fear terrify me; or, <span class="accented">and would not suffer his fear to terrify me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> would not allow Job to be placed under the disadvantage, either of pain or of fear, either of actual or prospective suffering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/9-35.htm">Job 9:35</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Then</i> would I speak, and not fear him; but <i>it is</i> not so with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then would I speak, and not fear him</span>. Job has imagined conditions which are impossible (though they may, to some extent, be compensated for in the actual scheme of man's redemption); and says that, under the circumstances which he has imagined, he would not fear to justify himself before God. The assertion is over-daring, and, as Schultens says, shows the patriarch to be no longer master of himself, but carried away by the force of overwrought feeling. But it is not so with me; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I am not in such a position as to enter on my justification." I am weighted by my sufferings, and also by my fears. I therefore decline the contest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../job/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Job 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../job/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Job 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
