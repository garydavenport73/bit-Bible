It was the most sacred month of the Jewish year, commencing with a blowing of trumpets and a holy convocation on the first day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), which was followed on the tenth day by the solemn day of atonement (ibid. ver. 27; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29-34</a>), and on the fifteenth day by the feast of tabernacles or "ingathering," one of the three great annual festivals, which lasted to the twenty-second day. Zerubbabel and Joshua determined to risk a disturbance rather than defer the restoration of the altar beyond the commencement of this sacred month. <span class="cmt_word">The people gathered themselves together.</span> The people were bound to attend the feast of tabernacles (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-16</a>); but something more than this seems to be intended. The restoration of the altar and the re-establishment of the daily sacrifice having been announced, there was a general influx of the country Israelites into Jerusalem to witness the proceedings. <span class="cmt_word">As one man</span>. Very emphatic (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as <i>it is</i> written in the law of Moses the man of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshua the son of Jozadak.</span> The position of Jeshua, both here and in vers. 8, 9, sufficiently marks him as the high priest, though Ezra does not give him the title. Haggai, however (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, 14; 2:2), and Zechariah (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a>) distinctly assign him the office. His father, Jozadak, or Josedech, was the son of Seraiah, high priest at the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-14.htm">1 Chronicles 6:14</a>). The name Jeshua is a mere variant of Joshua, and so corresponds to Jesus, of whom Jeshua may be regarded as a type. <span class="cmt_word">His brethren</span> <span class="cmt_word">the priests.</span> As being all of them equally descended from Aaron, the priests were "brethren." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel</span>.

It was an express command of God to the Israelites that sacrifice should be offered only at Jerusalem in the place which he should appoint. <span class="cmt_word">Moses the man of God.</span> That is, "the Prophet;" but the phrase is emphatic, and characteristic of Ezra (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear <i>was</i> upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, <i>even</i> burnt offerings morning and evening.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They set the altar upon his bases.</span> They built the new altar upon the foundations of the old one, making it exactly conform to them. This was done, no doubt, to indicate that the religion which the exiles brought back from Babylon was in every respect identical with that which they had possessed before they were carried thither. Many moderns hold the contrary; but it has not yet been proved that the sojourn at Babylon modified the religious ideas of the Jews in any important particular. <span class="cmt_word">For fear was upon them.</span> Or, "<span class="accented">though</span> fear was upon them." Notwithstanding their fear of the surrounding nations, they set up the altar. We must remember that their neighbours were not Persians, but descendants of various idolatrous nations  -  Hamathites, Babylonians, Susianians, Elamites, Cuthaeans, etc. - bitterly opposed to anything like a pure spiritual religion (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9, 10</a>). Though the exiles had permission from Cyrus to raise up not only their altar, but their temple, it was not at all certain that his nominal subjects would passively submit. It was as if a modern Turkish Sultan should decree the erection of a Christian altar and a grand Christian cathedral at Kerbela or Bussorah, towards the verge of his empire. There would be great danger in acting on such a decree. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offerings morning and evening</span>. So the law required (see <a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3, 4</a>). CELEBRATION OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES (ver. 4). Emboldened by their successful restoration of the altar of burnt sacrifice, Zerubbabel and Jeshua allowed the people to gather themselves together and celebrate the autumnal festival, though they can scarcely have made it on this occasion a "feast of ingathering." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <i>it is</i> written, and <i>offered</i> the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written</span>. According to the mode of celebration prescribed in the law; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for seven consecutive days, from the fifteenth to the twenty-second of Tisri, with burnt offerings every day, and a holy convocation on the first day and the last, and a "dwelling in tents" during the whole period (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-31.htm">Leviticus 23:31-42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom</span>. The offerings for each day of the festival are carefully laid down in <a href="../../par/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13-38</a>. We must understand that all the particulars there enjoined were carefully observed. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DAILY SACRIFICE, THE SET FEASTS, AND THE OFFERING OF FREE-WILL OFFERINGS (vers. 5, 6). Having set up the altar, and celebrated the particular festival which the revolving year happened to have brought round, and which it would have been wrong to neglect, the exiles re-established permanently three things: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The daily sacrifice; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The celebration of the new moons and other regular feasts; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The practice of allowing the people to bring offerings whenever they pleased, to be offered on the great altar by the priest or priests in attendance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first of these was for atonement; the second for public thanksgiving and acknowledgment of God's mercies; the third for private devotion, the payment of vows, and the like. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">And afterward <i>offered</i> the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The continual burnt</span> <span class="cmt_word">offering.</span> This is beyond a doubt the daily morning and evening sacrifice, called "the continual burnt offering" in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-6</a>. The clause is not modified by the succeeding words, which are additional, not exegetical, and which should not be translated, as in the A. V., <span class="cmt_word">both of the new moons,</span> but, "<span class="accented">and those</span> of the new moons." The returned exiles kept henceforth regularly both the daily morning and evening sacrifice, and also that appointed for the new moons (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>), and those appointed for the other "set feasts,"such as the passover and the feast of Pentecost. <span class="cmt_word">And of every one that willingly</span> <span class="cmt_word">offered.</span> Nor was this all. The practice was resumed of sacrificing on the great altar at any time any free-will offerings that individual Israelites might bring (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1, 2, 3</a>, etc.). Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6). PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE (ver. 7). When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the "decree of Cyrus" (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>) as those to be employed in the construction of the second. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-6.htm">Ezra 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not <i>yet</i> laid.</div><div class="comm">

Consequently, among those who returned there were many masons and carpenters. These were now set to work by Zerubbabel, and received their wages in money. <span class="cmt_word">And meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre.</span> The Phoenicians, on the other hand, received their wages in kind. As Phoenicia was a narrow strip of country, and grew but little corn, it had always to depend mainly for its supplies of food on its neighbours, and generally drew the greater part from Palestine (see <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Hiram had furnished materials to Solomon for the first temple on condition of receiving wheat, barley, wine, and oil (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>). Zerubbabel made a similar arrangement at the present time with the Tyrians and Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">To bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa.</span> Having cut the timber in the mountains, the Phoenicians conveyed it to the coast, perhaps sometimes letting it pass down the rivers, and, collecting it on the coast into large rafts or "flotes" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>), took these by sea to the roadstead of Joppa (Jaffa). Hence it was conveyed by land a distance of thirty-five miles to Jerusalem. Lebanon cedar was in great request in the East, and appears to have been cut and carried off both by the Egyptians and the Assyrians. The forests must in the ancient times have been far more extensive than at present. <span class="cmt_word">According to the grant that they had of Cyrus.</span> A special grant of Phoenician timber, made by Cyrus, seems to be intended. Though Cyrus had not conquered Phoenicia ('Herod.,' 3:34), he might regard his conquest of Babylon as involving the submission of what had for some time been a Babylonian dependency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:8-13 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&sect; 3. REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND OPPOSITION MADE TO IT. LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE AND CEREMONIAL ON THE OCCASION (vers. 8-13). Seven months were occupied with preparations. The winter was past, and the spring had arrived. It was the second month, Zif, the month of "blossom," corresponding to our May - the same month in which Solomon had laid the foundation of the first temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>) - when Zerubbabel judged that the time had come for commencing the foundation of the second. The correspondence of the month was no doubt intentional, like the correspondence of the foundations of the altar (ver. 3), and was to mark that all was to be as before, that nothing was to be wantonly changed. Zerubbabel and Jeshua presided; but to Zerubbabel is assigned the chief part in the work. "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house" are the words of God himself to Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>). It was arranged that the work should commence with a religious ceremonial, natural piety here suggesting what was not recorded of the "first house," though it may have occurred and not have been put on record. The ceremonial consisted chiefly of praise, and was accompanied with sacred music, according to the pattern set by David and Solomon in their sacred processions and ceremonies (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>, etc.). Their special parts in it were assigned beforehand to the priests, the Levites, and the people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the second year.</span> In  <span class="date">B.C. 537</span>, the second year of Cyrus in Babylon, which was also the second year <span class="cmt_word">of their coming</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after their coming) <span class="cmt_word">to the</span> (ruined) <span class="cmt_word">house of God</span> (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a>), began <span class="cmt_word">Zerubbabel,</span> and the others, <span class="cmt_word">and appointed the Levites.</span> Small as the number of the Levites who returned with Zerubbabel was, to them especially was intrusted <span class="cmt_word">the work of the house of the Lord,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the superintendence of the workmen employed to rebuild it (see ver. 9).

The musical service of Zerubbabel fell short of the "ordinance of David," since it comprised neither psalteries nor harps, which were an essential part of David's system. Apparently, the musical skill of the Levites had declined under the depressing circumstances of the captivity (see <a href="../../par/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>).

But religious shouting is less common.

The difference was perhaps not so much in the dimensions (see note on Ezra 6:3) as in the size and quality of the foundation-stones (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>), the excellence of the masonry, and the like.
