Herodotus says that it was built by Deioces, the first Median king, occupied the centre of the town, and was defended by seven circles of walls, one inside the other (1:98). Polybius states that the building covered an area 1420 yards in circumference, and consisted of a number of halls and cloistered courts, supported by wooden pillars, of cypress or of cedar, both of which were coated with a plating of gold or silver, and supported roofs sloped at an angle, consisting of silver plates instead of the customary tiling (5:27, 10). This grannd building was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and also of Cyrus and Cambyses. Darius built himself still more magnificent residences at Susa and Persepolis; but both he and the later Achaemenian monarchs continued to use the Median palace as a summer residence, and it maintained its celebrity till the close of the empire (see Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:19). <span class="cmt_word">A roll</span>. According to Ctesias ('Died. Sic.,' 2:32), the Persians employed parchment or vellum for the material of their records, not baked clay, like the Assyrians and Babylonians, or paper, like the Egyptians. Parchment would be a suitable material for rolls, and no doubt was anciently used chiefly in that shape. <span class="cmt_word">Therein was a record thus written.</span> The decree would no doubt be written, primarily, in <span class="cmt_word">the</span> Persian language and the Persian cuneiform character; but it may have been accompanied by a Chaldaean transcript, of which Ezra may have obtained a copy. Public documents were commonly set forth by the Persians in more than one language (see 'Herod.,' 4:87; and comp. the 'Inscriptions,' <span class="accented">passim</span>, which are almost universally either bilingual or trilingual). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">In the first year of Cyrus the king <i>the same</i> Cyrus the king made a decree <i>concerning</i> the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, <i>and</i> the breadth thereof threescore cubits;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifice.</span> Or, "the place where they may offer sacrifice." It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. <span class="cmt_word">Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid</span>. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, <span class="accented">Thy foundation shall be laid"</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid "supportingly," or "strongly," that so the house may the longer continue. <span class="cmt_word">The height thereof threescore cubits.</span> Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); but one-third <span class="accented">more</span> than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breadth thereof threescore cubits.</span> This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, <span class="accented">with the side chambers</span>, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple.

The two wings of the temple of Solomon were undoubtedly three storeys high (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). But it is perhaps doubtful whether the word <span class="accented">nidbak</span> ever means "storey." Most commentators suppose three <span class="accented">courses</span> of stone, and then a course of timber, repeated from foundation to summit; but there is no known example of such a mode of building. The <span class="cmt_word">expences</span> were to be <span class="cmt_word">given</span> <span class="cmt_word">out of the king's</span> <span class="cmt_word">house,</span> defrayed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the royal revenue; but either this intention of Cyrus was not carried out, or it was understood to apply only to the materials. Large sums were subscribed by the Jews themselves towards the building (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>), and large payments were made by them to the persons employed upon the work (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>).

The Persian satraps had to collect from their provinces a certain fixed sum as the royal tribute, and had to remit this sum annually to the court.

The only other ordinary sacrificial animal was "a kid of the goats<span class="cmt_word">."

The Jews have always maintained the practice of praying for the civil ruler of any country in which they have had their abode. Jeremiah s exhortation to "seek the peace" of Babylon (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>) was understood in this way, and the tradition has been handed down even to the present day. Under monarchs so favour-able to them as the Achaemenian Persians the duty would certainly not have been neglected. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">of his sons.</span> In Persia "the royal house" was the special object of regard. Individual kings must die, but the house would go on (see the speech of Artemisia to Xerxes in 'Herod.,' 8:102; and compare the references to the "gods of the royal house" in the Inscriptions). Kings took special care of their sons. Thus Cyrus sent Cambyses back to Persia when he was about to attack the Massagetae ('Herod.,' 1:208), and Xerxes gave several of his sons into the charge of Artemisia, to convey them by ship to Asia, while he himself took the long and perilous journey by land (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:103).

Hence the severity of the punishment threatened. The punishment has been explained as crucifixion, impalement, and "whipping at a post;" but there seems to be no real doubt that crucifixion is intended. Great criminals were almost always crucified by the Persians (see Brisson, 'De Regno Persarum,' 2. pp. 327-329; and comp. 'Behist.

Still the knowledge that the angels of God were interesting themselves in the restoration of the temple (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9-21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>, etc.), and the many promises that God would "comfort Zion," and "choose Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>), and that the temple should assuredly be brought to completion (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>), helped no doubt to strengthen the hands of Zerubbabel, and to keep up the zeal of the people<span class="cmt_word">. According to the commandment of Cyrus</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia</span>. The commandments of Cyrus and of Darius have been set forth by the writer (see <a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3-5, 7</a>); but nothing has been said as yet of any commandment given by any Artaxerxes to "build" or "finish" the house. On the contrary, the only Arta-xerxes mentioned has been declared to have expressly forbidden the work to proceed (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7-22</a>). The Artaxerxes of that place, moreover, reigned between Cyrus and Darius, whereas this Artaxerxes should, by the position of his name, be one of the successors of Darius. It has been suggested that Xerxes is intended, and that he may have been associated with his father during the building of the temple. But as Xerxes was the son of Atossa, whom Darius did not marry until he had ascended the throne (Herod., 3:88), he cannot have been more than five years old when the temple was finished. Nor was he ever associated on the throne by his father. Xerxes, therefore, cannot be meant. The next king to Xerxes, however, who really bore the name of Artaxerxes was a favourer of the Jews, and did give commandment to "beautify," and in that sense "finish," the house of the Lord (see <a href="../../par/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20, 27</a>). We must suppose, therefore, that he is the person intended. The objection that the name is not spelt the same, but has a <span class="accented">samech</span> in one place instead of a <span class="accented">schin</span>, is too minute to require consideration. The Persians themselves spelt the name of Artaxerxes in more ways than one (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. p. 348). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>).

We may assume that some of every tribe had returned with Zerubbabel, and that consequently it was possible to regard the re-established people as "Israel" (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-20.htm">Nehemiah 11:20</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>); though, since the great majority were Jews, they were more commonly spoken of as "Judah" (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1, 6, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>, etc.). Zerubbabel, desirous of emphasising the nobler and grander view, made this solemn sin offering of twelve he-goats, one for each of the tribes. Ezra acted similarly when he brought the second colony (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-18.htm">Ezra 6:18</a></div><div class="verse">And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span> <span class="cmt_word">set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses.</span> The completion of the new temple was naturally followed by an arrangement of the ministers corresponding to that which had been originally made by David, and afterwards adopted by Solomon, for the service of the old temple (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6-23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-19</a>). This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-26</a>), and, so far, was <span class="cmt_word">according to the writing of the book of Moses.</span> But the "courses" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19-22</a>). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 726</span>, recorded in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, and that celebrated by Josiah in  <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>, recorded in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span> in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon</span> <span class="cmt_word">the fourteenth day of the first month.</span> The day fixed by the law of Moses (see <a href="../../par/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-20.htm">Ezra 6:20</a></div><div class="verse">For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them <i>were</i> pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The opening section of this verse is mistranslated. Ezra really makes a distinction between the priests and the Levites, the former of whom, he says, "purified themselves," while the latter "were all pure, as one man;" wherefore the latter killed the paschal lambs, not only for themselves and for the people, but also for their brethren the priests. It would seem that, as in Hezekiah's time, "the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-21.htm">Ezra 6:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as had</span> <span class="cmt_word">separated themselves unto them.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> such proselytes as had been made since the return from the captivity. We have perhaps a mention of some of these proselytes in the "Sherezer" and "Regem-melech" sent by the men of Bethel a short time before this to make inquiries of the priests at Jerusalem in respect of fasting (<a href="../../par/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>). These names are Assyrian, and not likely to have been given to persons born Jews. <span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">the filthiness of the heathen</span> means "from their moral defilements" (see ch. 9:11). It is always to be borne in mind that heathen idolatry was full of such impurities.

On the spiritual meaning of the feast, see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord had... turned</span> <span class="cmt_word">the heart of the king of Assyria</span>. It has been generally supposed that Darius is personally meant here, and surprise has been expressed at his being called "king of <span class="accented">Assyria."</span> That title is never elsewhere given in Scripture to a king of Persia. Perhaps the writer's real intention in this place is to express in a general way the thankfulness of the Jews that God had turned, the hearts of their civil rulers, whether Assyrians, Babylonians, or Persians, from hostility to friendship, having replaced the bitter enmity of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar by the hearty good-will of Cyrus and Darius. On this view, Assyria would represent merely the great power of Western Asia, and "the king" would not be Darius personally, but the lord of Western Asia in a more general way, who by God's goodness had become the permanent friend of Israel instead of her oppressor and enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
