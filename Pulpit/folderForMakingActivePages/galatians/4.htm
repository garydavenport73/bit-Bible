A form of expression usual with the apostle when introducing a new statement designed either to explain or elucidate something before said (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>, according to the Received Text; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>.

It is intended apparently to quicken attention: "Now I wish to say this." In the present case the apostle designs to throw further light upon the position taken in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, that God's people, while under the Law, were under a bondage from which they have now been emancipated. Compare the somewhat similar process of illustration adopted in <a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2-4</a>. In both passages it is not a logical demonstration that is put forward, but an illustratively analogous case in human experience. A metaphor, though not strictly an argument, yet frequently helps the reader to an intuitive perception of the justness of the position laid down. <span class="cmt_word">That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">so long as the heir is a child</span>, <span class="accented">he differeth nothing from a bondservant</span>, <span class="accented">though he is lord of all.</span> The article before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, heir, is the class article, as before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, mediator (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-20.htm">Galatians 3:20</a>) - "an heir." In the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the apostle evidently has in view one who as yet is in his nonage - as in English law phrase, "an infant." In Roman law language, <span class="accented">infans</span> is a child under seven, the period of minority reaching to twenty-five. In Attic Greek, the correlate to one registered amongst "men" was a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. It does not appear that the apostle means to use a technical legal expression. He contrasts <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems used only in the sense of your differing from another to your advantage, so that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are things that are more excellent. "Lord," "proprietor;" the title to the property inheres in him, though he is not yet fit to handle it.

These speeches also show that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was entrusted with the handling of the property of his ward. Yet, as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> more especially denotes one entrusted with the management of property, it should seem that St. Paul uses the former term with more especial reference to the guardian's control over the <span class="accented">person</span> of his ward. The ward has to do what the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, guardian, thinks proper, with no power of ordering his actions according to his own will; while, on the other hand, the youth is not able to appropriate or apply any of his property further than as the "steward" thinks right; between the two he is bound hand and foot to other people's control. The plural number of the two nouns indicates the rough and general  way in which the apostle means to sketch the case; speaking in a general way, one may describe a minor as subject to "guardians and stewards." <span class="cmt_word">Until the time appointed of the father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, properly an adjective, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being understood, is used very commonly to denote, either a determined period during which a thing is to be done or forborne, which is its most ordinary sense (see Reiske's 'Lexicon to Demosthenes'); or the further limit of such a period, whence Symmachus uses it to render the Hebrew word for "end" in <a href="../../par/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>; or, lastly, a specified time at which a certain thing was to take place, as, for example, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 7:04, 7, "When the (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) day appointed for the payment came." This last seems to be the meaning of the word here, though it admits of being taken in the second sense, as describing the limit of the child's period of nonage. The somewhat loosely constructed genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "of the father," may be compared either with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "taught of God" (<a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>), or, in a somewhat different application, "the chastening and admonition of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>). In reference to the whole case as stated by the apostle, it has been asked - Is the father to be conceived of as dead, or as only gone out of the country, or how? It is sufficient to reply that "the point of the comparison" - to use Bishop Lightfoot's words - "lies, not in the circum stances of the father, but of the son;" and, further, that to supplement the description which the apostle gives by additional particulars not relevant for the purpose of the comparison would only tend to cloud our view of its actual import. In fact, any image taken from earthly things to illustrate things spiritual will inevitably, if completely filled out, be found to be in some respects halting. Another inquiry has engaged the attention of commentators, as to how far the particular circumstance, that the period of nonage is made dependent upon the father's appoint meat, can be shown to agree with actual usage as it then obtained. It would seem that no positive proof has hitherto been alleged that such an hypothesis was in strict conformity with either Greek or Roman or Hebrew law. And hence some have had recourse to the precarious and far-fetched supposition that St. Paul founds his thesis on Galatian usage, arguing that such would have been in accordance with that purely arbitrary control which, according to Caesar ('Bell. Gall.,' 6:19), a paterfamilias exercised over wife and children among the kindred tribes in Gaul. The scruple, how ever, now referred to arises from supposing that we know more about the facts than we really do know. So far as has been shown, we cannot tell what was really the precise rule of procedure which, in the case described by the apostle, prevailed either in Judaea, or in Tarsus, or in Galatia; nor again from what region of actual experience St. Paul drew his illustration. We, therefore, have no possible right to say that the case which he supposes was not fairly supposable. On the contrary, when we reflect how open the apostle's mind was for taking note of facts about him, and how wide and varied his survey, we may safely rest assured that his supposed case was in reality framed in perfect accordance to the civil usage, to which the Galatians would understand him to refer. At the same time, it must be conceded that, amongst different modes of arranging a minor's case which actual usage permitted or may be imagined to have permitted, the apostle selected just that particular mode which would best suit his present immediate purpose.

The plural pronoun recites, not individuals, but the community viewed as a whole, having the now subsisting "us" as its present representatives. Individually, Christians in general now, and many of those who then when the apostle wrote belonged to the Church, never were in the state of nonage or bondage here referred to. It is, however, notwithstanding this, quite supposable that St. Paul's account of the history of the whole society is in some degree tinted by the recollection of his own personal experiences. <span class="cmt_word">When we were children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); that is, when we were in our nonage. The phrase is not meant to point to a state of immaturity in personal development, but simply to the period of our being withheld from the full possession of our inheritance. This is all that the course of thought now pursued requires; and we only create for ourselves superfluous embarrassment by carrying further the parallel between the figuring persons and the figured. The spiritual illumination enjoyed by the Christian Church, compared with that of the pre-Christian society, presents as great a contrast as that of a man's knowledge compared with a child's; but that is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">Were in bondage under the elements</span> (or, <span class="accented">rudiments</span>) <span class="accented">of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world</span>; or, <span class="accented">were under the rudiments of the world brought into bond-service.</span> This latter way of construing, separating <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> from the participle  <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> to connect it with the words which precede, is recommended by the parallel, which the words, "were under the rudiments of the world," then present to the words," is under guardians and stewards," in ver. 2; while the participle "brought into bond-service" reproduces the notion expressed by the words, "is no better than a bond-servant," of ver. 1. The participle "brought into bond-service," then, stands apart, in the same way as the participle "shut up "does in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>. This, however, is only a question of style; the substantial elements of thought remain the same in either way of construing. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> calls for a few remarks, founded upon the illustration of its use given by Schneider in his 'Greek Lexicon.' From the primary sense of "stakes placed in a row," for example, to fasten nets upon, the term was applied to the letters of the alphabet as placed in rows, and thence to the primary constituents of speech; then to the primary constituents of all objects in nature, as, for example, the four "elements" (see <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a> ); and to the "rudiments" or first "elements" of any branch of knowledge. It is in this last sense that it occurs in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, "What are the (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) rudiments (of the beginning, or) of the first principles of the oracles of God" (on which compare the passage from Galen quoted by Alford at the place). This must be the meaning of the word here; it recites the rudimental instruction of children, as  if the apostle had said "under the A, B, C, of the world." This is evidently intended to describe the ceremonial Law; for in ver. 5 the phrase, "those under the Law," recites the same persons as are here described as "under the rudiments of the world;" as again the "weak and beggarly rudiments," in ver. 9, are surely the same sort of" rudiments" as are illustrated in ver. 10 by the words, "Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years." Since the Law under which the people of God were placed was God's own ordinance, we must infer that, when it is here designated as "the A, B, C, of the world," the genitive can neither denote the origin of these rudiments nor yet any qualification of moral pravity, but only the qualification of imperfection and inferiority; that is, it denotes the ceremonial institution s of the Law as appertaining to this earthly material sphere of existence, as contrasted with a higher spiritual sphere. Thus "the A, B, C, of the world" is an expression as nearly as possible identical with that of "carnal ordinances" (literally, <span class="accented">ordinances of the flesh</span>), used to describe the external ceremonialism of the Law in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; which phrase, like the one before us, is used with a full recognition, in the word "ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), of the Law as of Divine appointment, while the genitive "of the flesh" marks its comparative imperfection. They were, as Conybeare paraphrases, "their childhood's elementary lessons of outward things." This designation of Levitical ceremonies as being an "A, B, C," or "rudiments, of the world," appears to have become a set phrase with the apostle, who uses it again twice in the Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>), where he appears, if we may judge from the context, to have in view a (perhaps mongrel) form of Jewish ceremonialism which, with circumcision (mentioned in ver. 11), conjoined other "ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) mentioned in vers. 14, 20, relating to meats and drinks and observance of times, illustrated in vers. 16, 21. This, he tells the Colossians, might have been all very well if they were still "living in the world" (ver. 20); but now they were risen with Christ! - with Christ, who had taken that "bond" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 14) out of the way; and therefore were called to care for higher things than such merely earthly ones as these. Some suppose that the apostle has reference to the religious ceremonialisms of the idolatrous Gentiles, as well as those of the Mosaic Law. These former ceremonialisms belonged, indeed, to "the world," both in the sense above pointed out and as tinged with the moral pravity characterizing the "present evil world" in general. But these cannot be here intended, forasmuch as it was not to such that God's people were by his ordinance subjected. The other rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> - "elements" - which the Authorized Version puts into the text, but the Revised Version into the margin, was probably selected in deference to the view of most of the Fathers, who, as Meyer observes, took the Greek word in its physical sense: Augustine referring it to the heathen worship of the heavenly bodies and the other cults of nature; Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Ambrose to the new moons and sabbaths of the Jews, viewed as determined by the motions of the sun and moon; Jerome, however, interpreting it <span class="accented">rudimenta discipliner.</span> On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>, both of our Versions have "rudiments" in the text and "elements" in the margin; in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>, "elements" only. "Brought into bend-service" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), namely, by the act of the supreme Father imposing upon us the yoke of his Law.

So <a href="../../par/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "When he was well-nigh forty years old;" literally," When there was being completed to him a time of forty years" (comp. also <a href="../../par/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-57.htm">Luke 1:57</a>). The substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) "completion" occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>, "Dispensation of the completion of the times." The apostle might apparently have written <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "But when the term was completed;" but he prefers to express it in this particular form, as colouring the idea with a certain pathos of solemn joy at the arrival of a time so long expected, so fraught with blessing (compare the use of the verb "came" in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-25.htm">Galatians 3:25</a>). Why the supreme Disposer, the Father of his people, chose that particular era in the history of the human race for his children's passing into their majority is a deeply interesting subject of inquiry. Much has been said, as for example by Neander and Guerieke in their Histories of the Church, and by Schaff in his History of the Apostolic Church, on the preparedness of the world at large at just that juncture for the reception of the gospel. It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle had this in his mind in the reference here made to the Divine <span class="accented">prothesmia.</span> So far as appears, his view was fastened upon the history of the development of God's own people, which up to this time had been under the pedagogic custody of the Mosaic Law. Indeed, in just this context he does not even advert, as he may be supposed to have done in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, to the effect produced by the Law in preparing God's own people for the gospel, but speaks only of the negative aspect of the legal economy; that is, of those features of "bondage," "powerlessness," and "poverty" which marked it as a state of oppression and helplessness. The training, probably implied in the reference to its "rudiments," stands back for the present out of view; the only notion which is actually brought prominently forward being the comparatively degraded condition in which the child-proprietor was for that while detained. <span class="cmt_word">God sent forth his Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The terms here used require to be very closely considered: they arc fraught with the very essence of the gospel. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in nine other places of the New Testament, all of them in St. Luke's Gospel and the Acts. In six of these (<a href="../../par/luke/1-53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-10.htm">Luke 20:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>) the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> is well represented in our English Bible by "away." In the remaining three (<a href="../../par/acts/7-12.htm">Acts 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>) - "(Jacob) sent forth our fathers first;" "They sent forth Barnabas as far as to Antioch;" "God hath sent forth his angel")  - the preposition represented by "forth" expresses with more or less distinctness the idea that the person sent belonged intimately to the place or the society of the person who sent him. In no one passage is it without its appreciable value. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, without this second prepositional adjunct of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, is used, for example, in <a href="../../par/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a>, both of the Father sending the Son and of Christ sending his apostles" into the world," but without putting forward this indication of previous intimate connection. So the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in like manner of God sending his Son in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, and of the mission of the Holy Spirit in <a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. It was, no doubt, optional with the writer or speaker whether he would employ a verb denoting this particular shade of meaning present in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> or not; but we are not, therefore, at liberty to infer that, when he chooses to employ a verb which does denote it, he uses it without a distinct consciousness of its specific force. In the clause before us, therefore, as also in ver. 6, the writer must be assumed to have had in his mind at least the thought of heaven as the sphere of existence from which the Son and the Spirit were sent, as in <a href="../../par/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a> above cited, if not of some yet closer association with the Sender. The reference to a previously subsisting intimacy of being between the Sender and the Sent, which we trace here in the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> of the compound verb, is in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, where the verb employed is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated in the emphatic reference implied in the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "sending <span class="accented">his</span> own Son." In endeavouring next to determine the import of the expression," his Son," as here introduced, we are met by the surmise that the apostle may have written it <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, or by anticipation; that is, as describing, not what Christ was before he was sent forth, but the glory and acceptableness with the Almighty which marked him as the Messiah after his appearing in the world; for when, for example, in another place the apostle writes," Christ Jesus came into the world to rove sinners," he must be understood as expressing himself <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, designating the person who came into the world by the name and office which he bore as among men, and not as he was before he came. A <span class="accented">proleptic</span> designation is therefore conceivable. But this interpretation of the apostle's meaning is resisted by the tendency of the context in the kindred passage in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "God sending his own Son <span class="accented">in the likeness of the flesh of sin</span>;" for those added words betoken very strongly that Christ was viewed by the apostle as having been God's Son before he appeared in the flesh. And such is the impression which a reader not preoccupied with other  ideas would naturally receive also here. The conviction that this is what the apostle really intended is corroborated by references which he elsewhere makes to Christ's pro-incarnate existence and work; as, for example, in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; the latter of which passages, by describing "the Son of God's love" as "the Firstborn of every creature, because by him all things were created" (see Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' on the passage), betokens that St. Paul regarded him as having been even then the "Son of God;" and this, too, in the sense of derivation from "the substance of the Father, ... begotten" (as the Nicene Creed recites) "of his Father before all worlds." We may, therefore, reason, ably believe that the Apostle Paul, whose views alone are now under consideration, recognized these two senses of the term, namely, the theological and the Christologieal, as inseparably blending into one when thus applied to the Lord Jesus; for we must allow that it appears alien to his manner of sentiment and of representation to suppose that he ever uses it in the purely theological sense only. In the view of the apostle Christ was the "Son of God," not only when appointed to be the Messiah, but also before he was "made to be of a woman." Indeed, it should seem that this conception of his person is just that which forms the basis for the subsequent statement that the object of his coming into the world was to procure the adoption of sons for us. <span class="cmt_word">Made of a woman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">made to be of a woman.</span> This, indeed, was probably the sense intended by King James's translators, when they followed Wicklife and the Geneva Bible in rendering "made of a woman;" whilst Tyndale and Cranmer, followed by the Revisers of 1881, give "born of a woman." Just the same divergency of renderings appears in the same English translations in <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, "made of the seed of David (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;</span>)," except that Tyndale has "begotten" instead of "born." The difference in sense is appreciable and important: "made" implies a previous state of existence, which "born" does not. So far as the present writer can find, wherever in the New Testament the Authorized Version has "born," we have in the Greek either <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> never having this sense at all. As in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), "Being made a curse for us," and in <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "The Word was made flesh;" so here God's Son is described as "made to be of a woman," the phrase, "of a woman," being nearly identical in import with the word "flesh" in St. John, distinctly implying the fact of the Incarnation. The preposition "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) denotes derivation of being, as when it is found after the verb "to be" in <a href="../../par/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>, "He that is of God;" "Ye are not of God," pointing back to the claim which (ver. 41) the Jews had made that they had God for their Father. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to come to be, with a preposition occurs frequently, as in <a href="../../par/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>. There can be no doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken in the next clause with the same meaning as here. <span class="cmt_word">Made under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, <span class="accented">made to be under the Law.</span> The "Law" here, as in the clause immediately after "those under the Law," indicates, not Law in general, but that particular law of tutorship and of domination over one as yet in the depressed condition of a minor, which the apostle has just before spoken of; that is, a law of ceremonies and of external cult. The article is wanting in the Greek, as in <a href="../../par/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, etc. We cannot be unconscious of a tone of pathos in the apostle's language, thus declaring that he who had before been no less august a being than God's Son, should in conformity with his Father's will have stooped to derive being "from a woman," as well as to become subject to such a Law of servitude as that of Moses was. In the second chapter of the Philip-plans we have a similar account of the Incarnation, in which, with similar pathos, the apostle remarks that he took upon him the form of a "bond-servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), being made to be in the like condition to that of men (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); but in that passage the line of thought does not lead to a definite reference of his being made subject to the ceremonial Law. The apostle probably thinks of Christ as being made subject to the Law by his being circumcised; a child of Israelite parents, so long as he was uncircumcised, was repudiated by the Law as one not in the covenant. With reference to the preceding clause," made of a woman," we are naturally led to inquire why this particular was specified. It does not appear to be essential to his argument, as the next clause certainly is. Probably it was added as marking one of the successive steps down which the Son of God descended to that subjection ("servitude," ver. 3) to the ceremonial Law which the apostle is most particularly concerned with. As in <a href="../../par/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a>. he is exhibited, first as emptying himself; next, as taking upon him the form of a bond-servant by being made man; and then at length as brought to "the death of the cross;" so here, more briefly, he appears as "sent forth" from the bosom of the Father; next, as made "the son of a woman;" then as brought under the Law, to the end that (of course by the Crucifixion)  he might buy off from under the Law those who were subject  thereto. If the apostle intended anything more definite by introducing this first clause, it may have been to glance at that fellowship with the whole human race, with all "born of women" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>), into which God's own Son came by becoming himself "of a woman" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). To refer to yet another point, we can fearlessly affirm that this sentence of the apostle is perfectly <span class="accented">consistent</span> with the belief in the writer's mind that our Lord was born of a <span class="accented">virgin-mother</span>, for a specified reference to this fact did not lie in his way just at present, and therefore is not to be desiderated. The only point for consideration in this respect is whether the expression employed does at all allude to it. Many have thought that it does. But when we consider that "one born of woman." <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in Hebrew <span class="accented">yelud isshah</span>, was a set phrase to denote a human creature (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> [Septuagint]), with no particular reference to the woman except as the medium of our being introduced into the world, it has been with much probability judged by most recent critics that the clause shows no colouring of such allusion. Nevertheless, we distinctly recognize in it the sentiment expressed in the familiar verse of the ancient hymn: "Tu, ad liberandum suscepturus hominem, <span class="accented">non horruisti</span> virginis <span class="accented">uterum</span>;" else, why did not the apostle write <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>?

But why, in order to effect this object, was it prerequisite, as it is here implied that it was, that he should be himself "brought under the Law"? The directions which the Law in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a> gave with respect to those "hanged on a tree" were apparently held by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 27</a>) to apply also to the case of persons so hanged who were not Israelites. If so, does it not follow (an objector may say) that Jesus, even if not an Israelite under the Law, would, however, by being crucified, have fallen under the curse of the Law, and thereby annihilated the Law for all who by faith should become partakers with him, whether Jews or Gentiles? why, then, should be have been brought under the Law? The objection is met by the consideration that, in order that Christ might abrogate the Law by becoming subject to its curse, it was necessary that he should himself be perfectly acceptable to God, not only as being the eternal "Son of his love," but also in the entire completeness of his life as a man, and, therefore, by perfect obedience to the will of God as declared in the Law, under which it had pleased God to place his people. The Law, whatever the degradation which its ceremonial institute inferred for "the sons of God" subjected to it, was, nevertheless, for the time, God's manifest ordinance, to which all who sought to serve him were bound to submit them&deg; selves. They could not be righteous before him unless they walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless (<a href="../../par/luke/1-6.htm">Luke 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might</span> <span class="cmt_word">receive the adoption of sons</span> (<span class="greek_word">i%na th\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, that our adoptive sonship might be actually and in full measure made over to us. The" we" recites God's people; the same persons as those indicated by the preceding phrase, "those which were under the Law," which phrase was not meant to define one particular class among God's people, but to describe the condition in which God's people had been placed. Their Father had put them under the Law with the view of their being at his appointed time bought off from the Law and admitted to the full enjoyment of their filial privileges.

After the analogy of other compound verbal nouns with a similar termination (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, etc.), it means first the <span class="accented">act</span> of adoption, as, perhaps, <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>; and then, quite naturally, the consequent condition of the adopted child, as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; and this seems its more prominent sense here. <a href="../../par/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a> suggests the surmise  that the term had been in use before among Palestinian Jews, with reference to Israel's state under the theocracy, and that St. Paul borrowed it thence with reference to the Christian Church, in which it found a more complete realization. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And because ye are sons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). The apostle is adducing proof that God's people had actually received the adoption of sons; it was because it was so, that God had sent into their hearts the Holy Spirit, imparting that vivid consciousness of sonship which they enjoyed. The fact of the adoption must have been there, to <span class="accented">qualify</span> them to be recipients of this divinely inspired consciousness. The affirmation in <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>, "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God," closely resembles our present passage; but it is not identical. We are not made sons (the apostle intimates) by the Spirit giving us the consciousness of sonship; but, having been previously made sons, the Spirit raises in our spirits sentiments answering to the filial relation already established. The position of the clause introduced by "because" is like that in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-15.htm">1 Corinthians 12:15, 16</a>. The persons recited by the "ye" are still God's people; not the Galatian believers in particular, except as a portion of the whole Church of God. The apostle puts the thought in this form to bring the truth more strikingly home to their minds. This he does more closely still in the next verse by "thou." But that he has in view God's people as a whole is clear, not only from the whole strain of the context, but also from the phrase, "into our hearts," in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">God</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath sent forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">God sent forth.</span> The tense indicates that the apostle does not refer to a sending forth of God's Spirit to each individual believer, parallel to that "sealing" which believers are stated to be subjects of in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>. This historic aorist, as it does in ver. 4, points to one particular emission - that by which the Comforter was sent forth to take up his dwelling in the Church as his temple through all time (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of his Son</span>. The Spirit which "anointed" Jesus to be the <span class="accented">Christ</span>; which throughout animated the God-Man Jesus; which prompted him in full filial consciousness, himself in a certain critical hour with loud outcry (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to call out, "Abba, Father!" The phrase, "his Son," is aetiological; by it the apostle intimates that it was only congruous that the Spirit which had animated the whole life of the incarnate Son should be shed forth upon those who by faith become one with him, and should manifest his presence with them, as well as their union with Christ, by outcome of sentiment similar to that which Christ had expressed. Since the sonship of Christ is here spoken of as if it were not merely antecedent, but also in some way preparatory to the sending forth of the Spirit, it best suits the connection to construe it, not, as in ver. 4, as that belonging to him in his preincarnate state of being, but as that which appertained to him after being "made to be of a woman," and in which his disciples might be considered as standing on a certain footing of parity with him. This harmonizes with the relation which in the Gospels and Acts the sending of the Spirit is represented as holding to his resurrection and ascension. The interpretation above given in one point presupposes the apostle's knowledge of the story of the agony in the garden, when, according to St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>), Jesus himself used the words, "Abba. Father." This presupposition is warranted, not only by the probabilities of the case, but also by what we read in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a> of the Epistle to the Hebrews, Pauline, certainly, if not actually St. Paul's. We have to add that the Gospels not only make repeated mention of our Lord as addressing the Supreme Being by the compellative of "Father," but also represent him as constantly speaking of God as bearing that relation both to himself and to his disciples. This mode of designating the Almighty was characteristic in the highest degree of Jesus, and up to that time, so far as appears in the Scriptures, unknown. The manner in which the apostle here speaks of the "sending forth" of the Spirit in close proximity to the mention of the "sending forth" of the Son, strongly favours the belief that he regarded the Spirit, as being also a personal agent. In <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a> we have in the Septuagint "Thou wilt send forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) thy Spirit, and they will be created." In <a href="../../par/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> and Psalm 57:3 God is implored to "send forth [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint] his light and his truth," "his mercy and his truth;" these being poetically personified as angelic messengers. <span class="cmt_word">Into your</span> <span class="cmt_word">hearts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). But this reading of the Textus Receptus <span class="accented">is</span>, by recent editors, replaced by the reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">into our hearts</span>, the other reading being regarded as a correction designed to conform this clause with the words, "ye are sons," in the preceding one. In both cases the apostle has in his view the Church of God viewed generally. His putting "our" here instead of "your" was probably an outcome of his feeling of proud gladness in the thought of his own happy experience. A precisely similar change in the pronoun, attributable probably to the same cause, is observable in the remarkably analogous passage in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>,  "Ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." <span class="accented">Crying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">crying out aloud.</span> The word expressing loud utterance betokens in this case undoubting assurance. No faint whisper this of an inner consciousness, shy, reticent, because afraid to assure itself of so. glorious, so blissful a relation; no hesitating half-hope; it is a strong, unwavering conviction, bold, though humbly bold, to thus address the all-holy Supreme himself. The "cry" is here attributed to the Spirit himself; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a> to believers, these being the Spirit's organs of utterance; presently after in the Romans, vers. 26, 27, the Spirit himself is said to "intercede with groanings which cannot be uttered ...  . according to the will of God." Analogously, in the Gospels, evil spirits in demoniacs at times are said to "cry out" (<a href="../../par/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-26.htm">Mark 9:26</a>), while in other passages the cry is attributed to the possessed person. Abba, Father (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>). In addition to <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, just cited, the same remarkable words are found once only besides, in <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, as uttered by our Lord in the garden. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>) gives only "Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>); St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>), "my Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: in ver. 39, however, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is omitted by Tischendorf, though he retains it in ver. 42). St. Matthew, by adding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> here, which he does not add in Matthew 11:25, 26, seems to indicate that the form of address which our Lord then employed bespoke more than usual of fervency or of intimacy of communion. According to Furst ('Concordance'), "<span class="accented">Abba</span>," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, occurs frequently in the Targums "<span class="accented">sensu</span> proprio et honorifico;" in the Jerusalem Targum taking the form "Ibba," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>. In consequence, we may assume, of the "honorific" complexion of this form of the word, it was in Chaldee the form usually employed in compellation, or for the vocative. The hypothesis that either the Divine Sneaker, or the Evangelist Mark, or the Apostle Paul, added <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> as an explanatory adjunct to the Aramaic "Abba," for the benefit of such as might need the explanation, is resisted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the threefold recurrence of the conjoined phrases in just the same form; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the absence of any such intimation of a translation as we find given in other passages where an Aramaic word is explained, as in <a href="../../par/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 41, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> being made by St. Paul in the Romans, when writing with a glowing ardour of strong feeling wholly repugnant to the didactic calmness of a translational gloss: he does not pause to add such a gloss to "Maranatha" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, where it would seem to be much more called for. The apparently nominatival form of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> lends no countenance to this view, as is shown by the comparison of <a href="../../par/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>: <a href="../../par/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54, 41</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: and in the Septuagint, <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1, 9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="../../par/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Another hypothesis that the twofold compellative was meant to intimate that God was now Father alike to Jewish believers and to Gentile, is wrecked upon its occurrence in St. Mark. The present writer ventures to surmise that the conjoined phrase originated thus: The Lord Jesus, being wont very commonly to substitute for the name "God" the designation of "Father," may be supposed to have used for this designation the word "Abba" as the honorific form of the Chaldaic noun for "father," in much the same way as the Jews regularly substituted the noun <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, an honorific form of <span class="accented">Adonim</span>, "lord," or "master," for the unutterable tetragrammaton, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>. Instead of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, Christ (it may be supposed) customarily employed the word "Abha," as an almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Supreme Being. When our Lord had occasion to apply the word "Father" as a <span class="accented">common noun</span> to God, whether in addressing him or in speaking of him, we may infer firm the Peshito-Syriac Version of <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a> that he added another form of the same original noun "<span class="accented">Abj</span>," or "<span class="accented">Obj</span>," instead of or in addition to "Abba." The <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> of <a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a> may have been used to represent "<span class="accented">Abba</span>;" St. Matthew's <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to represent "<span class="accented">Abj"</span> or "<span class="accented">Obj."</span> The use of "<span class="accented">Abba</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> by believers, probably quite an exceptional <span class="accented">use</span>, was adopted, both as a conscious reminiscence of Christ's utterance in the garden - they, by conjoining themselves thus with their Lord, pleading, as it were, his Name as their warrant for claiming this filial relation with the Most High - and also as an intensely emphatic description of God's fatherhood, by conjoining together the almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> denoting his general fatherhood by which (supposably) Christ was used to designate God, and the <span class="accented">common noun</span> by which Christ's disciples had by him been taught to address him in prayer, and which embodied their sense of his especial fatherhood to those who serve him. The apostle is not to be understood as intimating that the Holy Spirit does actually produce in every heart in which he dwells the definite consciousness of sonship. It is enough for his purpose that the <span class="accented">nisus</span>, the endeavour and tendency of his spiritual operation, is in all cases in that direction, though through slackness on their own part so many Christians fail of conquering for themselves the full possession of their inheritance. But,  however, we need not (he implies)go back to Mosaic ceremonialism to seek <span class="accented">there</span> for our assured sonship. We <span class="accented">have</span> it already here - here, in Christ, and in the indwelling presence of his Spirit.

It here marks the conclusion resulting from the statements of the preceding six verses, viz. of God having sent forth his Son to do away with the Law, subjection to which had marked the nonage of his people, and to raise them to their complete filial position, and of his then sending forth his Spirit into their hearts loudly protesting their sonship. "No longer art thou;" by this individualizing address the apostle strives to awaken each individual believer to the consciousness of the filial position belonging to him in particular. Believe it: in Christ Jesus, thou, thine own very self, art a son! The phrase, "no longer," marks the position of God's servant new, as compared with what it would have been before Christ had wrought his emancipating work and the Holy Spirit had been sent forth as the Spirit of adoption; <span class="accented">then</span> he would have still been a bond-servant; he is not that now. This abrupt singling out one individual as a sample of all the members of a class is an instance of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>). The individual cited by the "thou" is neither a Gentile convert only nor a Jewish believer only; it is any member of God's kingdom.

The inheritance here meant is the possession of every blessing which the theocratic kingdom entitles its members to look forward to. And the point of this added clause is that no further qualification is needed for our having a vested right in that inheritance, than that which is supplied by faith in Christ, uniting us to him and making us sharers with him; no such qualification, for example, as the Mosaizing reactionaries insisted upon (see <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>); no observance of ceremonial rites, whether of the Law or of such freaks of heretical" will-worship" as are referred to in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. Thy faith in Christ (says in effect the apostle) gives thee now for good and all an assured place in whatever inheritance God designs to give his people. The manuscripts 'rod other authorities for the text present considerable variety in the reading of the last words of this clause. The reading adopted by L. T. Tr., Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, and Hort and Westcott, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, is that found in the three oldest uncials, and presents a form of expression which was likely so greatly to surprise the copyist as to set him naturally upon the work of revision; whereas that of the Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would have seemed to him so perfectly natural and easy that he would never have thought of altering it. The words, "<span class="accented">heir</span> through <span class="accented">God</span>," taken in connection with the foregoing context, insist upon the especial appointment of the supreme God himself; his intervention displayed in the most conspicuous manner conceivable, through the incarnated Son and the sent-forth Spirit. The believer is here said to be a son and an heir "through God," in the same sense as St. Paul affirms himself to be an apostle "through Jesus Christ and God the Father," and "through the will of God" (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>); for "of him and through him and unto him are all things," and most manifestedly so, the things composing the economy of grace which the gospel announces (<a href="../../par/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>). The apostle has thus brought back his discourse to the same point which it had reached before in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>. The reader will do well to carefully compare this section of the Epistle (vers. 3-7) with <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25-8:4</a> and Romans 8:14-17. With great similarity in the forms of expression, the difference of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> object in the two Epistles is clearly discerned. <span class="accented">There</span> he is discoursing the more prominently of the believer's emancipation <span class="accented">from the controlling power of a sinful nature</span>, which, under the Law, viewed under its moral aspect rather than its ceremonial, was rather fretted into yet more aggravated disobedience than quelled or overpowered. <span class="accented">Here</span> his subject is more prominently the believer's emancipation from the thraldom of the Law's cere-monialism, which in the present Epistle, relative to the troubles in the Galatian Churches, he has more occasion to deal with. Both the one deliverance, however, and the other was necessary for the believer's full consciousness of adoptive sonship; and each was, in fact, involved in the other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-8.htm">Galatians 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>); a strongly adversative conjunction, belonging to the  whole sentence comprised in this and the next verse, which are closely welded together by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. In contravention of God's work of grace just described, they were renouncing their sonship and making themselves slaves afresh. Then (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, with its balancing <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, here, as often is the case, unites together sentences not in their main substance strictly adverse to each other, but only in subordinate details contrasted, of which we have an exemplary instance in <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In such cases we have often no resource in English but to leave the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> untranslated, as our Authorized Version commonly does; "indeed" or "truly," for example, would be more or less misleading. The truth is, the apostle in these two verses is heaping reproach upon the Galatian Judaizers; first, in this verse, for their former (guilty) ignorance of God and their idolatries, and then, in the next verse, for their slighting that blessed friendship with God which they owed only to his preventing grace. In dealing with Gentile Christians the apostle repeatedly is found referring to their former heathenism, for the purpose of enforcing humility or abashing presumption, as for example in <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13, 17</a>. In the case of the Galatians his indignation prompts him to use a degree of outspoken severity which he was generally disposed to forbear employing. The "then" is not defined, as English readers might perhaps misconstrue the Authorized Version as intending, by the following clause, "not knowing God," which in that version is "when ye knew not God" - a construction of the words which the use of the participle would hardly warrant; rather the time referred to by the adverb is the time of which he has before been speaking, when God's people were under the pedagogy of the Law. This, though when compared with Christ's liberty a state of bondage, was, however (the apostle feels), a position of high advancement as compared with that of heathen idolaters. These last were "<span class="accented">far</span> off," while the Israelites were "<span class="accented">nigh"</span> (compare the <span class="accented">passages</span> just now referred to). During that time of legal pedagogy the Galatians and their forefathers, all in the apostle's view forming one class, were wallowing in the mire of heathenism. <span class="cmt_word">When ye knew not</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou)k ei)do/te Qeo/n</span>); <span class="accented">ye knew not God and</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> "Knowing not God" describes the condition of heathens also in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>," Not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) God;" <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, "Rendering vengeance to them that know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) God." Both of these passages favour the view that the apostle does not in the least intend in the present clause to <span class="accented">excuse</span> the idolatries which he goes on to speak of, but rather to describe a condition of godlessness which, as being positive rather than merely negative, inferred utter pravity and guiltiness. He uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> with the participle here, in place of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the two <span class="accented">passages c</span>ited from the <span class="accented">Thessalonians</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> intending to state an historical fact viewed absolutely - a sense which is made clear in English by substituting an indicative verb for the participle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did service unto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">served</span>; devoted yourselves to. The verb is, perhaps, used here in that milder sense in which it frequently occurs; as in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The Revised Version, however, gives "were in bondage to" in the present instance, but "serve" in the <span class="accented">passages now</span> cited. The aorist, instead of an imperfect, describes the form of religious life which they then led as a whole. <span class="cmt_word">Them which by nature are</span> <span class="cmt_word">no gods</span> (<span class="greek_word">toi  =   fu/sei mh\ ou  =  si</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, which would apparently mean "which arc not gods by nature, but only in your imagination;" like "There be that are called gods," in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a> - Zeus, Apollo, Here, etc., mere figments of imagination (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). The more approved reading suggests rather the idea that the objects they worshipped might not be non-existent, but were certainly not of a Divine nature; "by nature," that is, in the kind of being to which they belong (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; Wisd. 13:1, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The question may be asked - If they were not gods, what then were they? The apostle would probably have answered, "Demons;" for thus he writes to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>): "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and not to God." Alford renders, "to gods which by nature exist not," etc.; but the more obvious sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is that of a copula merely (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>, Septuagint, "He became a priest (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>)").

The former, however, is the verb more commonly used in this relation; by St. John, in his First Epistle, where so much is said of  knowing God, exclusively; although in other relations he, both in Epistle and Gospel, uses the two verbs interchangeably. The expression, "to know God," is one of profound pregnancy; denoting nothing less than that divinely imparted intuition of God, that consciousness of his actual being, viewed in his relation to ourselves, which is the result of truly "believing in him." Moreover, as it is knowing a personal Being, between whom and ourselves mutual Action may be looked for, it implies a mutual conversancy between ourselves and him, as the term "acquaintance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), as used in <a href="../../par/luke/2-44.htm">Luke 2:44</a> and 23. 49, naturally does. So that "having gotten to be known of God" is very nearly equivalent to having been by God brought to be, to speak it reverently, on terms of acquaintanceship with him; and this does indeed seem to be meant in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>. The Galatian believers had in very truth gotten to know God, if they had learnt to cry out unto him, "Abba, Father." And the remembrance of this happy experience of theirs, which he had, we may suppose, himself witnessed in the early days of their discipleship, prompts him to introduce the correction, "or rather to be known of God." Their having attained such a consciousness of sonship had been, as he writes, ver. 7, "through God;" he it was that had sent forth his Sen that his people might receive the adoption of sons; he that had sent forth his Spirit into their hearts to give them the sense of sonship; he had shown that he knew, recognized them to be his (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>), by gifting them with the blissful prerogative of knowing what he was to them. The correction of "knowing" by "being known" is analogous to that of "apprehend" by "being apprehended" in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>. The pragmatic value of this correcting clause is to make the Galatians feel, not only what a wilful self-debasement it was on their part, but also what a slight put upon the Divine favours shown to them, that they should frowardly repudiate their filial standing to adopt afresh that servile standing out of which he had lifted his people. What was this but a high-handed contravening of God's own work, a frustration of his gospel? And this by them whom only the other day he had rescued from the misery and utter wickedness of idolatry! <span class="cmt_word">How turn ye again</span>; or, back (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">how turn ye back again.</span> An abrupt change from the form of sentence which the foregoing words naturally prepared us for; which might have been such as we should have by simply omitting the "how." As if it were, "After having gotten to be known of God, ye are turning back again - how can ye? - to the weak," etc. This "how," as in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>, is simply a question of remonstrance; not expecting an answer, it bids the person addressed consider the amazing unseemliness of his proceeding (so <a href="../../par/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-5.htm">1 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).

The description is relative rather than absolute. The horn-book, useful enough for the mere child, is of no use whatever to the grown-up lad who has left school. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a> mention is made of "the weakness and unprofitableness" of the Levitical Law relative to the expiation of sin; which is not precisely the aspect of the Law which is here under view. The word "beggarly" was probably in the writer's mind contrasted with "the unsearchable riches of Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again</span>? The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is here, differently from ver. 8, contrasted with the condition of a son enjoying his full independence (see ver. 25 and <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). It would be an insufferable constraint and degradation to the full-grown son to be set to con over and repeat the lessons of the infant school. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, afresh, over again, intensifies <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by adding the notion of making a fresh start from the commencing-point of the course indicated. The application of these words, together especially with the phrase, "turn back again," in the preceding clause, to the case of the Galatian converts from idolatrous heathenism, has suggested to many minds the idea that St. Paul groups the ceremonialism of heathen worship with that of the Mosaic Law. Bishop Lightfoot in particular has here a valuable note, in which, with his usual learning and breadth of view, he shows how the former might in <span class="accented">its ritualistic element</span> have subserved the purpose of a disciplinary training for a better religion. Such a view might be regarded as not altogether out of harmony with the apostle's spirit as evinced in his discourses to the Lyeaonians and the Athenians (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15-17</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>). But though in his wide sympatheticalness he might, if discoursing with heathens, have sought thus to win them to a better faith, he is hardly just now in a mood for any such sympathetic tolerance. He is much too indignant at the behaviour of these Galatian revolters to allow that <span class="accented">their</span>  former religious ceremonies could have been good enough to be admitted to group with those of the Law of Moses: he has just before adverted to their former heathenism for the very purpose of (so to speak) setting them down - a purpose which would be a good deal defeated by his referring to that cult of theirs as in any respect standing on a level with the cult of the Hebrews. Indeed, it may be doubted whether, at the utmost limit to which he would at any time have allowed himself to go, in the "economy" which he unquestionably was used to employ in dealing with souls, he would, however, have gone so far as to class the divinely appointed ordinances of Israel, the training-school of God's own children, with the ritual of demon-inspired worships. It is much easier to suppose that the apostle identifies the Galatian Churchmen with God's own people, with whom they were now in fact <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, blended in corporal identity with them. God's children had heretofore been in bondage to the A, B, C, of the Law, but were so no longer; if any of those who were now God's children took it in hand to observe that Law, then were they, though not in their individual identity, yet in their corporate identity, turning <span class="accented">back again</span> to the A, B, C, from which they had been emancipated.

The accumulation of nouns with the reiterated "and," furnishing another example of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style, betokens a scornfully impatient mimesis. These reactionaries were full of festival-observing pedantry - "days," "new moons," "festivals," "holy years," being always on their lips. The meaning of the first three of the nouns is partially suggested by <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "Let no man judge you...  in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a sabbath day (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" in which passage, we may observe, there is a similar tone of half-mocking mimesis; where the same ideas are apparently presented, but in a reverse order. Comp. also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>, Offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles." The "days," then, in the present passage, we may suppose, are the sabbath days, together perhaps with the two fast days every week which the Jewish tradition prescribed (<a href="../../par/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>). The "months" point to the new moons, the observance of which might occasion to these Gentiles considerable scope for discussion in adjusting themselves to the Jewish calendar, different no doubt from the calendar they had been hitherto used to. The "seasons" would be the annual festivals and fasts of the Jews, not only the three prescribed by the Levitical Law, but also certain others added by tradition, as the Feasts of Purim and of Dedication. So far we appear to be on tolerably sure ground. The fourth item, "years," may refer either to the sabbatical year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2-7</a>), which at any rate latterly the Jews had got to pay much attention to (1 Macc. 6:49, 53; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:10, 6; also 14:16, 2; Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:4); or possibly the jubilee years, one such fiftieth year, it might be, falling about this time due. Bengel ('Gnomon') supposes that a sabbatical year might be being held A.D. , to which date he assigns this Epistle; while Wieseler ('Chronicles Synops.,' p. 204, etc., referred to by Bishop Lightfoot) offers a similar conjecture for the year A.D.  autumn to A.D.  autumn. Very striking is the impatience which the apostle manifests in overhearing as it were the eager discussions occupying the attention of these foolish Galatian Judaizers. Their interest, he perceived, was absorbed by matters which were properly for them things of no concern at all, but which, with ostentatious zeal as such persons do, they were <span class="accented">making</span> their concern. The cause of their doing so lay, we may believe, in the feeling which was growing up in their minds that such like outward observances would of themselves make their life acceptable to God; this general sentiment habiting itself, in the choice of the particular form of outward ceremonies to be adopted, in the observance of the celebrations given by God to his people for the season of their nonage. The principle itself was no doubt repugnant to the apostle's mind, even apart from the Judaizing form which it was  assuming, and which threatened a defection from Christ. Curious regard to such matters he evidently on its own account regards with scorn and impatience. But therewith also the old venerable religion, localized at Jerusalem as its chief seat, would under the impulse of such sentiments be sure to perilously attract their minds away from the "reformation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>) to which it had now been subjected; and they were in danger of losing, nay, had in great degree at least already lost, the zest which they once had fell in embracing the exceeding great and precious gifts which Christ had brought to them. What was there here but the "evil heart of unbelief" spoken of in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>, "in departing from the living God," now manifesting himself to his people in his Son? It is this animus characterizing the behaviour of the Galatian Churchmen which marks its essential difference as compared with that observance of "days" and "meats" which in <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. the apostle treats as a matter, relative to which Christians were to live in mutual tolerance. As long as a Christian continued to feel his relation to the Lord Jesus (<a href="../../par/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6-9</a>), it mattered not much if he thought it desirable to observe the Jewish sabbath or to abstain from eating animal food. He might, indeed, make himself thereby chargeable with spiritual unwisdom; the apostle clearly thought he would; but if he still held fast by Christ as the sole and all-sufficing Source to him of righteousness before God and of spiritual life, he was to be received and welcomed as a brother, without being vexed by interference with these foolish tenets of his. It became different when his care for such really indifferent externals took his heart away from a satisfied adherence to the Lord; then his ceremonialism or asceticism became rank and even fatal heresy. And this was what the apostle was fearing on behalf of his once so greatly cherished disciples in Galatia.

This passage in the Thessalonians serves to illustrate the nature of the mischief, which, in the present case, the apostle feared might result. For one thing, there was the hurt, the perhaps fatal hurt, which the Galatian believers might themselves receive from that virtual renouncement of their spiritual inheritance which they now seemed to be foolishly making. But there was also the disappointment which would accrue to himself through the failure of his work among them: "For what," as he wrote to the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:19, "is our hope, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?" The same anticipated joy he speaks of in writing to the Philippians, as about to accrue to himself from the steadfastness of his converts: "That I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, neither labour in vain." This anticipation was a joy which he would fain not have wrested from him.

"Be as I;" to wit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus as our sole and all-sufficing Righteousness before God, and in that faith letting go all care about rites and ceremonies of the Law of Moses, or indeed ceremonialism of any kind, as if such things mattered at all here, in the business of being well-pleasing to God, whether done or forborne. "Because I on my part am as ye." I, a born Jew, once a zealous worker - out of legal ceremonial righteousness, have put that aside, and have placed myself on the footing of a mere Gentile, content to live like a Gentile (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>), trusting in Christ like as any Gentile has to de who was bare alike of Jewish prerogative and of ceremonial righteousness. This "for" or "because" is an appeal to them for loving sympathy and fellow-working. What was to become of him if <span class="accented">Gentiles</span> withheld from him <span class="accented">their</span> practical sympathy with his religious life? To what other quarter could he look for it? From Jewish sympathy he was an utter outcast. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "brethren, I entreat," comes in here as a breathing forth of intense imploring. And a remarkable instance is here afforded of that abrupt, instantaneous transition in the expression of feeling  which is one great characteristic of St. Paul when writing in one of his more passionate moods. Compare for this the flexure of passionate feeling prevailing through the tenth and three following chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. Just before, in this chapter, vers. 8-11, the language has been that of stern upbraiding, and, indeed, as if <span class="accented">de haut en bas</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> from one who from the high level of Israelite pre-eminence was addressing those who quite recently were mere outcast heathens. But here he seems suddenly caught and carried away by a flood of passionate emotion of another kind. The remembrance comes to his soul of his own former sorrows, when he "<span class="accented">suffered</span> the <span class="accented">less</span> of all things," as he so pathetically tells the Philippians (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-14</a>); when in the working out of his own salvation, and that of the Gentiles to whom he had been appointed to minister, he had cut himself off from all that he had once prized, and from all the attachments of kindred and party and nation. A terrible rending had it been for him when he had ceased to be a Jew; his <span class="accented">flesh</span> still quivered at the recollection, though his <span class="accented">spirit</span> rejoiced in Christ Jesus. And now this mood of feeling prompts him to cast himself almost as it were at the feet of these Gentile converts, adjuring them not to turn away from him, not to bereave him of <span class="accented">their</span> fellowship and sympathy. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have not injured me at all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">no wrong have ye done me.</span> This commences a new sentence, which runs on through the next three verses. The apostle is anxious to remove from their minds the apprehension that he was offended with them on the ground of unkindness shown by them towards himself. It was true that he had been writing to them in strong terms of displeasure and indignation; but this was altogether on account of their behaviour towards the gospel, not at all on account of any injury that he had himself to complain cf. He is well aware of the virulent operation of the sentiment expressed by the old maxim, "Odimus quos laesimus;" and is therefore eager and anxious to take its sting out of the mutual relations between himself and them. When the apostle is writing under strong emotion, the connecting links of thought are frequently difficult to discover; and this is the case here. But this seems to be the thread of connection: the Galatian Christians would not be ready to accord him any sympathetic compliance with his entreaty that they would "<span class="accented">be as</span> he <span class="accented">was</span>," if they thought he entertained towards them sentiments of soreness or resentment on personal grounds. There was no reason, he tells them, why they should; they had done him no wrong. There is no reason for supposing that the time of the action referred to in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is identical with that indicated by the aorists of the two next verses. From the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the first time," in ver. 13, it is clear, as critics have generally felt, that there had been a second visit after that one. If so, a disclaimer of offence taken during the first visit would not have obviated the suspicion of offence taken during a later one. The aorist of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> must, therefore, cover the whole period of intercourse. Perhaps thus: whatever wrong you may suspect me of charging you with, be assured I do not charge you with it; there was no personal affront then offered me. In what follows, it is true, he dwells exclusively upon the enthusiastic demonstration which they made of their personal attachment to him when he first visited them; but though the assertion here made is not to its full extent proved good by the particulars given in vers. 13 and 14, and though the enthusiasm of personal kindness there described must, under the circumstances, have very considerably abated; yet, very supposably, nothing may have occurred since then - nothing, for example, during his second visit - which would show that they now disowned those feelings of love and respect. At all events, he refuses to allow that there had. No personal affront had he to complain of; while, on the other hand, their former intense kindness had laid up as it were a fund of responsive affection and gratitude in his bosom which could not be soon exhausted.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is the common word for "being sick," as <a href="../../par/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-10.htm">Luke 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>, etc. It is possible that the apostle meant to say that the Galatians might not unnaturally have thought themselves treated slightingly in that his remaining among them so long was owing to illness and not to his own choice; but that yet, for all that, they had shown themselves most eager in welcoming their involuntary visitor. The words, however, do not require to be thus construed, and in all probability intend no more than to bring back to their remembrance the disorder under which he was then suffering. The illness would seem to have been of a nature to make his personal appearance in some way unsightly, and even repulsive; for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, spat out, of the next verse suggests even the latter idea. Evidently this disorder, as also the one noted in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, did not disqualify him for ministerial work altogether. He adverts to the circumstance, as making it yet more remarkable and more grateful to his feelings, that, notwithstanding the disagreeable aspect which in some way his disorder presented to those about him, they had cherished his presence among them with so much kindness as they did and also with such reverential respect. How it was that his illness brought about this protracted stay, whether it was that he fell ill while journeying through the country so as to be unable to pursue his way to his ulterior destination, or whether the remarkable healthiness of the climate either first attracted him thither or detained him there for convalescence (see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 10, note 2, for the character of the climate at Angora, the ancient Ancyra), it is impossible for us to determine. It is noticeable that St. Chrysostom's comments on the passage appear to show that he considered the apostle to be simply stating the circumstances <span class="accented">under which</span> and not those <span class="accented">in consequence of which</span> he preached the gospel to them; and so also OEcumenius and Theophylact paraphrase <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, suggesting the conjecture that they and St. Chrysostom understood the words as equivalent to "during a period of infirmity of the flesh." But this gives to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with an accusative a sense which, to say the least, is not a common one. Is this illness of body to be connected with the affliction, most probably a bodily affliction, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, "the stake in the flesh"? This latter affliction has been discussed very fully by Dean Stanley and Meyer on the Corinthians, by Bishop Lightfoot in his commentary on the Galatians, and by Dr. Farrar in his ' Life of St. Paul.' It appears to have first befallen the apostle after the "revelations" accorded to him fourteen years before he wrote his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which he is supposed to have done in the autumn of A.D. . This would bring us back to about A.D. . The apostle's first visit to Galatia, according to Bishop Lightfoot, p. 22, took place about A.D. . When we consider that no doubt many of those wearing labours and hardships, interspersed with frequent suffering of gross personal outrage, recounted in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, had been undergone in the eight first of those fourteen years (the stoning at Lystra certainly had), it must seem very precarious to conjecture that the malady here referred to was a recurrence of just that particular disorder experienced eight years before. How many other ailments might not the apostle have been subject to, amid the cruel allotment of suffering and hardship which prevailingly marked his course! It is quite as probable, to say the least, that he may then have been suffering in health or in limb from some assault of personal violence recently undergone. St. Luke gives no particulars whatever of this portion of St. Paul's journey, which is only just mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. The apostle visited Corinth for the first time not many months after this first sojourn in Galatia; and it is interesting to observe that he speaks of his having then ministered to them in "feebleness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>), in a manner strongly suggestive of bodily weakness. <span class="cmt_word">At the first</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">the first time</span> - an expression plainly implying that there had been a subsequent sojourn. Respecting this latter visit, all we know is what we have so cursorily stated in <a href="../../par/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>; unless, perchance, we may be able to draw some inferences relating to it from what we read in this Epistle itself. Chronologers are pretty well agreed in placing the commencement of this third apostolical journey about three years after the commencement of the second.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament found only in St. Luke and St. Paul, means always, not merely "to despise," but to <span class="accented">express</span> contempt for a thing, "to scout" (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a>).

Critics have remarked that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is not found elsewhere used thus metaphorically as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is, is probably so applied here by the apostle to produce a kind of alliteration after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: as if it were "Non reprobastis, nec <span class="accented">respuistis."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but as an angel of God received ye me</span>, <span class="accented">as Christ Jesus.</span> Their first feeling of aversation from his personal appearance gave place to emotions of delight in his message of which he seemed as it were the embodiment, and of reverential love and gratitude to himself.

The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which is that of the best manuscripts, is now generally accepted in preference to that of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, in which, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> stands on a higher footing of evidence than the remaining word <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This latter reading may be taken to mean: either, "Of what sort, then, was that gratulation of yours? "that is, what was its value in respect to the depth of conviction on which it was founded? - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="accented">qualis</span>, as <a href="../../par/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>, etc., which would bring us to much the same result as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: or, "How great, then, was that gratulation of yours!" But the "then" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) comes in lamely; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("at that time") would have been more in place; and, further, it is questionable whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of admiration ever occurs without the wonder taking a tinge of inquiry, as, for example, <a href="../../par/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which would be out of place here. With the more approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, the apostle asks, "What is, then, become of that gratulation of yourselves?" The "then" recites the fact, implied in the description given of their former behaviour, that they did once felicitate themselves on the apostle's having brought them the gospel. This is more directly brought into view in the words which follow. As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "pronounce happy," as <a href="../../par/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> and <a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> denotes "pronouncing one to be happy;" as <a href="../../par/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6, 9</a>. So Clement of Rome ('Ad Cor.,' 50), who weaves the apostle's words into his own sentence with the same meaning. This felicitation must have been pronounced by the Galatians upon themselves, not upon the apostle; the apostle would have spoken of himself on the object of their <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not of their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For I bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">you record</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for I bear you witness</span>; testify on your behalf; the phrase always denoting commendation (<a href="../../par/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Compare "Ye were running well," <a href="../../par/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>.

The omission of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>, which is rejected by recent editors, perhaps intimates the certainty and readiness with which they would have done it; but the particle occurs very sparingly in the New Testament as compared with classical Greek. There seems something strange in the specification of this particular form of evidencing zealous attachment. If there had otherwise appeared any question of making gifts, the apostle might have been construed to mean, "Ye were ready to give me anything, your very eyes even;" but this is not the case. Possibly the particular mention of "the Churches of Galatia" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> may have been occasioned by their having shown an especial readiness, even at the apostle's second sojourn among  them, to take part in the collection referred to; or by their having been the first Churches he came to in that particular tour, the directions which he gave to them being given also to all the Churches he went on to visit; but on this point see Introd. p. 16. The tone of <a href="../../par/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6-10</a> does not betoken especial open-handedness on their part, unless, perhaps, the words, "let us not grow weary," hint at a liberality once displayed but now declined from. On the whole, this specification of "eyes" seems rather to point to there having been something amiss with the apostle's own eyes, either from ophthalmia or as the effect of personal outrage perpetrated upon him. It is especially deserving of notice how the apostle, in the two clauses of this verse, links together their joy in their newly found Christian blessedness with their grateful love to himself; the latter fact is adduced as proof of the former. Their gospel happiness, he feels, was indissolubly woven in with their attachment to him: if they let go their joy in Christ Jesus, as, apart from any qualification to be acquired by observances of the Law of Moses, their all-sufficient righteousness, they must also of necessity become estranged from him, who was nothing if not the exponent and herald to them of that happiness. This consideration is of great moment for the right understanding of the next verse.

If the apostle were referring only to something which had taken place at his second visit, he would have probably used different tenses; either, perhaps, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - compare <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a> (or with a contemporaneous aorist participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">or</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>. As it stands, "<span class="accented">dealing</span> with you according to truth" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) expresses the apostle's continuous declaration of the gospel, and his never-flinching ins]stance upon the mortal danger of defection from it (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); and "I am become your enemy" points to the result now manifesting itself from this steadfast attitude of his, in consequence of their <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of meriting his disapproval. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> occurs only once in the Septuagint - in <a href="../../par/genesis/42-16.htm">Genesis 42:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, "Whether there be any truth in you" (Authorized Version and Hebrew); and once besides in the New Testament - in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>, where the verb denotes, apparently, not merely being truthful in speech, but the whole habit of addiction both to uprightness and to God's known truth; for we can hardly leave out of our view this latter idea, when we consider how frequently the apostle designates the gospel by the term "the truth" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-8.htm">2 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). "Enemy" is either one regarded as adopting a hostile position to them, or one viewed with hostile feeling by them, which latter is its sense in <a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>. The above exposition of the import of this verse is confirmed by the consideration that the Epistle affords no trace of the apostle's relations with the Galatian converts having been other than mutually friendly at even his second visit to them. This fact is implied in ver. 12, and <a href="../../par/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a> furnishes no evidence to the contrary; for those warnings may have been uttered in his first visit as well as in his second, without occasioning or being occasioned by any want of mutual confidence. This view of their mutual relations is confirmed likewise by the feelings of indignant astonishment with which evidently the apostle took up his pen to address them in this letter: the tidings which had just reached him had been a painful surprise to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">They zealously affect you, <i>but</i> not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They zealously affect you, but</span> <span class="cmt_word">not well</span> (<span class="greek_word">zhlou  =  sin u(ma  =   ou) kalw  =  </span>); <span class="accented">they admire you in no good way.</span> Of the several  senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, those of "envy," "emulate," "strive after," are plainly unsuitable in this verse and the one which follows. So also are the senses "to be zealous on one's behalf, to be jealous of one," which in Hellenistic usage crept into it, apparently from its having been in other senses adopted to represent the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">qinne</span>, and borrowing these from this Hebrew verb. The only phase of its meaning which suits the present passage is that which it perhaps by far the most frequently presents in ordinary Greek, though not so commonly in the Septuagint and in the New Testa ment, namely, "to admire," "deem and pronounce highly fortunate and blessed." When used in this sense, it has properly for its object a person; but with a suitable qualification of meaning it may have for its object something inanimate. Very often is the accusative of the person accompanied with the genitive of the ground of gratulation, as Aristophanes, 'Ach.,' 972, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>  "I congratulate, admire, you for your cleverness;" see also 'Equit.,' 834; 'Thes moph.,' 175; 'Vesp.,' 1450; but not always; thus Demosthenes, 'Fals. Legat.,' p. 424, "(<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) they admire and congratulate and would each one be himself the like;" 'Adv. Lept.,' p. 500 (respecting public funeral orations), "This is the custom of men admiring (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) virtue, not of men looking grudgingly upon those who on its account are being honoured;" Xenophon, 'Mere.,' 2:1,19. "Thinking highly of themselves, and praised and admired (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">by</span> others;" Josephus, 'C. Ap.,' 1:25, "(<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) admired by many." It thus seems to be often just equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, with the sense of which latter verb it is brought into close neighbourhood in Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188, "' Blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>), Strepsiades, are you, both for being so wise yourself and for having such a son as you have,' - thus will my friends and fellow-wardsmen say, in admiration of me (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)." Probably this is the sense in which the apostle uses the verb in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I rejoice in your felicity with an infinite joy;" referring to the intense admiration which he felt of their present felicity, in their having been betrothed a chaste maiden to Christ; not till the next verse introducing the mention of his fear lest this paradisaical happiness might be darkened by the wiles of Satan. It is in a modified shade of the same sense that the word is employee  - where it is rendered "covet earnestly" in our Authorized Version in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. In the passage now. before us, then, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "they admire you," that is, they tell you so. They were expressing strong admiration of the high Christian character and eminent gifts of these simple-minded believers; the charisms which had been bestowed upon them (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>); their virtues, in contrast especially with their heathen neighbours; their spiritual enlightenment. No doubt all this was said with the view of courting their favour; but <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> can hardly itself mean "court favour," and no instance of its occurring in this sense has been adduced; and this rendering of the verb breaks down utterly in ver. 18. The persons referred to must, of course, be understood as those who were busy in instilling at once Judaizing sentiments and also feelings of antipathy to the apostle himself, as if he were their enemy (ver. 16). The Epistle furnishes no indication whatever that these persons were strangers coming among them from without, answering, for example, to those spoken of in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> as disturbing the Antiochian Church. It is quite supposable that the warning which, not long after the writing of this Epistle, the apostle addressed to the Ephesian elders at Miletus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>), when putting them on their guard against those who "from among their own selves should rise up speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them," was founded in part upon this experience of his in the Galatian Churches. Galatian Churchmen it may well have been, and no other, who now (as the apostle had just been apprised) were employing that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that "kind suave speech" and that "speech of compliment and laudation," which in <a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a> he describes as a favourite device of this class of deceivers, to win the ear of their unwary brethren. "In no good way;" for they did it insincerely and with the purpose of drawing them <span class="accented">into</span> courses which, though these men themselves knew it not, were nevertheless fraught with ruin to their spiritual welfare. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they would</span> <span class="cmt_word">exclude you;</span> or, us (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">nay<span class="cmt_word"></span>,</span> <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">to shut you out is their wish.</span> The reading "us," noticed in the margin of the Authorized Version, is probably a merely conjectural emendation made in the Greek text by Beza, wholly unsupported by manuscript authority. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is adversative to the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, the secondary thought of the preceding clause, in the same way as the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> is adversative to the secondary negative clauses of ver. 6. The verb "shut out," with no determinative qualification annexed, must have it supplied from the unexpressed ground for the "admiration" denoted by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The high eminence of spiritual condition and happiness on the possession of which these men were congratulating their brethren, they would be certainly excluded from if they listened to <span class="accented">them.</span> Compare the phrase, "who are unsettling you," driving you out  of house and home, in ch. 5:12, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might affect them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye may admire themselves.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> makes it emphatic. We may paraphrase thus: that, being detached from regard to my teaching, and made to feel a certain grave deficiency on your own part in respect to acceptableness with God, ye may be led to look up as disciples to these kind-hearted sympathetic advisers for instruction and guidance. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which in ordinary Greek is the present <span class="accented">indicative</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being the form for the present <span class="accented">subjunctive</span>, is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>. When it is considered how punctually St. Paul is wont to comply with the syntactical rule with reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and that these two remarkable deflections therefrom are connected with contract forms of verbs in -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, Ruckert's suggestion seems to be perfectly reasonable, that the solecism lies, not in the syntactical construction, but in the grammatical in flexion, contracting -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3b7;</span> into -<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of into-<span class="greek">&#x1ff6;</span>. This form of contraction may have been a provincialism of Tarsus, or it may have been an idiotism of St. Paul himself. Other expedients of explanation which have been proposed are intolerably harsh and improbable.

In signification, this <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be admired, is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be congratulated, and was illustrated in the first note on ver. 17, especially by the reference to Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188. <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "to be objects of admiration when I am present with you," is manifestly a recital of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the gratulation of yourselves," of ver. 15. The vivid remembrance of the simple-hearted joy and frank sympathy with each other's happiness of those days comes back to the apostle's mind with fresh force, after his brief mention and rebuke of the false-hearted gratulations and compliments by which they were now in danger of being ensnared. With a gentle reprehension of their levity, in that they were now bartering that former well-founded happiness for this later poor gratification of being recipients of mere false flattery, he yearns to bring them back to what they were so senselessly casting away, and that they should hold it fast, a stable joy, whether he was with them or not. This would be the case if "Christ were truly formed in them." The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in what is good," is similar to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>). The sphere in which this admiring felicitation acts must be "what is good;" here that highest good which these Galatians were in danger of losing, if, indeed, they possessed it - being, and knowing themselves to be, sons of God. It is a doubtful point whether ver. 19 should be conjoined with this present verse, with a colon between vers. 19 and 20, and a comma only at the end of ver. 18; or whether the sentences should be separated as they appear in our Authorized Version. But at all events, the earnest, anxious, tender affectionateness which, as it were, wrings the apostle's heart in writing ver. 19, is to be felt already working in his soul in the writing of this eighteenth verse. The sense above given to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, though disallowed by Alford and Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot, appears to be that recognized by the Greek commentators Chrysostom and Theophylact.

The objection to the latter arrangement, presented by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> at the commencement of ver. 20, is thought by many to be obviated by a number of instances which have been alleged in which this conjunction is used with a sentence following a vocative compellation (see Alford, Ellicott). But such cases appear marked by a tone of vivacity and surprise which is not present here. On the other hand, the tone of loving affectionate anxiety breathing in this verse links it more closely with the preceding than with the following one, in which such pathos is no longer discernible, but is replaced by a deliberative attitude of mind. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs as a compellation here only in St. Paul's writings, though repeatedly in St. John's Epistle and once in his Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), where it appears as used by our Lord in an access of deeply moved affectionate-ness. St. Paul addresses Timothy as "his child" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, not only as a term of endearment, but as  denoting also his having been spiritually begotten by him (comp. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Here the like sense attaches to the word, as is clear from the following clause, "of whom I am again in travail;" but the diminutive form of the noun, agreeing well with the notion of a child at its birth, combines in this case apparently a tender allusion also to the extremely immature character of their Christian discipleship .(compare "babes (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) in Christ," <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>) - so immature, in fact, that the apostle is travailing of them afresh, as if not yet born at all. This particular shade of meaning, however, must be sacrificed, if we accept the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my children," which is highly authenticated. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> cannot be understood as pointing to gestation merely; it can only denote the pangs of parturition. The apostle by this figure describes himself as at this hour in an anguish of desire to bring the souls of his converts both to a complete <span class="accented">state</span> of sonship in Christ Jesus, and to a complete <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of that state - now at length bring them thereto, though that former travail had seemingly been in vain. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a> and <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a> he refers to himself as a spiritual <span class="accented">father</span> of his converts, and this too with touching pathos. Great is the pathos too of his reference to himself as, in his fostering care of his Thessalonian converts, like a tender "nursing mother cherishing her own children," and also as of a "father" of them (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7, 11</a>). But neither of those passages equals the present in the expression of intense, even anguished, longing to effect, if only he might be able to effect it, a real transformation in the spiritual character of these Galatian converts. "Until" - I cannot rest till then! - "Christ be formed in you." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, form, occurs only here in the New Testament in its uncompounded shape. A passage is cited from 'Const. Apost.,' 4:7, in which it occurs in the phrase, "formed man in the womb." In the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the unborn infant. It certainly seems as if the apostle used the word as one belonging to the same region of thought as the <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, but, with the like bold and plastic touch as elsewhere characterizes his use of imagery, refusing to be tied to thorough-going consisteney in its application. Compare for example <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>. When the hour of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is come, the period of the" formation" of the babe has expired. Further, as showing the freedom of the writer's use of imagery, the easiest way of taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to suppose that "Christ" is here viewed as "<span class="accented">within"</span> them, and not as a likeness to which they are to be conformed: camp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:22, "Christ liveth in me;" and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, where the "mystery" of the gospel is summed up in the words, "Christ in you the hope of glory." He cannot rest, he means, till the image, thought, of Christ as the Object of their sole and absolute trust, as the complete ground of their acceptance with God and their sonship, shall be perfectly and abidingly formed in their hearts. The hour in which a perfectly formed "Christ," that fair' Divine Child of joy and hope, has come to be there, in their hearts, will be the hour in which the apostle's travailing pangs have issued in their birth. No doubt the apostle is writing to persons baptized into Christ and thus clothed with Christ (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>); persons, in the language of the Church, "born again." But however straitly <span class="accented">we</span> choose to be restrained in the use of such images, solidifying into rigid dogma similitudes used for such passing illustration as the occasion of the moment requires, the sacred writers themselves recognize no such restriction. As Chrysostom observes in his 'Commentary,' the apostle's language in effect is, "Ye need a fresh new-birth, a fresh remoulding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." Baptized into Christ as those Galatians were, they were, however, in his view no true sons of God, until Christ had been really formed in their hearts.

Bishop Lightfoot writes, "<span class="accented">But</span>, speaking of my presence, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would I had been present</span>," etc. But this explanation is not necessary. The imperfect verb <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, denotes a movement as it were which had just been stirring in the mind, but which for good reasons is now withdrawn: "I could almost wish -  but long distance and pressure of other duties make it impossible." Thus much in explanation of the withdrawal of the wish. The wish itself was occasioned by the feeling that the yearning desire of his soul might perhaps be more likely to be achieved if, by being on the spot, he were enabled to adapt his treatment to a more distinct consciousness of the circumstances than he can possibly now have. "To be present with you;" the very words are repeated from ver. 18. It was well both with you and with me when I was with you: would that I could be with van now I (On <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,," this very hour," see note on ch. 1:9.) <span class="cmt_word">And to change my voice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The tense of the infinitive  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> hardly allows us to take the word as meaning "from moment to moment according to the rapidly varying emergencies." This would have been expressed rather by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The question then arises - Change: from what to what? to which a great variety of answers have been proposed. The clue is probably supplied in the words, "be present with you this very hour." This <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, contrasting as it does the very present with the former occasions on which the apostle had been with them, suggests that he meant that the tone of his utterance would need to be different if amongst them just now from what it had then been. Then, it was the simple, un-anxious, joyous, exposition of the blessed gospel, untrammelled by fear of being misunderstood; such a way of speaking as one would be naturally drawn on to pursue who found himself addressing those whom he could confide in, and who were disposed frankly and lovingly, with an honest and good heart, to drink in from his lips the simple faith. Perhaps he might now find it necessary to replace that mode of utterance by guarded words, by stern reasoning, by the refuting of wilful misconceptions, by exposing and abashing cavil and objection. <span class="cmt_word">For I stand in doubt of you</span>; or, I <span class="accented">am perplexed for you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am perplexed about you.</span> Compare <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I am in good courage concerning you" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>). As "<span class="accented">in"</span> the Corinthians the apostle found ground for good courage, so "in" the Galatians he found ground for perplexity. This explains his wishing that he were with them. He would in that case be less unable to clearly understand their state of mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a></div><div class="verse">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). After the outburst of affectionate earnestness expressed in the last four verses, the apostle seems to have paused, reflecting in what way he could the most effectually convince these Galatian legalists of their error. At length, a consideration occurs to him, which he impetuously so to speak hastens to abruptly sot before them. He has before (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>) shown to the Galatian believers that they were "Abraham's seed." He now means to show that, as children of Abraham through faith in Christ, they stood on a far higher footing than the children of the Sinai covenant did - a position which, by subjecting themselves afresh to the Law, they would forego. The verb "desire" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as here introduced, intimates that this aspiration of theirs was a mere freak of self-will, there being nothing in the circumstances to prompt it. So in ver. 9, "Ye desire to be in bondage." In consequence of there being no article with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, some would render <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "under Law," that is, Law viewed <span class="accented">in</span> g<span class="accented">enere</span>, as in <a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. But the whole scope of the Epistle resists this view. The apostle's contention with the Galatian perverters of the truth is not concerning Christians being subject to Law absolutely, but concerning their being subject to a Law of outward ceremonial observance; that is, to the Law of Moses; for there was no other system of positive ordinances by which, as of Divine authority, they could imagine themselves to be bound. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used without the article, like other <span class="accented">monadic</span> nouns with an understood specific reference (for examples, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as it is also <a href="../../par/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not hear the Law?</span> (<span class="greek_word">to\n no/mon</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">to that Law give ye no heed</span>?

There is no reason for attributing to the verb such a sense of listening to an <span class="accented">oral</span> utterance as should warrant us in supposing, that the apostle is thinking in particular of the Galatian Christians as in the habit of "hearing" the Pentateuch and ether Old Testament Scriptures read, whether in Jewish synagogues (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>) or in Christian assemblages. That such Scriptures in the Septuagint Version were customarily read aloud when Christians assembled for united worship, especially in the absence or dearth of other inspired writings, is more than probable: we know from Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1. p. 83) that such was the custom from Sunday to Sunday in his days, when there were <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> also available for such use. Moreover, the existence of such a custom helps us to understand how it was that the apostle could here, as in <a href="../../par/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, presuppose with Christian believers an acquaintance with the contents of the Pentateuch. But we require more here than the thought, "Are ye not wont to hear the Law read?" It is rather an acquaintance with its contents, and taking due account of them, that he demands of his readers. Some uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. This reading of the text would only imply, not without a touch of sarcasm, the sense which the more accredited reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may be understood as directly denoting. The use of the word "Law" to denote at once the system of  Mosaic legislation and the historical record in which it is embedded, is remarkable. The Jews were accustomed to designate the Pentateuch by this term (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and whoever would fain subject themselves to the positive enactments of the Mosaic Law as possessing Divine authority, would of course feel themselves bound also to accept the teaching of the historical record as clothed with the like authority. The apostle himself also accepted both as alike coming from God; only he required that the Divine purpose in both should be clearly understood and be suitably complied with.

Attention has been drawn to other sons born of Keturah (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1, 2</a>), who both in ancient and in modern days (see Windisch-mann) have been very plausibly interpreted as analogously pointing forward allegorically to those heretical bodies, now vanished, which threatened such danger to the Church in the first centuries. But the apostle's concern here is exclusively with the posture of affairs subsisting at the time of Hagar's and Ishmael's expulsion from the patriarch's family, quoted in ver. 30 from <a href="../../par/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. Even if he had seen fit by allegorical exposition to apply Scripture to those dire forms of utterly perverted Christianity, which he certainly did look forward to as about to arise, it is very questionable whether he would have conceded to them so venerable a parentage as having Abraham for their forefather. Mosaism in its place was a thing of Divine origin, even as Christianity itself was, both of them "covenants" of God; not so the monstrous forms of Gnostic and Manichean teaching which horrified the primitive Church. In fact, typology, that is to say, the interpretation of Old Testament Scripture as bearing a <span class="accented">designed</span> allegorical sense, requires very cautious handling. The tracing of analogies is an interesting and pleasing exercise of theological ingenuity; but it is one thing to trace a parallelism, and a quite different thing to detect a latent predictive sense intended by the Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">The one by a bondmaid</span> (<span class="greek_word">e%na e)k th  =   paidi/skh</span>); <span class="accented">one by the handmaid</span>; the expression pointing to the individual mother known from the sacred history. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in classical Greek means a girl either slave or free. In the Septuagint it is generally a slave (not, however, in <a href="../../par/ruth/4-12.htm">Ruth 4:12</a>, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">na'arah</span>); in the New Testament it is always a maidservant. St. Paul borrows the word from the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>. and 21, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">shiphehah.</span> Hagar was the personal property of Sarah. <span class="cmt_word">The other by a freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and one by the freewoman.</span> The word "freewoman" is never applied to Sarah in the story in Genesis; not even in the passage freely quoted in ver. 30; but it was an obviously true description, and with perfect fairness introduced in antithesis to Hagar. As applied to one holding so princessly a position in the story as Sarah, the idea of a freewoman stands coloured with a deep tincture of dignity.

The apostle has evidently in his eye the analogy presented by the natural birth of the Jewish descendants from Abraham, as contrasted with the birth of Abraham's spiritual seed through faith in the promises of the gospel. This point, however, he is content with merely, in vers. 28, 29, glancing at. His main point is the condition of both mother and child in each case, as being either both free or both in bondage. It is not clear whether the apostle by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> meant "born" or "begotten," the verb being used in both senses: but neither is it material. The perfect tense of the verb either supposes us to be as it were present at the time of Ishmael's expulsion, in which case it would mean, "hath been born," or is used with reference to the record in the history, meaning in this case "appears in the story as having been born." So the perfect tense is used also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "According to the flesh" does not precisely mean "in the common course of torture;" the word "flesh" rather contrasts the present visible sphere of human life with the invisible spiritual world, in much the same way as "flesh" is so often contrasted with "spirit." Ishmael was born "after the flesh," <span class="accented">because</span> he was born in the common course of nature; Isaac was born (ver. 28) "after the Spirit," because his birth was connected with the invisible spiritual world "through the promise," which on the one A hand was given by God the great Sovereign of the spiritual world, and on the other was laid hold of and made effectual in that same world of spiritual action by Abraham's and Sarah's faith. But he of the freewoman <span class="cmt_word">was by promise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f76;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but the</span> son <span class="accented">by the freewoman through a promise</span> (or, <span class="accented">through the promise</span>).

This promise was the <span class="accented">means</span> of Isaac's being born, calling forth as it did an acting of faith in God, both in Abraham (<a href="../../par/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-21</a>), and likewise in Sarah (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>), in consideration of which the Almighty beyond the course of nature gave them this child.

The apostle, perhaps, intimates that the particulars just recited by him belong to a class of objects distinguished among other objects presented to us in the Old Testament by having a further sense than the literal historical one; the literal historical sense, however, by no means being thereby superseded. Comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, "Now these things happened unto them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as figures [or, 'by way of figure ']." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is shown by lexicons, Liddell and Scott's and others, to mean, either to <span class="accented">speak</span> a thing allegorically or to <span class="accented">expound</span> a thing as allegorical. Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot furnish passages illustrative of both meanings, particularly of the second; and the latter adds the observation that it is possible that the apostle uses the verb here in the sense of being allegorically expounded, "referring to some recognized mode of interpretation." St. Paul did at times refer to authority extrinsical to his own (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-16.htm">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>). But whichever of the two possible senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was the one here intended by the apostle, there is no improbability in the supposition that not now for the first time was the narrative of Hagar and Ishmael thus applied: it is quite supposable, for instance, that it had been so applied at Antioch, in the animated discussions in which Paul, Barnabas, and Silas encountered the Judaists in that Church. At all events, it is not merely supposable, but in a high degree probable, that at least <span class="accented">some</span> of the historical personages, institutions, and events of the Old Testament Scriptures were wont to be allegorically treated by leaders of Christian thought of the highest authority. We cannot acquiesce in the position adopted by some critics, that such allegorizing is to be relegated to the region of mere Jewish rabbinism, now to be regarded as exploded. And we need not here insist upon the consideration that a rabbinical origin would constitute no valid objection to our acceptance of such allegorizing treatment of Scripture, because that the results of rabbinical exegesis and of rabbinical investigations in theology were in many cases of the highest value - a fact which those who are acquainted, for example, with Professor Reuss's 'Histoire de la Theologie Cbretienne' will not be disposed to question. For we resist the attempt to thrust us back upon the schools of the rabbins, as if it were from them only that St. Paul derived this allegorical method of Scripture exposition. Those schools may have made him acquainted with it, it is true; but altogether independently of rabbinical instruction, the leading teachers of the Church, even before Paul's conversion, "unlearned men," <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as the rabbinists regarded them, had, as we cannot doubt, learnt thus to apply Scripture in the school of Jesus. Christ himself, not only before his passion, but also, and we may believe with greater definiteness and particularity, after his resurrection (<a href="../../par/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), had imparted to his apostles and other disciples <span class="accented">some</span> expositions of historical facts of the Old Testament, which must have been of this description, and which would suggest the legitimate application of the same method in other analogous instances. And those men were not only disciples, pupils of Jesus, but were likewise especial, though not the exclusive, organs of the Holy Spirit's teaching in the Church (<a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-15</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Particular allegorical expositions, therefore, received amongst those apostles and prophets of Christ, came clothed with the highest authority, emanating as they well might have done from Christ's own oral teaching, or from an immediate special leading of his Spirit. And, further, we feel ourselves entitled to believe that the supreme Revealer of spiritual truth to mankind might well think fit to appoint, not only words or ceremonial institutions as means of imparting religious instruction or of prophetical indication, but historical incidents as well; not merely so ordering the manner in which his inspired organs framed their <span class="accented">narratives</span> of certain occurrences as to make those narratives  prophetical, but also in his disposal of human affairs so ordering the occurrences themselves as that <span class="accented">they</span> should be prophetical; furnishing (so to speak) <span class="accented">tableaux vivants</span>, in which the faith of his servants should read, ff not spiritual facts which were as yet future, at least spiritual facts after they had come to <span class="accented">pass</span>, the prophetical adumbration of which, now recognized by them, would serve to confirm their belief in them and their comprehension of them. The fact that Christ repeatedly and most pointedly referred to the strange experiences of Jonah as prophetical of his own passion and resurrection proves to a certainty that events might be predictive as well as utterances of prophets. Our Lord's use of the story of the brazen serpent, of the gift of manna, and of the Passover (<a href="../../par/luke/22-16.htm">Luke 22:16</a>) points in the same direction. We have also apostolical guidance in construing the Passover, the Exodus, the story of Melehiscdec, Abraham's offering up of his son, the yearly Fast of the Atonement, as legitimately subject to similar treatment. Since the old economy with its histories and its ordinances originated from the same Divine Author as the new, it is no unreasonable belief that in the things of preparatory dispensations he had set foreshadowings, and in no scant number, of those great things in the spiritual economy which from "eternal ages" had been his thoughts towards us, and in which the whole progress of human history was to find its consummation. In the apostle's discussion of his subject there are in part distinctly specified, in part merely indicated, a great variety of contrasts; these the reader will find presented by Bengel in his 'Gnomon' in a tabulated form with great distinctness. For these are the two covenants; or, <span class="accented">testaments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for these women are two covenants.</span> The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. but the article is expunged by all recent editors. What the apostle means is this: the circumstance that Abraham had two wives pointed to the fact that there were to be, not one covenant only, but two. He has previously (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15, 17</a>) spoken of "<span class="accented">the</span> promise" as a covenant; while also this term was already a familiar designation of the economy which God appointed to the natural "seed of Abraham." Compare also Jeremiah's mention of these two "<span class="accented">covenants"</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>).

This covenant, with its children, being wrapped in an element of slavery, is kindred in character with Hagar and her offspring. It is objected that Ishmael was not, in fact, a slave. But as Hagar does not appear to have been a recognized concubine of Abraham, in the same way as Bilhah and Zilpah were concubines of Jacob, but still continued to be Sarah's handmaid ("thy maid," <a href="../../par/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>), her child was, of course, born into the same condition. With Sarah's consent, it is true, Abraham might, if he had thought fit, have <span class="accented">adopted</span> him as a child of his own; but this does not appear to have been done. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-25.htm">Galatians 4:25</a></div><div class="verse">For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia</span>. This clause has been the subject of much conflicting opinion. The reading of the Greek text is itself much debated, and in the original authorities (manuscripts, versions, and Fathers) it appears in a great variety of forms. A detailed discussion of the latter point would be out of place here; and for the premisses from which the critical judgment is to be drawn, the reader is referred to Alford, and to a detached note which Bishop Lightfoot adds in his ' Commentary,' at the end of this fourth chapter. Only the main result needs to be stated. There are two forms of the text, between which the choice lies. One is that of the  Textus Receptus, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>," For the <span class="accented">word</span> Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia." This is maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, and San-day. The other, omitting the word <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, runs thus: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">For</span> Sinai is a mountain in Arabia." This is accepted by Bentley, Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf (latterly), Bengel, De Wette, Windischmann, Howson, and Lightfoot. In respect to the original authorities, there is not generally thought to exist any <span class="accented">great</span> preponderance in the evidence for either the retention or the omission of the word "<span class="accented">Hagar."</span> The decision, therefore, depends chiefly upon a comparison of the internal probabilities. In order to this, we must gain as clear a view as we can of the meaning of the above two readings. That of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, according to Chrysostom, as well as modern critics, means this: "For the word Hagar is [represents] in Arabia Mount Sinai." Chrysostom remarks, "<span class="accented">Hagar</span> is the word for Mount Sinai in the language of that country; "and again, "That mountain where the old covenant was delivered, hath a name in common with the bondwoman." Critics make reference to <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, "I went away into Arabia." "It is difficult," <span class="accented">says</span> Dean Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 50." to resist the thought that he [St. Paul] too may have stood upon the rocks of Sinai, and heard from Arab lips the often-repeated <span class="accented">Ha jar</span>, rock, suggesting the double meaning to which the text alludes." But the Arabic word for "rock" <span class="accented">is chajar</span>, differing from <span class="accented">Hajar</span>, the Arabic form of the bondwoman's name, by having <span class="accented">eheth</span> for its initial letter instead of <span class="accented">he.</span> Further, the Arabs would have used the word only as a common noun, "<span class="accented">rock</span>," and not as a proper noun, the <span class="accented">name</span> of the mountain. St. Paul could not have <span class="accented">mistaken</span> the one for the other. There is no evidence at all to substantiate Chrysostom's assertion that the Arabs did name the mountain Hagar; he apparently thought so only because the apostle seemed to him to affirm it. See Lightfoot further on this point. Moreover, the sentence, "The word Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia," is not what St. Paul would have written to express this idea; either, instead of "in Arabia" he would have written "in the language of the country;" or else, "for the Mount Sinai is called Hagar in Arabia." Another objection to this reading is the order in which the words <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> stand. Elsewhere where the words are conjoined the order is, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>. The passages are these: <a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18, 20</a>; 24:26; 31:18; 34:2; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-13.htm">Nehemiah 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>. The reversal of the order here indicates that <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> is the subject, and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> belongs to the predicate; that is, that <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> must be expunged from the text, and that we adopt the other reading, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, "For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia," the well-known land of Hagar and her descendants; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a> (see Mr. Peele's articles on "Hagar" and "Shur" in the 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The article is prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> as having been already just mentioned; as if it were "for this Sina is," etc. The purpose of the clause, however it be read, is plainly to make more colourable the allegorical exposition; it explains why the locality of the giving of the Law has been referred to in the words, "one, from Mount Sinai" - a local specification quite alien to the apostle's usual manner in referring to the old covenant, and only had recourse to here for this particular object. And answereth to (or, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">in the same rank with</span>) Jerusalem which now is (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span>); <span class="accented">and standeth in the same class</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in the same column</span>) <span class="accented">with the Jerusalem that now is.</span> The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> the reader will find amply illustrated in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon.' In the military language of Greece, illustrated out of Polybius, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing in the same <span class="accented">file</span> or column, one behind another (as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing side by side in the same <span class="accented">rank</span>). Hence, as if tabulated on a board, ideas belonging to the same class, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as if placed in a vertical line in column, and so were called <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: whilst ideas belonging to a class contrasted with the former, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as placed horizontally opposite to the former in another column; the two sets of contrasted ideas being <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> to each other. Thus in the present instance we have two columns - <p>Hagar, slave mother; &#8212; Sarah, freewoman. <p>Ishmael, slave child; &#8212; Believers, free children. <p>Covenant from Sinai; &#8212; Promise. <p>Jerusalem that now is; etc. &#8212; Jerusalem that is above; etc. (Compare Erasmus's note in Peele's 'Synopsis.') It is not improbable, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, that St. Paul is alluding to some mode of representation common with Jewish teachers employed to exhibit similar allegories (see Bengel's note above referred to). We may, therefore, conclude that the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, whatever it is, is regarded by the apostle as standing in the same category with the now subsisting Jerusalem, especially in the particular respect which he presently insists upon; namely, as being characterized by slavery. For this is the main point of this whole  allegorical illustration; that Judaism is slavery and the Christian state liberty. It is not clear whether the subject of this verb, "standeth in the same column with," is "the covenant from Mount Sinai," or "Hagar," or "Sinai." If either of the two former, then the first clause of this verse is a parenthesis. The construction runs the most smoothly by adopting the third view, which takes" Sinai" as the subject. Sinai, that gave forth the covenant which is represented by Hagar, "stands in the same column" with "the Jerusalem that now is;" for Sinai is the starting-place of the covenant which has now its central abode in Jerusalem; the people that was <span class="accented">there</span> is now <span class="accented">here</span>; and the condition of slavery into which Sinai's covenant brought them marks them now at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And is in bondage with her children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">for she is in bondage with her children.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by the editors with general consent. That the subject of the verb "is in bondage" is "the Jerusalem that now is," is apparent from the contrasted sentence which next follows, "but the Jerusalem that is above is free." "With her children;" repeatedly did our Lord group Jerusalem with" her children "(<a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-35.htm">Luke 13:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>), having, however, in view the city itself with its inhabitants; while St. Paul probably regards Jerusalem more in idea, as representing Judaism in its central manifestation; "her children" being consequently these who were living under the Law. The apostle here <span class="accented">assumes</span> that this mystical Jerusalem with her children was in bondage, making the fact a ground for identifying her with Hagar. That the fact was so St. Paul knew, both from his own experience and from his observation of others. The religious life of Judaism consisted of a servile obedience to a letter Law of ceremonialism, interpreted by the rabbins with an infinity of hair-splitting rules, the exact observance of which was bound upon the conscience of its votaries as of the essence of true piety. The apostle also probably took account of the slavish spirit which very largely characterized the religious teaching of the ruling doctors of Judaism; their bondage, that is, not only to the letter of the Law, but to the traditions also of men; that spirit which those who heard the teaching of the Lord Jesus felt to be so strongly contrasted by <span class="accented">his</span> manner of conceiving and presenting religious truth. "He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes." But the main point now contemplated by the apostle was bondage to ceremonialism.

This is identical with the "heavenly Jerusalem" of <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, which, standing in contrast with the "mount that might be touched and that burned with fire," Sinai with its soul-crushing terrors, appears associated with the pacifying blood of Jesus, and with communion with all that is holiest and most glorious. The essential identity of the contrast in the two passages, which are mutually illustrative, bespeaks a common origin in one and the same mind. The supernal Jerusalem is not chiefly contrasted with the Jerusalem "that now is," in point of time: she is not the future only, though in the future to be <span class="accented">manifested -</span> the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down (as St. John writes) from God out of heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); but she <span class="accented">is</span> there <span class="accented">now</span>, with God. It would be in harmony with St. Paul's representation to suppose that he conceives of her having been there with God in heaven of old, her citizens upon earth being the true servants of God in all ages. In former ages, however, she was comparatively barren; it needed that the enthronization of the God-Man, "the Mediator of the new covenant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), on "God's holy hill of Zion," should take place before she could become the prolific mother here shown to us. Commentators refer to rabbinical speculations relative to a Jerusalem which was conceived of as existing in heaven, as illustrated by Schottgen's 'Dissertatio de Hierosol. Caelesti' ('Hor. Hebr.,' vol. 1. diss. 5.), and also by Wetstein both here and on <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. It would be interesting if we could determine when those rabbinical speculations first arose, and how far it may be judged probable that they or some earlier form of them out of which these sprang suggested anything to St. Paul for the form in which he clothed his own conception of this idea; there may have been such. Meanwhile, we cannot but be struck by the purely ideal and spiritual character in which the apostle here exhibits his conception of it; though something like a terrene manifestation in the future seems indicated in <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>. "Is free;" the counterpart of Sarah, as mentioned in vers. 22, 23. That this Jerusalem is free, the apostle feels it needless to state; she to his very consciousness is the very home and bosom of God's love, having her  very existence, as well as her outward-acting power, in his pervading, actuating Spirit. Bondage, constraint, <span class="accented">there</span> cannot be; for all volitions are there harmonized, absorbed, by the Spirit of love uniting her component elements both with each other and with God. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the mother of us all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>]) <span class="accented">which is our mother.</span> Here again, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> means "<span class="accented">which</span>, being such as she <span class="accented">is</span>, is our mother." We look at the Jerusalem that is above, and in her princely freedom we recognize what we her children are. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which the Textus Receptus has before <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and which is by the general consent of critics rejected, is with much probability supposed to have come into the text by the copyist's recollection of the similar sentence in <a href="../../par/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16, 17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which there belongs to the essential thought of the context that God had made Abraham "the father of many nations," is unnecessary here, where the apostle is chiefly concerned with the freedom which characterizes the family of promise. If documentary evidence proved it to be genuine, it would find its justification in the notion of the fruitfulness which now at length, as the apostle presently shows, is given to the supernal Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">For it is written, Rejoice, <i>thou</i> barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>). The points indicated in the section of Isaiah (54.) referred to by the quotation which is made of the first verse, and which amply make good what the apostle has been stating and implying, are these: that a new economy was to appear; that by this economy a multitude of servants of God should be called into being; that this multitude should in numbers far surpass those called into being heretofore; that this economy, though newly manifested, had been in existence before, but comparatively unblest with offspring; that it was to be known as an economy of forgiving, adopting love, involving a principle of spiritual life and of spontaneous, no longer constrained and servile, obedience. We need not hesitate in asserting that the last-named features of the new economy were, in the apostle's view, included in the prediction he means to refer to, although not contained in those words of the prophet which he has expressly quoted. For it is one of the characteristics of a Jewish religious teacher's method of citing Scripture, noted by the learned Dr. Biesenthal, himself a Jew, in his 'Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews' ('Einleitung,' p. 54), that he is wont to omit in his express citation more or <span class="accented">less</span> of the passage referred to, leaving it to his hearer or reader to supply the omitted portions from his own knowledge, even when these are most material for the argument; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13, 14</a>, the" oath," fully recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, is not itself contained in the citation made by the writer. The above-named, then, we may assume to have been points which the apostle regarded as contained in the passage he refers to, because they are contained in the section of which the cited words are an integral portion. Whatever may be thought of the applicability, <span class="accented">in a measure</span>, of the prophet's language in the section alluded to, to the case of Israel restored from the Babylonian captivity, yet that such an application furnishes no complete explanation of its import is clear from the circumstance that this jubilant prophesying follows immediately upon the delineation in the preceding chapter of the sufferings of Christ - a delineation which ended with the intimation of the results which should follow in the triumph over mighty powers opposing the Sufferer, and in the work of justification which he would accomplish upon "many" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10-12</a>). That the section was understood by our Lord to refer to the new economy which he was himself to introduce, is evidenced by his citing the words, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord" (ver 13), as pointing to the spiritual illumination which should at the time referred to characterize the people of God universally, so universally that none would be numbered amongst God's true people, that is, amongst the disciples of his Son, who had not "heard from the Father" (<a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). We have, then, in this section of Isaiah a distinctly <span class="accented">predictive</span> description of a condition of spiritual well-being which was to result from Christ's mediation; that is, of the illumination, peace and joyful sense of God's love which then should be the "heritage of the servants of the Lord." This, construed in the apostle's imagery, connecting itself with that of the words which he expressly quotes, is the large multiplication of the children of the freewoman, bringing forth her offspring into a state of freedom and adoption in the great Father's family. The Greek rendering of the passage given by the apostle is identical with that of the Vatican text of the Septuagint. The Alexandrian text varies only in adding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "and be glad," to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "cry." apparently to explain what kind of crying out was intended<span class="cmt_word">.

Perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> may be rendered "her husband." In the prophet's view, the "woman which had her husband" was the visible Israel, possessing the temple and the other tokens of the Lord's dwelling in her midst; the "desolate one" was the spiritual or the ideal Israel to be manifested in the future; for the present out of sight and seemingly in abeyance; but thereafter to he quickened into fertility by the inhabitation of the Lord (for he in the prophet's vision, ver. 5, is the Husband), revealed in his first suffering then glorified Servant as portrayed in the foregoing prophesying. So exactly do these two images correspond with "the Jerusalem that now is" and "the Jerusalem that is above," of the apostle's imagery, that his use of the prophet's words is plainly no mere accommodation to his purpose of language which was in reality alien to the subject, but is the citation of a passage regarded by him as strictly predictive, and therefore probative of the truth of his representation. The view of this prophecy of Isaiah found in Clemens Romanus, Ep. it., 'Ad Corinthians,' &sect; 2, and in Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' p. 88, which regards it as referring to the Gentile Church as contrasted with the Jewish, is plainly a misconception of its import: the rejoicing mother of the prophet, as well as the supernal Jerusalem of the apostle, knows of no distinction in her believing offspring, between Jew and Gentile, comprising both alike.

The apostle is viewing Isaac as in the manner of his being brought into being, the type, to which the children of the mystic freewoman were in after ages to be assimilated. In both cases the children are born or begotten through a promise which God of his own free grace hath given, and which, by an accepting faith, is appropriated and made effectual. Thus Isaac was born (see ver. 23 and <a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8, 9</a>). The children of the supernal Jerusalem are begotten through the gospel, which in effect is a promise of adoption through Christ to be children of God held out to all who will accept it. Obviously the cases differ in this - that in one it was the faith of the parents which made the promise effectual; in the other, the faith of those who in consequence of believing become children. But none the less is it true that the result is due to an announcement proceeding out of God's own free grace - "Not of works but of him that calleth" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7-13</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>). The "promise" is not the parent of the children; this, in the imagery now present to the apostle's mind, is in the antitypal case the mystic Freewoman. The genitive "of promise" is a genitive of qualification, pointing here to the means through which the children are begotten. Compare a somewhat similarly loose use of the genitive in <a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>, "Not the children of the flesh.., but the children of the promise." The case of baptized infants is not in the apostle's view.

(For the phrase, "after," or "according to, the Spirit," see note on ver. 23.) It must be conceded that the apostle somewhat strains the expression in applying it to the case of Isaac; but he does it for the purpose of exhibiting the manner of his birth as homogeneous with that of his antitypes; for these are they of whom it is the more characteristically true; for they are begotten through the Spirit's agency, into the Spirit's kingdom, to be to the uttermost perfected by the Spirit. The imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, was persecuting, points to the scene presented to our view in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, in the midst of which intervenes the injunction," Cast out," etc.; or possibly the apostle regards what then took place as one among other incidents exhibiting the same animus on the part of Ishmael. We cannot doubt that St. Paul points to the word "mocking," which occurs in the passage referred to. At the feast held in honour of Isaac's being weaned, "Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking." The same Hebrew verb is used of insult and disrespect in <a href="../../par/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock <span class="accented">us</span>;" so again ver. 17. The Septuagint, as we now have it, instead of "mocking," has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "at play with Isaac her son;" which would indicate no unkindness on Ishmael's part, but suggest the idea that Sarah's resentment was simply a movement of jealous feeling, roused by her seeing Ishmael assuming a position of equality with a child of hers. But the apostle disregards this interpretation, if indeed the words, "with Isaac her sons" had already then been interpolated into the passage. As those words are not in the Hebrew, the participles lacking any such explanatory adjunct, would fail of itself to express this idea. It is further rendered improbable by the disparity in age between the two lads; for Isaac, having been just weaned, would be only two or three years old, whilst Ishmael would be sixteen or seventeen. It is much more likely that Ishmael, having arrived at these years, participated in Hagar's feelings of jealousy and disappointment that this child should have come to supersede him in the position which, but for this, he might have held in the family; and that, on the occasion of this "great feast," by which the aged pair were celebrating their pious joy ever this "child of promise" as well as very markedly signalizing his peculiar position as Abraham's heir, the elder-born indulged himself in ill-natured and very possibly profane ridicule of the circumstances under which Isaac was born. Hagar's feelings towards her mistress had of old been those of upstart insubordination (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). That both mother and son were very greatly in the wrong is evidenced by the sanction which Heaven accorded to the punishment with which they were visited. The critics (see Wetstein) quote the following passage from the rabbinical treatise, 'Bereshith rabb.,' 53, 15. "Rabbi Asaria said: Ishmael said to Isaac, 'Let us go and see our portion in the field;' and Ishmael took bow and arrows, and shot at Isaac, and pretended that he was in sport." St. Paul's view, therefore, of the import of the Hebrew participle rendered "mocking" is corroborated by the rabbinical interpretation of the word - a consideration which in such a case is of no small weight. The particular word, "persecuted," with which the apostle describes Ishmael's behaviour to his half-brother, was, no doubt, like the expression, "born after the Spirit," suggested by the antitypal case to which he is comparing it. But the features justifying its application to Ishmael viewed as typical were these - spiteful jealousy; disregard of the will of God; antipathy to one chosen of God to be Abraham's seed; abuse of superior power. <span class="cmt_word">Even so it is</span> now (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">even so</span> he <span class="accented">does now.</span> The full sentence represented by this elliptic one is: "even so now does he that is born after the flesh persecute him that is born after the Spirit." This was a fact with which the apostle's experience was but too familiar. In <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor itself, as the Acts abundantly testifies, from city to city had he been dogged by the animosity of the "children of Hagar." No doubt something of this had been witnessed even in the Galatian towns, of the evangelization of which we have no equally full particulars; there, too, we may believe, St. Paul's converts had had to note the abhorrence with which their master was regarded by the adherents of the old religion; and it was natural that this should have a tendency to lessen his hold upon their minds; for were not the Jews the ancient Israel of God, the depositaries of his revelations? Moreover, the hostility which harassed <span class="accented">him</span> would also alight more or less upon <span class="accented">them</span> as being disciples of his (see Jerusalem that is above; etc. Galatians 6:12, and note). All this might make some of them the more ready to listen to Judaizing suggestions. In this verse, therefore, St. Paul is not merely breathing out a sorrow of his own but is fortifying the Galatian believers against a temptation assaulting themselves.

"Nevertheless:" man is acting thus; but, what cloth <span class="accented">God</span> say touching the matter? The similar question in <a href="../../par/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>, "But what saith the answer of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) to him?"  favours the belief that by "the Scripture" the apostle does not mean Scripture in general (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>), but the particular "passage of Scripture" to which he is referring (cf. <a href="../../par/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>). The animation of his tone is that of the triumphant assertion of the Almighty's will as an all-suffering answer to all objections and all discouragements. For "the Scripture" is equivalent to "the utterance of God;" not merely as found in an inspired volume, but because of the circumstances attending upon the speaking of the words (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>: <a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>). They were, indeed, uttered by Sarah; being, however, not words of a simply jealous and petulant woman, but of a righteously indignant matron, whose just, if severe, requirement was enforced upon the reluctant Abraham by God's own express command. The historical fact itself, as thus recorded, was singularly noticeable, standing in a position marking it as peculiarly significant: that it really was a type, prophetical of a certain future spiritual procedure, is ascertained for us by the apostle's exposition. <span class="cmt_word">Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">cast out the handmaid and her son</span>: <span class="accented">for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</span> The Septuagint has "Cast out <span class="accented">this</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) handmaid and her son; for the son of this (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) handmaid shall not inherit with <span class="accented">my son Isaac</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;</span>);" the apostle's citation being literally exact, except that it has not the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (which are not in the Hebrew), and substitutes "the son of the freewoman" for "my son Isaac." His object in these 'changes, which do not in the least affect the substance, is to mark the utterance the more distinctly as God's own voice, speaking of the parties concerned, not as Sarah did, being one of them, but as supreme Ruler and Judge: for the Lord adopted her decision for his own. In respect to Ishmael's exclusion from inheriting, the instance of Jephthah (<a href="../../par/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1, 2</a>), excluded in somewhat similar terms by the legitimate sons of his father ("Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father; for the son of a harlot woman art thou"), does not apply. Hagar was not a "harlot;" but stood <span class="accented">with respect to Sarah</span> in much the same position as did Bilhah and Zilpah to Rachel and Leah. We cannot doubt but that the discrimination made between the two sons, whatever was the character of Sarah's feelings in the matter, is to be ascribed to God's own sovereign appointment (see <a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7, 11</a>). In this terrible sentence, by which Hagar and Ishmael were driven forth beyond the pale of God's most especial guardianship and blessing, the apostle hears the voice of God bidding away from his covenant all who disbelieved the gospel - all, that is, who set aside God's assurances of his tree unmerited love to all who believed in Jesus. It should seem that it was mainly for the purpose of introducing this denunciation that the apostle has been at the pains to trace out the allegorical meaning of the narrative. The apostle is not now thinking of the national excision of the Jews; he is contemplating, not nationalities, but habits of mind - servile legality on the one side, and on the other faith accepting a free gift of grace. It is at their extreme peril, he in effect tells the Galatians, that they forsake the latter to take up with the former: God has shown that by so doing they will forfeit the inheritance altogether.

The following are the probable translations of these several forms of the text: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Therefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: stand fast then in [or, 'by,' or, 'to'] the freedom with which Christ set us free; and do not again get held in a yoke of bondage." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: with freedom did Christ set us free; stand fast, then," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman; in the freedom with which Christ set us free stand fast, then, and," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a hand maid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the free woman by [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'by virtue of'] the freedom [or, 'children of her who is free with that free dora'] with which Christ set us free; stand fast, then, and," etc. It will be seen by the above that there appears a general agreement among recent editors of the Greek text upon three points: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> they all substitute <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> - an alteration which makes no  difference whatever in the sense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they expunge the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they insert <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> are identical except in the punctuation. The construction of the dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is difficult, and has not yet been quite satisfactorily accounted for. We miss the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, to express the idea of <span class="accented">immanence</span> which is evidently intended, and to express which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is elsewhere found present; as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>. The arrangement given in form <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is, in addition, greatly embarrassed by the "then" standing so far on in the sentence - this particle marking, as it does, an inference from the sentence in the preceding verse. The furthest place in the sentence adduced by Winer ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 61) is the fourth word, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>. The fourth form presents by far the easiest construction. It seems strange, however, if this was the original text, that it came to be changed into shapes so much more difficult to construe. In the second form, the clause, "with freedom did Christ set us free," seems somewhat strangely phrased; but this iteration of the idea of freedom, marking the apostle's anxious insistance upon it, may have led the copyists to suspect an error of transcription, and thus have set them upon the endeavour to improve, as they thought, the text before them. The same anxious insistance upon an idea leads the apostle to a somewhat similar introduction of a clause which is almost a parenthesis, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved." It will be noticed that the variations in the text above noted make not the smallest difference in the main contents of thought. The same factors of thought are present in all. The further remarks now to be made will assume for their basis the second form of the text. <span class="accented">Wherefore</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">we are not a handmaid's children</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> children <span class="accented">of the freewoman.</span> This, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> (Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) gathers up the result of the whole foregoing allegorical exposition, not that of its concluding portion only, as a basis for practical remark. "We are not a handmaid's children;" that is, "It is not a slave-girl that is our mother." The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, not because the apostle is thinking, as some imagine, of there being other handmaids besides Mosaism, as, for example, heathen ceremonialism; for the context points to only one slave-girl that can possibly answer to Hagar; but because he wishes by contrast to fasten attention upon the character of her who is our mother. Hence also there is no <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 28. "<span class="accented">But children</span> of the <span class="accented">freewoman</span>," or "of her who is free;" not defining what individual is our mother, but, who our mother is being now assumed as known, marking what her condition is. <span class="accented">With freedom did Christ set us free</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). 'This clause both justifies and explains the word "freewoman." Our mother is a freewoman, because all her children have been emancipated by Christ; and the nature of her freedom is likewise defined by the nature of his work. This sense is more directly asserted in the fourth form of the Greek text - "children of the freewoman by the freedom with which Christ set us free;" but it is in reality contained in the second. Christ's emancipating work was twofold: he at once, by his atonement, effected our deliverance from guilt, and by the manner of his death (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) disconnected his people from the ceremonial Law. The former aspect of his work is essential to the beneficial effect of the latter. The clear realization of the fact that he has effected our perfect reconciliation with God cuts up from its roots all desire even, that we should ourselves strive, either to make or to keep ourselves acceptable with God by obedience to a Law of positive ordinances; while we also must see that, as connected with a Crucified One, it is impossible that we can be in harmony with the Mosaic ritual. A desire to Judaize cannot eoexist with true faith in our crucified Redeemer. By affirming that Christ hath set us free, the apostle points, not merely to our release from real or fancied obligation to obey the Law of Moses, but also to our "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received reconciliation "(<a href="../../par/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>). <span class="accented">Stand fast</span>, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> According to this reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> standing alone receives its colour of reference from the context. So <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. Here it means the steadfast holding to a whole-hearted assurance that in Christ Jesus our freedom is complete. <span class="accented">And do not again get held in a yoke of bondage.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (Herod., 2:121) literally of being caught and held fast by a man-trap; also figuratively of being entangled with perplexities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Herod., 1:190), with a curse, or with guilt, or with arbitrary dicta of a teacher (see Liddell and Scott). The condition of a slave is described by the word "yoke," <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "As many as are bond-servants under the yoke." And it was probably with this particular shade of meaning that St. Peter used the term at the conference at Jerusalem respecting the ceremonial Law (<a href="../../par/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>) - "a yoke which neither we nor our fathers had strength enough to bear;" referring to it, we may suppose, as slavery, not merely because obedience to it was difficult, but as being observed from a legalistic anxiety to approve one's self thereby to the Divine acceptance or to escape the Divine displeasure. This view of the passage explains how the apostle  was able to use the word "again" of these Galatian converts. They had been once under the yoke of an "evil conscience;" but Christ had come to them also, who were "afar off" in Gentile guiltiness, preaching peace, as he had come to them that were "nigh" in the Israelite covenant (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). But if they could not have "peace" and "access to the Father" save through conformity with Mosaic eeremonialism, then their "freedom" was forfeited; they sank back again into their former state of bondage. But see also the note on ver. 9. This exhortation to "stand fast" presupposes that they had not yet lapsed, but were only in danger of it (comp. the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../galatians/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Galatians 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Galatians 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../galatians/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Galatians 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Galatians 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
