This was St. Paul's purpose, as he had written to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>) from Ephesus. He judged it wise, not only with a view to his own safety and that of his companions, but also for the rest and quiet of the Ephesian Church, to take advantage of the lull in the popular storm, and withdraw into quiet waters before any fresh outbreak occurred. Aquila and Priscilla seem to have left Ephesus about the same time, or soon after, since the Epistle to the Romans found them again at Rome (<a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>); and, if the view mentioned in the note to <a href="../../par/acts/19-40.htm">Acts 19:40</a> is true - that in the riot they had saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own - there were probably the same prudential motives for their leaving Ephesus as there were in the case of the apostle.

Bengel and others understand Hellas here of the country between Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, especially Attica; which would make it probable that St. Paul revisited Athens. But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica.

It is not improbable that some at least of there followers were chosen by the Churches to carry their alms to Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-28</a>).

The narrative is so concise that the exact details are matters of conjecture. There is consequently much difference of opinion about them. Howson, with whom Farrar (vol. 2:274) apparently agrees, thinks that the whole party traveled together by land through Bercea and Thessalonica, to Philippi; that the party consisting of Sopater, Aristarchus and Secundus, Gains, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, went on at once from Philippi <span class="accented">via</span> Neapolis, to Troas, leaving St. Paul, who was now joined by St. Luke, at Philippi, to pass eight or nine days there during the Feast of the Passover. And this seems quite consistent with St. Luke's narrative. But Lewin (vol. it. p. 74) thinks that only St. Paul (accompanied, as he supposes, by Luke, Titus, and Jason) went to Macedonia, and that the others sailed direct from Cenchreae to Troas. Renan, on the other hand, thinks they all sailed together from Cenchreae to Neapolis, whence Paul's party went to Philippi, and the others to Troas. There is no clue to the reason why the party thus separated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Tarried</span> for <span class="accented">abode</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; distinctly marking that Luke, the author of the narrative, whom we left at Philippi (<a href="../../par/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13, 14</a>), joined him again at the same place. Renan (p. 498) well remarks, "At Philippi Paul once more met the disciple who had guided him for the first time to Macedonia. He attached him to his company again, and thus secured as his companion in the voyage the historian who was to write an account of it, with such infinite charm of manner and such perfect truth." It may be noted that this passage is quite conclusive against the notion entertained by some, that Timothy was the writer of the Acts. <span class="cmt_word">From Philippi</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from Neapolis, the port of Philippi. <span class="cmt_word">After the days of unleavened bread</span>, which lasted eight days, including the day of eating the Passover. <span class="cmt_word">In five days</span>. An unusually long voyage, owing, doubtless, to unfavorable winds. On the former occasion when he sailed from Troas to Neapolis he was only two days (<a href="../../par/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Where we tarried seven days</span>. As the last of these seven days was Sunday - " the first day of the week" - he must have arrived on the preceding Monday, and left Neapolis on the preceding Thursday. Some, however, reckon the days differently. It must be remembered that the apostle's movements were dependent upon the arrival and departure of the merchant ships by which he traveled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a></div><div class="verse">And upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - We <span class="accented">were gathered</span> for <span class="accented">the disciples came</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">discoursed with</span> for <span class="accented">preached unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">intending</span> for <span class="accented">ready</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prolonged</span> for <span class="accented">continued</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The first day of the week</span>.

This is also an important example of weekly communion as the practice of the first Christians. Comparing the phrase, "to break bread," with St. Luke's account of the institution of the Holy Eucharist (<a href="../../par/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>) and the passages just quoted in <a href="../../par/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, and St. Paul's language (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>), it is impossible not to conclude that the breaking of bread in the celebration of the Lord's Supper is an essential part of the holy sacrament, which man may not for any specious reasons omit. Further, this passage seems to indicate that evening Communion, after the example of the first Lord's Supper, was at this time the practice of the Church. It was preceded (see ver. 11) by the preaching of the Word. The following description, given by Justin Martyr, in his second Apology to Antoninus Plus (or Marcus Aurelius), of the Church assemblies in his day, not a hundred years after this time, is in exact agreement with it: - "On the day which is called Sunday, all (Christians) who dwell either in town or country come together to one place. The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read for a certain time, and then the president of the meeting, when the reader has stopped, makes a discourse, in which he instructs and exhorts the people to the imitation of the good deeds of which they have just heard. We then all rise up together, and address prayers (to God); and, when our prayers are ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president, to the best of his ability, offers up both prayers and thanksgivings, and the people assent, saving 'Amen.' And then the distribution of the bread and wine, over which the thanksgivings have been offered, is made to all present, and all partake of it." He adds that the elements are carried to the absent by the deacons, and that collections are made for poor widows, and orphans, and sick, and prisoners. <span class="cmt_word">Discoursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <a href="../../par/acts/17-17.htm">Acts 17:17</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Prolonged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>).

Anciently the chief city of Ionia, and a most powerful maritime and commercial place, about twenty-eight miles south of Ephesus; though in the time of Homer it was a Carian city. In St. Paul's time it was situated on the south-west coast of the Latmian gulf, just opposite the mouth of the Meander on the east. But since his time the whole gulf of Latmos has been filled up with soil brought down by the river, so that Miletus is no longer on the seacoast, and the new mouth of the Meander is to the west instead of to the east of Miletus, which lies about eight miles inland (Lewin, vol. it. p. 90; Smith's 'Dict. of Geog.'). Miletus was the scat of a bishopric in after times. As regards this visit to Miletus, some identify it with that mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>. And it is certainly remarkable that so many of the same persons in connection with the same places are mentioned in both passages and in the pastoral Epistles generally. The identical persons are Paul, Timothy, Luke, Trophimus, Tychicus, and Apollos (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4, 5</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11, 12, 20</a>); and the identical places are Corinth, Thessalonica, Troas, Ephesus, Miletus, and Crete. But the other circumstances do not agree well with the events of this journey, but seem to belong to a later period of St. Paul's life (see below, ver. 25, note).

Neither does the mention of his life, in the first instance, tally with that of "bonds and afflictions." The T.R., which has considerable support, seems to be far preferable. The first clause, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, means quite naturally," I take no account of anything;" I value nothing, neither liberty, nor ease, nor comfort. I am ready to suffer the loss of all things, and I do count them as dung (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-9</a>); and then he adds yet further, "Neither do I count my own life as precious, so as to accomplish my course," etc. This metaphor of running a race is a favorite one with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To testify the gospel of the grace of God</span>. An invaluable epitome of the Christian ministry. The essential feature of the gospel is its declaration of God's free grace to a guilty world, forgiving sins, and imputing righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The distinctive work of the ministry is to declare that grace. So St. Paul describes his own ministry, and the record of his ministry in the Acts and in his Epistles exactly agrees with this description. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a></div><div class="verse">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">Went about</span> for <span class="accented">have gone</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">kingdom</span> for <span class="accented">kingdom of God</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">I know that ye all</span>, etc. It is a very perplexing question whether St. Paul in this statement spake with prophetic, and therefore infallible, foreknowledge, or whether he merely expressed the strong present conviction of his own mind, that he should never return to Asia again. The question is an important one, as the authenticity of the pastoral Epistles is in a great measure bound up with it. For, in the apparent failure of all hypotheses to bring the writing of them within the time of St. Luke's narrative, prior to St. Paul's journey to Rome, we are driven to the theory which places the writing of them, and the circumstances to which they allude, to a time subsequent to St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome. But this involves the supposition that St. Paul returned to Ephesus after his release from his Roman imprisonment (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9-14, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), and consequently that St. Paul's anticipation, that he was in Asia for the last lime, was not realized. The question is well discussed by Alford, in the 'Prolegomena to the Pastoral Epistles,' and in Paley's 'Horae Paulinae,' <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>. But it can hardly be said to be definitively settled (see above, note to ver. 15). Bengel thinks the explanation may be that most of those present were dead or dispersed when Paul returned some years later.

Now follows the weighty charge of this great bishop to the clergy assembled at his visitation. With the true feeling of a chief pastor, he thinks of the whole flock, but deals with them chiefly through the under-shepherds. If he can awaken in these individually a deep concern for the souls committed to their charge, he will have done the best that can be done for the fleck at large. The first step to such concern for the flock is that each be thoroughly alive to the worth and the wants of his own soul. "Take heed unto yourselves." He that is careless about his own salvation will never lie careful about the souls of others (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the Holy Ghost</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, no doubt, does not strictly contain the idea of "over which;" but the idea of authoritative oversight is contained in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and therefore the rendering of the A.V., and of Alford's A.V. revised, is substantially correct.

St. Peter applies the titles of "Shepherd and Bishop of souls" to the Lord Jesus (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>).

Meyer, too, thinks that the external evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is decisive, and that the internal evidence from the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> Occurs nowhere else in St. Paul's writings, is decisive also. But on the other hand, both the Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaitieus (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), the two oldest manuscripts, have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c5;</span>). The Vulgate, too, and the Syriac have it; and such early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, "the blood of God," which seems to have been derived from this passage. And Alford reasons powerfully in favor of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, dwelling upon the fact that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> occurs <span class="accented">ten times</span> in St. Paul's writings, that of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> not once.

It should be added that the evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf, in 1563, of rite Codex Sinaiticus, and in 1867 of the Codex Vaticanus, from his own collation. The result is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> seems to be the true reading (see the first of the two collects for the Ember weeks in the Book of Common Prayer. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of God," and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct "<span class="accented">blood</span> of <span class="accented">God</span>," which Athanasius and others objected to. The mental insertion of "the Lord" or "Christ," as the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">purchased</span>," is very easy, the transition from God the Father to God incarnate being one that might be made almost imperceptibly. Others (including the R.T.) take the reading of several good manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to be an ellipse for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the phrase used in <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; and so render it "<span class="accented">which</span> he purchased by the blood of his own Son." <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, his own, is used without a substantive in <a href="../../par/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.

The night is mentioned first, in accordance with Hebrew usage (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5, 8, 13</a>, etc.; comp. the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>) St. Paul enforces the word "Watch," so appropriate to shepherds who watch over their flocks by night (<a href="../../par/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>), by his own example of admonishing by night as well as day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a></div><div class="verse">And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- Now</span> for <span class="accented">now brethren</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the inheritance</span> for <span class="accented">an inheritance</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I commend you to God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). A most beautiful and significant phrase! The apostle is leaving for ever the flock which he had fed with such devoted care and loved with such a fervent love. He was leaving them with a strong impression of the dangers to which they would be exposed. To whom could he entrust them? to what loving hands could he consign them? He gives them to God, to take watchful custody of them. He brings them to him in the prayer of faith. He commits to him the precious deposit (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>), to be preserved safe unto the day of Christ. So the Savior of the world, when dying on the cross, said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit "(<a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), and then trustingly gave up the ghost (see too <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). No less beautiful are the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And to the word of his grace</span>. He was thinking of the grievous wolves, and of their pernicious doctrine; of the deceivers that should arise, and their soul-destroying heresies; and so he turns to the one source of safety "the Word of God's grace in Jesus Christ." If they are kept in that Word of truth, if they nourish their souls with that sincere milk, they will be safe. The gospel which he had preached would be their safety unto the end. It would build them up on the one Foundation which never can be moved; it would preserve them holy to take possession of the inheritance of the saints in light. <span class="cmt_word">The inheritance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; and Ephesians 1:11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>.

But perhaps its force here is equivalent to the phrase in <a href="../../par/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7d;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you," as the R.V. takes it. <span class="cmt_word">So laboring</span>; viz. as ye have seen me do. <span class="cmt_word">To help the weak</span>. Meyer, following Bengel and others, understands this to mean the weak in faith," like <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. They say that St. Paul's self-denial in refusing the help he had a right to claim as an apostle, and supporting himself by his labor, was a great argument to convince the weak in faith of his disinterestedness and of the truth of his gospel, and so he recommends the elders of the Church to follow his example. But the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> rather suggest the idea of bodily weakness (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>, etc.), and the words of the Lord Jesus which follow suggest almsgiving to the needy. So that it is better to understand the word of the weakly and poor, those unable to work for themselves. Doubtless St. Paul, out of his scanty earnings, found something to give to the sick and needy. The sentiment in our text is thus exactly analogous to the precept in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>. The very word there used, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 34. <span class="cmt_word">To remember the words of the Lord Jesus</span>. This is a solitary instance era saying of our Lord's, not recorded in the Gospels, being referred to in Scripture. There are many alleged sayings of Christ recorded in apocryphal Gospels or in the writings of Fathers as Papias and others (Routh, 'Reliq. Sac.,' 1:9, 10, 12), some of which may be authentic; but this alone is warranted by Scripture. How it came to St Paul's knowledge, and that of the Ephesian elders to whom he seems to have taken for granted that it was familiar, it is impossible to say. But it seems likely that, in those very early days, some of the Lord's unwritten words may have floated in the memory of men, and been preserved by word of mouth. Clement (1 Corinthians it.) seems to refer to the saying when he writes in praise of the former character of the Corinthians, that they were then <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. But he probably had it from the Acts of the Apostles, as had the author of the 'Apostol. Constitut.' (4. 3, 1). Similar apophthegms are quoted from heathen writers, as those cited by Kuinoel: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Artemidor., 'Onirocr.,' 4, 3); <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> (Arist., 'Nieom.,' 4, 1), "It is more becoming to a free man to give to whom he ought to give, than to receive from whom he ought to receive."
