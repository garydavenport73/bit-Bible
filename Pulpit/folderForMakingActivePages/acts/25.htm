But the reading of the T.R., "the high priest," is more in accordance with <a href="../../par/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>, and is approved by Alford. The high priest at this time was no longer Ananias, but Ismael the son of Phabi, who was appointed by King Agrippa towards the close of Felix's government (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8). He went to Rome to appeal to Nero about the wall which the Jews had built to screen the temple from being overlooked, and which Agrippa had ordered to be pulled down; and being detained at Rome as a hostage, he was succeeded in the high priesthood by Joseph Cabi the son of Simon. We may feel sure that on this occasion he was present before Festus, for he had not yet gone to Rome. <span class="cmt_word">Informed him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="../../par/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">The principal men of the Jews</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>).

The question arises as to whether the two phrases are identical in their meaning. Meyer thinks that the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> includes leading men who were not elders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not Sanhedrists.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/25-4.htm">Acts 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly <i>thither</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Howbeit</span> for but.

Festus did not merely mention the fact, which the Jews knew already, that Paul was a prisoner at Caesarea, but his determination to keep him there till he could go down and try him. The A.V. gives the meaning. Either <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to be understood, as if Foetus should say, "Paul is a Roman citizen; Caesarea is the proper place for him to be tried at before the procurator, and therefore he must be kept in custody there," or some such words as, "I have given orders" must be understood before "that Paul should be kept."

The accusations against him fell under these three heads (<a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>): he was the ringleader of an unlawful sect; he had profaned the temple; and he had stirred up insurrection against the government among the Jews. The accusations were false under every head. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/25-9.htm">Acts 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Desiring to gain</span> favor <span class="accented">with the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">willing to do the Jews a pleasure</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To gain favor</span>, etc. (see above, <a href="../../par/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>, note). It was not unnatural that Festus, ignorant as he still was of Jewish malice and bigotry and violence, in the case of Paul, and anxious to conciliate a people so difficult to govern as the Jews had showed themselves to be, should make the proposal. In doing so he still insisted that the trial should be before him. <span class="cmt_word">Before me</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as <a href="../../par/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a> and Acts 26:2; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "before thee," viz. King Agrippa in the last case, and Felix in the former. The expression is somewhat ambiguous, and may merely mean that Festus would be present in the court to ensure fair play, while the Sanhedrim judged Paul according to their Law, and so Paul seems, by his answer, to have understood it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/25-10.htm">Acts 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - But <span class="accented">Paul said</span> for <span class="accented">then said Paul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I am standing</span> for <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">stand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">at</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">thou also</span> for <span class="accented">thou</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>). The judgment-seat of the procurator, who ministered judgment in Caesar's name and by his authority, was rightly called "Caesar's judgment-seat." As a Roman citizen, Paul had a right to be tried there, and not before the Sanhedrim. The pretence that he had offended against the Jewish Law, and therefore ought to be tried by the Jewish court, was a false one, as Festus well knew; for he had the record of the preceding trial before him.

St. Paul saw at once the danger he was in from Festus's inclination to curry favor with the Jews. With his usual fearlessness, therefore, and perhaps with the same quickness of temper which made him call Ananias "a whited wall," he said, "No man (not even the mighty Roman governor) may make me over to them at their request, to please them," and with the ready wit which characterized him, and with a knowledge of the rights which the <span class="accented">Lex Julia</span>, in addition to other laws, conferred on him as a Roman citizen, he immediately added, I appeal unto Caesar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/25-12.htm">Acts 25:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Thou hast</span> for <span class="accented">hast thou?</span> A.V. and, as far as punctuation is concerned, T.R. <span class="cmt_word">The council</span>.

In like manner, Pliny (quoted by Kuinoel) says of certain Christians who had appealed to Caesar, that, "because they were Roman citizens, he had thought it right to send them to Rome for trial" ('Epist.,' 10:97). Festus, though, maybe, rather startled by Paul's appeal, was perhaps not sorry to be thus rid of a difficult case, and at the same time to leave the Jews under the impression that he himself was willing to send the prisoner for trial to Jerusalem, had it been possible.

He was only seventeen at his father's death, and so not considered by Claudius a safe person to entrust his father's large dominions to. But he gave him Chalets, and afterwards, in exchange for it, other dominions.

Augustus</span> was the title conferred by the senate upon Octavius Caesar,  <span class="date">B.C. 27</span>, whom we commonly designate <span class="accented">Augustus Caesar.</span> It became afterwards the distinctive title of the reigning emperor, and, after the end of the second century, sometimes of two or even three co-emperors, and was now berne by Nero.

It is spoken of all holy things, temples and the like, "Et queocunque sua Jupiter auget ope" (Ovid, 'Fast.,' 1:609); and, as Ovid says in the same passage, is a title proper to the gods. For, comparing it with the names of the greatest Roman families, Maximus, Magnus, Torquatus, Corvus, etc., their names, he says, bespeak human honors, but of Augustus, he says, "Hie socium summo cum Jove nomen habet." And so the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> bespeaks a veneration closely akin to adoration. <span class="cmt_word">Caesar</span>, originally the name of a family of the Juliagens, became the name of Octavius Caesar Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Caesar; then of Tiberius, as the adopted son of Augustus; and then of the successors of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who had by descent or adoption some relationship to C. Julius Caesar the great dictator. After Nero, succeeding emperors usually prefixed the name of Caesar to their other names, and placed that of Augustus after them. AElius Verus, adopted by Hadrian, was the first person who bore the name of Caesar without being emperor. From this time it became usual for the heir to the throne to bear the name; and later, for many of the emperor's kindred to be so called. It was, in fact, a title of honor conferred by the emperor.
