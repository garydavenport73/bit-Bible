A glance at the map will show that Caesarea (see note to <a href="../../par/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>) was but a short distance, some thirty miles, from Joppa. It was doubtless with a view to Peter's momentous errand to Caesarea that Luke recorded his previous visit to Lydda and his residence at Joppa, consequent upon the restoring of Dorcas to life: the <span class="accented">origines</span> of Gentile Christianity being the prime object of the Acts (see Introduction to the Acts). <span class="cmt_word">The Italian band</span>; or, <span class="accented">cohort</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, or cohort, was used in two <span class="accented">senses.</span> When spoken of strictly Roman troops, it meant the tenth part of a legion, and consisted of from four hundred and twenty-five to five hundred or six hundred men, according to the strength of the legion. Its commander was called a chiliarch, and it was divided into centuries, each commanded by a centurion. But when spoken of auxiliary provincial troops, it meant a regiment of about a thousand men (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 3:42). It is in this last sense probably that it is used here. Josephus, in the passage above quoted, speaks of five such auxiliary cohorts coming from Caesarea to join Vespasian's army, and he tells us in another place ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:18, 7) that the principal portion of the Roman army at Caesarea were Syrians. It is pretty certain, therefore, that the Italian cohort here spoken of were auxiliaries, so called as being made up in whole or in part of Italians, probably volunteers or <span class="accented">velones</span> (Farrar, vol. 1:278, note). Another reason for this conclusion is that it does not seem likely that one of the <span class="accented">divisions</span> of a legion should have a name (though it was very common for the legions themselves to be distinguished, in addition to their number, prima, secunda, decima, etc., by such names as Italics, Parthica, Augusta, etc.), but that separate regiments would naturally have appropriate names for the same reason that the legions had. Thus, besides the Italian cohort here named, we have the Augustan cohort in <a href="../../par/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>. It might be important for the security of the procurator, in so turbulent a province as Judaea, to have at least one cohort of Italian soldiers at the seat of government. Renan ('Apotres,' p. 202) thinks the full name of the cohort may have been "Cohors prima Augusta Italica civium Romanorum;" and adds that there were in the whole empire not fewer than thirty-two cohorts bearing the name of <span class="accented">Italian.</span>

It is an interesting question as to what was the precise religions status of Cornelius, whether he was a proselyte in any technical sense. But the whole narrative, in which he is spoken of simply as a Gentile and uncircumcised, seems to indicate that, though he had learnt from the Jews to worship the true God, and from the Jewish Scriptures read or heard in the synagogue to practice those virtues which went up for a memorial before God, yet he was in no sense a proselyte. It is pleasant to think that there may have been many such in the different countries where the Jews were dispersed (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>, and probably <a href="../../par/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a>).

It was, as Meyer says, a clear angelic appearance; there was no indistinctness or confusion about it, and consequently it left no kind of doubt in the mind of Cornelius. <span class="cmt_word">An angel</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">the angel</span>; the addition <span class="cmt_word">of God</span> defines it (see <a href="../../par/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>, note).

Applied to a man, it denotes that state in which the external senses and the volition are suspended, and all his impressions are derived from within (see <a href="../../par/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>). It is also used to express great astonishment (<a href="../../par/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-10.htm">Acts 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-42.htm">Mark 5:42</a>). In the LXX. of <a href="../../par/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a> it is spoken of Adam's <span class="accented">deep sleep</span>, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/27-33.htm">Genesis 27:33</a> of Isaac's <span class="accented">exceeding trembling</span>, and elsewhere of strong emotions.

The vessel coming down from the open heavens implied that the command to eat what was contained in it was given by revelation. The things sent were from God, and the command to eat was from God. Peter's hunger had prepared the way for the particular form of the vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/10-12.htm">Acts 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Beasts and creeping things of the earth</span> for <span class="accented">beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">heaven</span> for <span class="accented">air</span>, A.V.

Peter's astonishment must, therefore, have been exceeding great at the command to slay and eat. And so his answer in ver. 14 shows. And yet our Lord had taught him the same truth (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>, or still more distinctly <a href="../../par/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-23</a>).

It is rather a striking testimony to Peter's religious character as a Jew before his call to the apostolate, that, poor Galilaean fisherman as he was, unlearned and ignorant, he had yet always conscientiously obeyed the Law of Moses in regard to things clean and unclean (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-15</a>). The address, <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>), seems certainly to recognize the voice as that of Christ, which also agrees with the descent of the vessel from heaven.

The same word is rendered <span class="accented">entertained</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which is nearer the sense; "to entertain as a guest." The word carries with it that he showed them hospitality, and thus broke down the wall of partition between him and them. "He gave them friendly treatment, and made them at home with him" (Chrysostom). (For <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, see ver. 32.) <span class="cmt_word">He arose and went forth</span>.

It was notorious among the Romans that the Jews kept themselves aloof from other people. Hence the accusation against them, in common with Christians, of being haters of the human race. Tacitus says of them that they hated all people, except their own countrymen, as their enemies, and refused to eat or intermarry with them ("Separati epulis discreti cubilibus;" 'Hist.,' 5:5).

As regards the truth that <span class="cmt_word">God is no respecter of persons</span>, which the present incident had brought home so vividly to Peter's apprehension, there can be no difficulty in understanding it. Cornelius was devout, he feared God, he was fruitful in prayer and almsgiving. God did not say to him, "All this would have been accepted in a Jew, but cannot be noticed in a Gentile." But, Gentile as he was, his prayers and alms went up for a memorial before God. If the things done were good in themselves, they were equally good whoever did them.

The words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are synonymous, as in ver. 44 and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23, 25</a> (see <a href="../../par/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>), and are better both expressed by the English <span class="accented">word</span>, as in the A.V., than by <span class="accented">word and saying</span>, as in the R.V.

A good example of its force is <a href="../../par/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13</a>, and of the substantive <a href="../../par/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>. It means "to rule over oppressively, and by force." In the explanatory addition, <span class="cmt_word">For God was with him</span>, Peter teaches what our Lord himself and St. John in his Gospel so constantly do, that our Lord's miracles were wrought by the power of God (see e.g. <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>, etc.).

This constant reference to the testimony of eye-witnesses is an indication of the thoroughly historical character of Christianity, and of the importance of Christian evidences. The new matter which Peter was to bring before Cornelius and his company begins at ver. 40, but with the prefatory remarks in ver. 39, which both attest the truth of what Cornelius already knew and prepare for the following revelation. <span class="cmt_word">Who did eat and drink</span> (see <a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30, 41-43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>, etc.).

It is easy to see how the creeds would be formed from the repetition of short doctrinal statements like this (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3, 4</a>).

Here we have another article of the Creed, the forgiveness of sins, preached too in immediate anticipation of baptism, on the profession of faith in Jesus Christ (ver. 48). Comp. <a href="../../par/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a> (T.R.) and 38.

A more striking confirmation of Peter's vision cannot be conceived than this descent of the Holy Ghost upon the uncircumcised.
