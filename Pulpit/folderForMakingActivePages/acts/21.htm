"Non sine desiderio magno" (Bengel). "He shows the violence of the parting by saying, ' Having torn ourselves away '" (Chrysostom).

In 2 Macc. 12:10 it means simply" withdrawn," and so perhaps also in <a href="../../par/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>, though Meyer thinks that St. Luke chose the unusual word to denote the urgent emotion by which our Lord was as it were compelled to leave the companionship of the apostles, and be alone. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> (whence spasm) and its derivatives, of which Luke uses four - two of which are peculiar to him - are much employed by medical writers, as Hippocrates, Galen, Antaeus, etc. (Hobart, on <a href="../../par/luke/22.htm">Luke 22</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Had set sail</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>).

The same conception of putting out to sea being a going up, led to the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (high up) being applied to ships out at sea. From <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes, of course, our word "meteor." <span class="cmt_word">Cos</span>, or <span class="accented">Coos</span>, for it is written both ways, now called by the Turks <span class="accented">Stanko</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1ff6;</span>), a beautiful island, nearly opposite the Gulf of Halicarnassus, and separated from Cnidus by a narrow strait, about six hours' sail from Miletus. There is a city of the same name on its eastern coast. It was one of the six Dorian colonies which formed the confederation called the Dorian Hexapolis. It was famous for its wine and its textile fabrics (Howson, and Lewin, and 'Dict. of Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Rhodes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); perhaps the "Isle of Roses;" the well-known mountainous island in the AEgean Sea, which lies nine or ten miles from the coast of Carts. Its inhabitants were Dorians, and it was one of the places which claimed the honor of being the birthplace of Homer. The towns are all situated on the seacoast, "Rhodes was the last Christian city to make a stand against the Saracens" (Howson). <span class="cmt_word">Patara</span> ([<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). A flourishing commercial city on the south-west coast of Lycia, with a good harbor. It was the port of Xauthus, the capital of Lycia. The name <span class="accented">Patera</span> is still attached to some extensive ruins on the seashore not far from the river Xanthus.

The ship in which St. Paul and his companions had hitherto sailed was probably a coasting-vessel, intending to continue its course all along the south coast of Asia Minor. But at Patara they found a ship on the point of sailing across the open sea direct to Tyre, by which the voyage would be shortened many days. They accordingly immediately took their passage by it, and put out to sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 1, note). A glance at the map will show what a great corner was thus cut off. A straight line from Patara to Tyro leaves Cyprus just on the left. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/21-3.htm">Acts 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">come in sight of</span> for <span class="accented">discovered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">leaving it... we sailed</span> for <span class="accented">we left it... and sailed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had come in sight of</span>; literally, <span class="accented">had been shown Cyprus</span>; had had Cyprus made visible to us; <span class="accented">i.e. had sighted Cyprus.</span> It is a nautical expression. Meyer compares the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> for the grammatical construction. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is peculiar to St. Luke, occur-tug elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>. It is, however, used repeatedly in the LXX. of Job. <span class="cmt_word">Landed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, T.R., just the opposite to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2; but the R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, with the same meaning, "we came to shore." <span class="cmt_word">At Tyre</span>, which they may have reached in about forty-eight hours from Patara with a fair wind (Howson). Tyre at this time was still a city of some commercial importance, with two harbors, one north and one south of the causeway which connected the island with the mainland (see <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Howson thinks the ship in which St. Paul sailed may have brought wheat from the Black Sea, and taken up Phoenician wares in exchange. The sight of Cyprus as he sailed by must have brought many and very various memories to the apostle's mind, of Barnabas, of Sergius Paulus, of Elymas, and many others.

R.V. Hence some would render the passage here "when we had refitted (the ship) during these days." But this is a very harsh construction, and it is better, with the glossaries, lexicons, the Vulgate, and most commentators, to take the word here in the unusual sense of "to complete," applied to time. <span class="accented">The days</span> are the seven days mentioned in ver. 4, which were probably determined by the time it took to unlade the ship and get the new cargo on board.

It lies on the north side of the spacious bay of Carmel, but is not in all weathers very safe harborage. It is an easy day's sail, under thirty miles, from Tyre.

His old home at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) had been broken up by the persecution (<a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>), and thus the deacon had become an evangelist (<a href="../../par/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>). <span class="accented">Evangelists</span> are mentioned by St. Paul(<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>) as one of the higher orders of the Christian ministry; and Timothy is bid "do the work of an evangelist" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>).

On the office of prophets in the early Church, see <a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-6.htm">1 Corinthians 14:6, 29</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a> (see Alford, on <a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>). As regards these daughters of Philip, there are conflicting statements in early Church writers. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 3:30) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that both Peter and Philip among the apostles were married and had children, and that Philip moreover gave his daughters in marriage to husbands. But in the next chapter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he quotes Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus at the end of the second century, as saying that Philip the apostle and his two daughters, who had grown old in their virginity, were buried at Hierapolis; and that another daughter of his, "who had her conversation in the Holy Spirit," was buried at Ephesus. Eusebius himself thinks that these daughters of Philip the evangelist were meant. If they were, it does not necessarily follow that those who, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, were married were of the four mentioned here. They might be sisters. Polycrates seems to speak of three sisters who lived a religious life (in the technical sense); the fourth may have died young. But it is quite possible that Clemens may really be speaking of Philip the apostle, and Polycrates also; the more so as Philip the apostle, according to the tradition recorded by Nicephorns, suffered martyrdom at Hierapolis. However, the confusion between the two Philips is quite certain in the Menaeum (or Calendar) of the Greek Church, where we read, "On the 4th of September is the commemoration of Saint Hermione, one of the four daughters of the Apostle Philip, who baptized the eunuch of Candace. She and her sister Eutychis came into Asia after the death of the Apostle John. She was buried at Ephesus." A fragment of Caius (in Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3:31) increases the confusion by speaking of" the four daughters of Philip, prophetesses, who were buried in Hierapolis" (see Routh's 'Reliq. Sac.,' vol. 1. pp. 378-380).

What was the particular form by which a person who wished to associate himself with others under a Nazaritic vow (note on ver. 24) did so is not known; nor how long before the expiration of the vow such association must be made. But from the mention of "seven days" in ver. 27 (which is the number named in <a href="../../par/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9</a>, in case of an accidental uncleanness), it seems highly probable that "seven days" was the term during which a person must have conformed to the Nazaritic vow to entitle him to "be at charges," as well, perhaps, as the time during which Nazarites, at the end of their vow, had to undergo special purification. <span class="cmt_word">Declaring the fulfillment</span>, etc. The vow of the four men had been for at least thirty days (the minimum period of such vow); but whatever length of time it had been for, such time would have expired by the end of the seven days, and probably long before. We know not how long they might have been waiting for some one to "be at charges" for them, and provide the sacrifices, without which they could not shave their heads and accomplish their vow. But it is obvious that some notice must be given to the priests in the temple of the day when one or more Nazarites would present themselves at "the door of the tabernacle of the congregation," to offer the prescribed offerings. And this accordingly Paul and the four did. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> means "notifying," or "declaring," to the priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> [LXX., answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>]; <a href="../../par/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>; Joshua 6:9, LXX. [Joshua 6:10, A.V., "bid"]). <span class="cmt_word">Until the offering was offered</span>, etc. This is interpreted in two ways. Meyer makes "until" depend upon "the fulfillment of the days," so as to define that fulfillment as not taking place till the offering was offered. Wieseler makes "until" depend upon "he entered into the temple," with the idea supplied, "and remained there," or "came there daily;" supposing that it was the custom for Nazarites to finish up their time of separation by passing the last seven days, or at least being present daily, in "the court of the women, where was the apartment appropriated to the Nazarites" (Lewin, it. p. 142). If, however, with Howson, Lewin and others, we understand the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in vers. 24 and 20, not generally of taking the Nazarite vow, but of certain special purifications at the close of a Nazaritic vow, which lasted seven days immediately before the offerings were made and the head shaven, then a very easy and natural rendering of the words follows: "Notifying their intention of now completing the seven days of their purification, until the offering for each of them was offered." Alford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., justifies by examples the aorist indicative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, instead of the subjunctive, which is more usual. Lewin thinks that St. Paul had taken a Nazaritic vow after his escape from death at Ephesus, or at Corinth; but there is no evidence of this, and it is hardly consistent with James's advice. Renan thinks it doubtful whether or no Paul took the Nazaritic vow at all, but inclines to this as the best interpretation ('St. Paul,' p. 518, note).

Alford quotes the description of the fort Antonia in Josephus, 'Bell.

That at the southeast angle rose to an elevation of seventy cubits, so that from thence there was a complete view of the temple. Where it adjoined the colonnades of the temple it had passages leading down to both, through which the guards - for in the fortress there always lay a Roman legion - descended and disposed themselves about the colonnades in arms at the festivals, to watch the people, and repress any insurrectionary movement."

In the only two other places were it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-12.htm">Galatians 5:12</a>) it is transitive. It is not a classical word. <span class="cmt_word">The four thousand men</span>. Josephus, in the above-cited passage, reckons the followers of the Egyptian impostor at above thirty thousand. But such discrepancies are of no account, partly because of the known looseness with which numbers are stated, and Josephus's disposition to exaggerate; partly because of the real fluctuation in the numbers of insurgents at different periods of an insurrection; and partly because it is very possible that a soldier like Lysias would take no count of the mere rabble, but only of the disciplined and armed soldiers such as these Sicarii were. It may be added that Josephus himself seems to distinguish between the rabble and the fighting men, because, though in the 'Bell. Jud.,' it. 13:5 he says that Felix attacked or took prisoners "most of his followers," in the 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:6 he makes the number of slain "four hundred," and of prisoners "two hundred" - a very small proportion of thirty thousand. The Egyptian had premised his deluded followers that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down like those of Jericho. It is not known exactly in what year the insurrection took place, but it was, as Renan says, "pen de temps auparavant" ('St. Paul,' p. 525). The Egyptian himself contrived to run away and disappear; hence the thought that he was the author of this new tumult at Jerusalem. The Sicarii were a band of fanatical murderers, who, in the disturbed times preceding the destruction of Jerusalem, went about armed with daggers, and in broad daylight and in the public thoroughfares murdered whoever was obnoxious to them. Among others they murdered the high priest Jonathan at the instigation of Felix (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 6:7; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2, 13:3).
