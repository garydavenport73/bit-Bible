In two years more the temple was finished (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>), and the work of rebuilding was now proceeding vigorously; it seemed a fit opportunity for inquiring whether, in this period of comparative prosperity and success, it behoved the people to continue the fast appointed in sadder times. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord came.</span> This is the usual formula for introducing a revelation (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>), but it is here placed in a peculiar position, dividing the date into two parts. Keil connects the last clause, which gives the day of the month, with the next verse; but this is against the traditional accentuation, and is not required by the wording of ver. 2. The prophet first gives the date generally when the word came to him, and then defines it more accurately. <span class="cmt_word">Chisleu</span>; <span class="accented">Chislev</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>).

But the temple is never called <span class="accented">Beth-el</span>, while a mission to the town Bethel would be unmeaning. So "Bethel" is to be taken as the subject of the sentence, thus: "Now Bethel (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they of Bethel) sent." The persons named may be taken either as the deputation or as the persons meant by "they of Bethel." The former seems most likely to be intended. The Bethelites sent these men to Jerusalem to make the inquiry. The exiles returned each to his own city, as we read in Ezra it.; among them were many people of Bethel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>), which town they rebuilt (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>). They seem to have tacitly acquiesced in the spiritual supremacy of Jerusalem, notwithstanding the associations Connected with their own city. <span class="cmt_word">Sherezer</span>. The names of the deputies are Assyrian; they seem to have retained them on their return. <span class="accented">Sherezer</span>, equivalent to Assyrian <span class="accented">Sar-usur</span> or <span class="accented">Asur-sar-usur</span>, "Asur protect the King," is the name borne by a sen of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Regem-melech</span>; "Friend of the King." The first half of the word is probably Assyrian (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschr. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 206, 417). <span class="cmt_word">And their men</span>. Certain persons associated with them in the business. <span class="cmt_word">To pray before the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to stroke the face of the</span> Lord (<a href="../../par/zechariah/8-21.htm">Zechariah 8:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>); so Latin, <span class="accented">mulcere caput.</span> Hence it means, "to entreat the favour of God" for their city.

This fast in the fifth month, the month of Ab, had been established in memory of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.

But the Jews added others in memory of certain national events (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, etc.). In <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> mention is made of four extraordinary fasts instituted and observed during the Captivity, viz. on the ninth day of the fourth month, in memory of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; in the fifth month, in remembrance of the burning of the temple and city; in the seventh month, in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</a>); and in the tenth month, in memory of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (see note on ch. 8:19). <span class="cmt_word">Separating myself.</span> Abstaining from food and pleasure.
