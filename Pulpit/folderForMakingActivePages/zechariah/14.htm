It is a time when he will specially manifest his glory and power, and be recognized as allowing the trial of his people for wise purposes. It is impossible to fix on any historical fulfilment of this prophecy. The details suit neither Maccabean nor Roman times; the attempt to define exactly the period and matter of its accomplishment has proved a failure, and has led to a mingling of events of very different dates, and to a conglomeration of senses literal, metaphorical, and anagogical, which creates confusion while assuming to explain difficulties. The literal interpretation must be resigned, and the whole prophecy must be taken to adumbrate the kingdom of God in its trial, development, and triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Thy spoil shall be divided.</span> Jerusalem is addressed; and the prophet intimates that the enemy shall get possession of the capital, plunder it, and divide its spoil among themselves in its very midst with the greatest security, the inhabitants being wholly at the conquerors' mercy.

Or it may apply to the city alone, while the other referred to the whole land. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be out off.</span> In the former captivity all the people were carried away; in this capture of the city a remnant shall be left therein. It is plain from this statement that the prophecy cannot apply to the destruction of the city by the Romans; for, according to the account of Josephus ('Bell.

The geographical detail is added in the text to indicate the line of escape which shall be opened for those who are to be de-livened. This is the only place in the Old Testament where the Mount of Olives is thus exactly named; but it is often alluded to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>;  <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a> (where it is called "the mount of corruption"), etc. Shall cleave in the midst thereof. As the enemy are supposed to beset Jerusalem, so as to make escape by any ordinary road impossible, the Lord will open a way through the very centre of the mountain (as he opened a path through the Red Sea), by cleaving the hill in sunder, the two parts moving north and south, and leaving a great valley running east and west, and leading to the Arabah.

If Azal, or Azel, be a proper name, it is with some probability identified with Beth-ezel, mentioned in <a href="../../par/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, a village on the east of Olivet. The meaning in this case is that the valley should extend from the west unto the east side of the Mount of Olives, and that in it the people shall find an asylum, that they might not be involved in the judgments which fall on the enemy. Some take <span class="accented">Azal</span> to mean "union," and see in it a symbol of the union of the Law and the gospel, or the Jew and Gentile, in one Church - the valley of God's mountain extending to "union;" that is, to enfolding all the faithful (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earthquake in the days of Uzziah.</span> This is mentioned in <a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, but not in the historical books (see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>).

But such abrupt changes of persons are not uncommon (see note on Zechariah 2:8). The "holy ones" are the angels (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; and the parallel predictions in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>).

With the absence of light and sun shall come bitter frost, which impedes all activity, and kills life: or, taking the Septuagint rendering, there shall no longer be the interchange of seasons, but one lasting sunshine. It is plain that a time of distress and calamity is intended, and that the passage is threatening and not consolatory, at any rate, at first. There is solid ground for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, adopted by Cheyne and others, which is according to the Khetib, "There shall not be light, the bright ones shall contract themselves;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heavenly bodies shall contract their light, or be heaped confusedly together, and cease to shine. The prediction in this case may be compared with that in <a href="../../par/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; and in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12, 13</a>.

It is not full daylight, for calamity presses; it is not deep night, because there is hope amid the distress. <span class="cmt_word">At evening time it shall be light.</span> In the midst of trouble and danger deliverance shall come.

Geba was a town and district on the edge of the great Wady Suweinit, five miles north of Jerusalem.

Rimmon is described as "south of Jerusalem," to distinguish it from a town of the same name in Galilee (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>), and from the famous rock Rimmon, to which the Benjamites fled (<a href="../../par/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>).

Thus Zechariah illustrates the growth and stability of the Church of God by the figure of the earthly city Jerusalem, firmly and orderly built, and inhabited by a teeming population, as the following verse shows.

The prophet here and in the following clause speaks as a Jew to Jews, who knew and observed only the prescribed form of worship. It is evident that the announcement could never be literally fulfilled; the Gentile world could never come yearly to pay their devotions at Jerusalem. The prediction can only signify that under Messiah's reign the Gentiles shall be converted to true religion and worship God in regular, orderly fashion, the prophet intimating this in terms derived from the old dispensation, which had the Divine sanction. <span class="cmt_word">The Feast of Tabernacles.</span> The Israelites were required to appear before the Lord three times in the year (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>) - at the festivals of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. But the Gentiles are here required to present themselves only once. The Feast of Tabernacles is chosen for this occasion owing to its peculiar character and the associations connected with it. It commemorated not only the ingathering of the harvest, but also Israel's sojourn in the wilderness and tide Divine protection there accorded to them, and their entrance into tide promised land; it was therefore a fitting symbol of the rescue of the Gentiles from the devil's kingdom, and their entry into the Church of God, where they enjoyed the blessings of God's grace and protection. It was also a more catholic feast, in one sense, titan the Passover or Pentecost, not being so distinctively Jewish, but one which all nations could keep in gratitude to the Giver of material benefits. We must remember, also, that it was at this feast that our Lord cried (<a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink," and likewise he declared himself to be "the Light of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), wishing us, it may be, to understand that this feast was the one we should need to keep, being the one which specially sets  him forth as the Sustainer and Guide through life's pilgrimage.

As the rise of the Nile depends upon the equinoctial rains in the interior, the failure of these would be disastrous.

"The bells," says Henderson, "were small metallic plates, suspended from the necks or heads of horses and camels, for the sake of ornament, and making a tinkling noise by striking against each other like cymbals." Probably these plates had the names of the owners engraven on them. The Septuagint gives "bridle," which possibly the unusual word <span class="accented">metzilloth</span> may mean. <span class="cmt_word">HOLINESS</span> (<span class="accented">holy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">UNTO THE LORD</span>; <span class="accented">Sanctum Domino</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint). This was the inscription upon the golden plate on the mitre of the high priest (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>).

If any vessel might now be used in God's service, worshippers would no longer be obliged to buy special bowls from those who sold in the temple courts (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>). But it is best in agreement with the context to take "Canaanite" to mean any unclean or profane person (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, etc.).
