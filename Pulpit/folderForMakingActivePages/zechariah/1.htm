This was called Bul before the Captivity (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), and afterwards Marchesvan (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:3 3); it answered to parts of October and November, and was a time of rain. Haggai had first prophesied two months earlier. <span class="cmt_word">The second year of Darius.</span> Being now under foreign rule, the prophet uses the regnal years of the king to whom his people were subject (see note on Haggai 1:1<span class="cmt_word">).

A comma should be inserted after "Iddo" here and in ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Saying.</span> The visions virtually spoke to him, communicated to him the Lord's will; but first he has to deliver the following warning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The prophet admonishes the people not to follow their forefathers</span> <span class="accented">evil example, but to turn to the Lord with all their heart.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath been sore displeased</span>; literally, <span class="accented">displeased with displeasure</span>, which the versions render, <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">iratus iracundia</span> (el. ver. 15). Not only events connected with their earlier history proved that God had been incensed with their forefathers, but the ruin of their kingdom, and the late Captivity, and the desolation around them, were evidence of the same sad truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say thou unto them</span>. The prophet shows why he has reminded them of their forefathers' sins and punishment. Saith the Lord of hosts. The expression recurs three times in this verse; it denotes the almightiness and infinite resources of God (see note A in the appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's edition of this prophet). Its constant repetition, as in Haggai, gives a certain heaviness to the prophet's style. <span class="cmt_word">Turn</span> (<span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">ye unto me</span>. He calls the people to repentance, partly, doubtless, with a view to their taking an active part in rebuilding the temple, thus carrying on the exhortations of Haggai, but also with reference to their general indevotion and laxity which Ezra afterwards had to reprove (see <a href="../../par/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord of hosts;</span> literally, (<span class="accented">it is</span>) <span class="accented">the utterance of Jehovah of hosts.</span> This is a more threatening form than the mere "saith" in the other two places in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn (</span><span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto you (</span><a href="../../par/malachi/3-7.htm">Malachi 3:7</a>). God promises his favour on their repentance and better conduct; as Haggai had been commissioned to proclaim a return of fruitful seasons as soon as the people obeyed his word and attended diligently to the work before them (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>). They were called now to attend to the pure worship of the Lord, as the sole condition of prosperity (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). It has been well observed that when it is said, "Turn ye unto me," etc., we are reminded of our free will; and when we cry, "Turn us, good Lord, and we shall be turned," we acknowledge the need of God's preventing grace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and <i>from</i> your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The former prophets have cried.</span> Omit "have."

Jerome referred these words to the false prophets, resting, doubtless, on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-19.htm">Jeremiah 37:19</a>. But it is more natural to refer them to the "former prophets" mentioned above and in the following verse.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which <i>is</i> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-17.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The first vision: the horsemen in the myrtle grove.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In a series of visions it is now shown what is the nature of the restored theocracy, and what shall befall it. Thus were the people comforted by bearing God's purposes of mercy and the great future that awaited Israel. In this first vision it is revealed to Zechariah that the Gentile nations should be overthrown, and that whatever might be the present condition of the Jewish people, God's purpose of mercy toward them was unshaken and would be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">The four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat.</span> This month (called here by its Chaldean name) answered to parts of January and February. It was three months since Zechariah had been called to the prophetical office, and five since the building of the temple had been resumed at Haggai's remonstrance. Meantime Haggai had concluded his mission by uttering his final prophecies two months ago, and now Zechariah carries on the revelation. A comparison of the months in the cuneiform inscriptions with the Hebrew will be found in Schrader, 'Keilinschriften,' 379, and in Dr. Wright's note on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord</span>. Thee visions with their explanations are in effect the oracle (see note on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that <i>were</i> in the bottom; and behind him <i>were there</i> red horses, speckled, and white.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw by night</span>; <span class="accented">in the night</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the night of the twenty-fourth day (ver. 7). The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. <span class="cmt_word">A man riding upon a red horse.</span> This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, "that stood among the myrtle trees," serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as "behind" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11. Thus there are in the scene only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the prophet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angel rider and his attendants; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the interpreting angel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The red colour of the horse is supposed to represent war and bloodshed, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>; but this seems unsuitable in this piece, where nothing of the kind is intimated, but rather the contrary (ver. 11). It is, indeed, impossible to affix any satisfactory explanation to the colour. If, as we may well suppose, this personage is the Angel of the covenant, who was the leader and guide of the Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>), his standing in the valley among the myrtles may represent the depressed and humbled condition of the chosen people, which yet was well pleasing unto God, like the sweet scent of odoriferous myrtles is agreeable to men. <span class="cmt_word">The myrtle trees.</span> The myrtle is indigenous in the hilly regions of Northern Palestine, and is still seen in the glens near Jerusalem, though no longer on the Mount of Olives, where the returned captives found it when celebrating their first Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the bottom;</span> <span class="accented">the valley.</span> Myrtles love such places. "Amantes littora myrtos" (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:124). The term would suit the valley of the Kidron. Others render, "the shady place," or "the tabernacle," but not so appropriately. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Alex., 860] <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "between the shady mountains." The Greek translators seem to have borrowed their reading from ch. 6, where the chariots issue from between two mountains of brass. <span class="cmt_word">Behind him were them red horses;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>  horses mounted by riders (ver. 11). Speckled. It is not clear what colour is meant by this word. The Revised Version gives <span class="accented">sorrel</span>; Wright, "bay or chestnut;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: "dapple-grey and spotted;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">varii.</span> The Septuagint Version is probably a double rendering. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils of the vitae. What is intended by the different colours of the horses is a matter of great dispute, and cannot be known. There is some reason for considering that they represent the world powers at this particular period - the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greek; three of those concerning which Daniel prophesied; the fourth, the Roman, not having yet come in view. The notion of tutelary angels, presiding over countries, was familiar to the Hebrew mind (see <a href="../../par/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12, 13, 20, 21</a>). These horsemen are evidently not post couriers, but warriors on military service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, O my lord, what <i>are</i> these?

Hence some regard the expression as intimating a communication berne inwardly to the soul without the aid of external organs, or that the angel overpowered and influenced the prophet as the evil spirit possessed the demoniac. But the same term is used, as Dr. Wright points out, in the sense of to commune with a person (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a>), and to speak to a person (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may, however, be that the angel of the Lord presented matters objectively, and the prophet's own angel interpreted subjectively. But the Authorized Version is probably correct. <span class="cmt_word">I will show thee.</span> This he does through the chief angel (ver. 10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These <i>are they</i> whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The man that stood,</span> etc. The rider upon the red horse of ver. 8, the leader of the company of horsemen.

There was no sign of that shaking of nations which Haggai (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7, 21, 22</a>) had foretold should precede the coming of Messiah and the restoration of Israel. In this second year of Darius, the empire, though suffering from internal disturbances, was outwardly at peace, and was threatened by no enemy at a distance. But the condition of the Jews was sad and disheartening; the temple still unbuilt, the walls of Jerusalem lying in ruins, themselves only a small remnant, exposed to the insults and attacks of jealous neighbours, living on sufferance as subjects of a heathen power, and no sign of the predicted salvation appearing, - this was their state. And the angel sees their despondency, recognizes their disappointment, and intercedes for them.

There are two computations of this period. The first dates from the first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar,  <span class="date">B.C. 606</span>, when Judaea was made tributary to Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>: <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-6.htm">2 Chronicles 36:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>, etc.), unto the return of the company of exiles under Zerubbabel,  <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>; the second dates from the final destruction of Jerusalem,  <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, unto the second year of Darius,  <span class="date">B.C. 519</span>, when Zechariah saw these visions. However reckoned, the dark period was now over; might they not now expect the commotion among the nations which was to precede their own restitution? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me <i>with</i> good words <i>and</i> comfortable words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord answered.</span> The Angel of Jehovah is thus ca]led as the representative of God, whether we regard him as the Logos or a created angel empowered by God (see note on ver. 11).

Good words, promising blessing and salvation  (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-7.htm">1 Kings 12:7</a>); and these are comfortable words (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-18.htm">Isaiah 57:18</a>), a message calculated to bring comfort to the people's desponding hearts.

The first proof of God's renewed mercy would be seen in the restoration of the temple, the symbol of the theocracy, and in the revival of the city, the type of national life. The "line" had been used for purposes of destruction (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-8.htm">Lamentations 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cry yet, saying.</span> This introduces the second part of the prophet's message. The LXX. begins the verse with the words, "And the angel that spake in me said unto me." <span class="cmt_word">My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad.</span> "Yet," in this verse, is better rendered <span class="accented">again.</span> God calls the cities his, to show his love for Judah; and he promises that they shall not only be reoccupied by returning immigrants, but increased in extent and number by reason of the enlarged population. So Josephus tells us that in later times Jerusalem had outgrown its walls, and that the fourth quarter, Bezetha, was added ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:04. 2). But it seems' best to translate the clause thus: "My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc affluent civitates meae bonis</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall yet comfort Zion,</span> for all her afflictions. <span class="cmt_word">Shall yet choose Jerusalem</span> (<a href="../../par/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a> [16, Hebrew]; 3:2). God will show that the election of Israel remains unimpaired and secure (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-5.htm">2 Chronicles 6:5</a>). The partial fulfilment of the items of this prophecy are to be found in the rebuilding of the temple, the restoration of Jerusalem by Nehemiah, and the prosperity of Judah under the Asmonean princes. A hint of further blessings is given in the final clause, but their nature is not expressly mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">The second vision. the four horns and the four craftsmen.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I lifted up mine eyes, and saw.</span> This vision is closely connected with the former. The prophet had been told that the hostile nations should be punished and scattered; he now is shown this threat being executed. <span class="cmt_word">Four horns,</span> belching to four beasts but dimly seen or wholly invisible. Horns are symbols of strength and power (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). Here they mean powers hostile to Israel, and the number "four" (the symbol of completeness) points to the four winds from which they come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from every side. In the Hebrew ch. 2. begins at this verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>be</i> these? And he answered me, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which have scattered,</span> etc. Some see here an allusion to the prophecy of Daniel concerning the Babylonians, Medo-Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. Against this view it is urged that the prophet is speaking of past events, not of a far distant future. Others Lake the four horns to represent Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, and Medo-Persia, all of which had scattered Israel. But it is well to lay no special stress on such explanations of symbolical language, which are at best mere conjectures, liable to be overthrown by a new theory. The word "scattered," which Jerome renders <span class="accented">ventilaverunt</span>, means properly, as Wright observes, "to winnow," to separate and scatter by means of the wind. The perfect tense of this verb must not be pressed so as to exclude all notion of coming events. The prophets see at one glance past and future, and combine in one expression far distant occurrences. Doubtless Zechariah's vision has some relation to  Daniel's, and his description of the powers hostile to the Church of God runs on parallel lines with that of his predecessor. Whether be refers to the same four empires must be left in uncertainty. <span class="cmt_word">Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem</span>. All the tribes and the capital. According to Ewald, Judah is named first as occupying the place of honour, even as Benjamin is named before Judah in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>, because the capital city lay in its territory. Jerusalem was the centre of worship and government for all the people, the northern tribes being represented by Israel. the southern by Judah. Some critics cancel the word "Israel" here, and there is no doubt that it is often written for "Jerusalem" by mistake (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> [where see Professor Cheyne's note]; 32:30, 32; 51:49; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>). Gratz supposes that in the present passage the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word "Jerusalem" after the wrong one "Israel," but leaving the latter still in the manuscript. Of course, there is no proof of this supposition. Some manuscripts of the Septuagint omit "Jerusalem" here.

The word is applied to workers in wood, stone, and metal; therefore an ambiguous rendering seems most suitable here. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">fabros.</span> They represent the human agencies employed by God to overthrow the powers hostile to the Church. Their number is the same as that of the "horns," thus showing their adequacy for the work which they have to execute. It is quite unnecessary to attempt to identify the four "craftsmen." Some take them to be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah; or Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Alexander the Great; or the four evangelists; or generally, angels. We shall be safer if we look upon them merely as God's instruments and servants without further identification.
