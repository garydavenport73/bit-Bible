Thus, much of Judaea, during the absence of the exiles, became a "<span class="accented">wilderness"</span> and a "<span class="accented">desert"</span> (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like</span> <span class="cmt_word">Eden...  like the garden of the Lord.</span> The Prophet Joel compares Judaea before its desolation to "<span class="accented">the</span> garden of Eden" (<a href="../../par/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>): and Ezekiel, like Isaiah, prophesies that it shall once more become "like the garden of Eden," when the exiles have returned to it (Ezekiel 37:35). With the last-named writer, Eden represents all that is glorious, not in nature only, but in art (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8, 9, 16, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The voice of melody</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, and <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 11).

Some manuscripts have "O ye nations." But the reading is undoubtedly a wrong one. <span class="cmt_word">A law shall proceed from me</span>.

"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and. a thousand years as one day" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). Isaiah always speaks as if the Messianic kingdom was to supervene almost immediately on the return of the exiles to Palestine. It was not revealed to him that there would be an interval of from five hundred to six hundred years between the two events. By God's "<span class="accented">righteousness"</span> here we must understand his righteous plans for the redemption of his people through Christ, and for the punishment of those who resist his will and remain impenitent. The <span class="accented">salvation</span> and the <span class="accented">judgment</span> are the two parts of the "<span class="accented">right</span>eousness." <span class="cmt_word">The isles shall wait upon me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4, 10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>, etc.; and the comment on Isaiah 42:4). On mine arm shall they trust. God's "arm" is his executive power - that might by which he effects his purposes. The "isles" or "countries" that have been expecting the coming of a Deliverer will have faith in his power to redeem and save them. Christianity was received with more readiness by the Gentiles than by the "peculiar people" (<a href="../../par/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-42.htm">Acts 13:42, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>, etc.).

Look to that which seems to you most stable and most certain to endure - the vast firmament of the heavens, and the solid earth beneath it, of which God "bears up the pillars" (Psalm l25:3). Both these, and   man too, are in their nature perishable, and will (or may) vanish away and cease to be. But God, and his power to save, and his eternal law of right, can never pass away, but must endure for evermore. Let Israel be sure that the righteous purposes of God with respect to their own deliverance from Babylon, and to the conversion of the Gentiles, stand firm, and that they will most certainly be accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens shall vanish</span> <span class="cmt_word">away like smoke</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the earth shall wax</span> <span class="cmt_word">old like a garment.</span> So also in <a href="../../par/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>. The new heaven and new earth promised by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17; 66:22</a>), St. Peter (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>), and St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>) are created in the last times, because "the first heaven and the first earth have passed away." They that dwell therein shall die in like manner. Dr. Kay observes that the Hebrew text does not say, "in like manner," but "as in like manner." Man is not subject to the same law of perishableness as the external world, but to a different law. External things simply "pass away" and are no more. Man disappears from the earth, but continues to exist somewhere. He has, by God's gift, a life that is to be unceasing.

There has been much doubt as to the utterer of this "splendid apostrophe." Zion, the prophet, the angels, Jehovah, and God the Son pleading with God the Father, have been suggested. To us it seems simplest and best to assign the passage to the prophet. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>). When God neglects the prayers and supplications of his people, he is spoken of as "asleep," and needing to be awoke by a loud cry. The anthropomorphism is obvious, and <span class="accented">of course</span> not to be taken literally (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Put on strength</span>.

"<span class="accented">Rahab"</span> is literally "<span class="accented">pride</span>," or "the proud one." The event alluded to, both here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, is the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea (see ver. 10<span class="cmt_word">).

"The dragon" is another symbol of the Egyptian power (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, "Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers"). Originally designating God's great enemy, Satan (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>), it is a term which comes to be applied to the adversaries of the Almighty generally.

Ver. 12. - I am he that comforteth you (comp. ver. 3, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>). Who art thou?

It is, however, quite possible to regard Israel as still addressed; since Israel too was the recipient of God's words (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>), and was protected by God's hand from destruction, and kept in existence until the happy time should come when God would create a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) for Israel's dwelling-place<span class="cmt_word">, and say unto Zion</span> - <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the "new Jerusalem" <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my people</span>. This crowning promise well terminates the comforting address wherewith Jehovah at this time saw fit to cheer and encourage his captive people.

The comfort afforded to Israel generally is now concentrated on Jerusalem. Her condition during the long period of the Captivity is deplored, and her want of a champion to assert her cause and raise her out of the dust is lamented (vers. 17-20). After this, an assurance is given her that the miseries which she has suffered shall pass from her to her great enemy, by whom the dregs of the "cup of trembling" shall be drained, and the last drop wrung out (vers. 21-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. ver. 9 and <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>). Isaiah marks the breaks in his prophecy, sometimes by a repetition of terminal clauses, which have the effect of a refrain (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; and Isaiah 48:22; 57:21); sometimes by a repetition of initial clauses of a striking character (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 11, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1, 12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4, 7, 9</a>, etc.).

Which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury.</span> The cup of God's fury was poured out on Jerusalem when the city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, the temple, the royal palace, and the houses of the nobles burnt (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), the walls broken down (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>), and the bulk of the inhabitants carried away captive to Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-25.htm">2 Chronicles 34:25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-31.htm">Ezekiel 22:31</a>, etc.). "The cup of God's fury" is an expression used by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). The dregs of the cup; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the goblet-cup</span> (Cheyne), or <span class="accented">the out-swollen cup.</span> It is the fulness of the measure of Jerusalem's punishment, not its character, which is pointed at.

The city, no doubt, suffered by this state of things, becoming more ruined and more desolate than it would have been otherwise. Had Johanan and the Jews under him remained in the land, God had promised to "build them, and not pull them down;" to "plant them, and not pluck them up" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a>). Thus Jerusalem's extreme desolation was not wholly the result of the Babylonian  conquest, but was partly due to the after-misconduct of the Jews left in the country.

What are the "two things," it is asked, since four are mentioned - <span class="cmt_word">desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword?</span> The right answer seems to be that of Aben Ezra and Kimchi, that the two things are "desolation," or rather "wasting" within, produced by "famine;" and "destruction" without, produced by "the sword." <span class="cmt_word">Who shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">sorry for thee?</span> rather, <span class="accented">who will mourn with thee?</span> Jerusalem is without friends; no man condoles with her over her misfortunes.

As his people have a relentless adversary, who accuses them continually, and pleads against them (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>), so it is needful that they should have an untiring advocate.
