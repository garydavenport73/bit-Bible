(On the cockatrice, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>.) The meaning here is that the people gave themselves to brooding on and hatching purposes which were as pernicious and destructive as the eggs of venomous serpents.

They cannot construct, their devices fall through, their "spinning" is to no purpose; but they can, in a rough and blind way, do enormous mischief. "Their feet run to evil" - rush to it at full speed - brook no delay, but hurry on into act. It is an easy thing to shed innocent blood; and those who are conscious of constructive impotence are very apt to seek compensation by doing destructive work, which at least shows that they have a power of some kind. Hence "Reigns of Terror" when revolutions are at the last gasp. The strong expressions with respect to shedding innocent blood, used here and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a> and 2 Kings 24:4, seem to imply something like a massacre of the more godly Israelites by the ungodly in Manasseh's time. <span class="cmt_word">Wasting and destruction</span> (compare the "destruction and misery" of <a href="../../par/romans/3-16.htm">Romans 3:16</a>, which is a quotation of the present passage).

Once let there be no regard for truth in a state, no discredit attaching to lying, and all virtue is undermined, all soundness is vanished - nothing remains but "wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a><span class="cmt_word">). He that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey</span>. Evil-doers prosper.

The deliverance will be followed by the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which will continue for ever. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord saw it</span>. The division of the verses here requires alteration. The opening clause of ver. 15 belongs to what precedes; the second clause to what follows. "The Lord saw" that condition of things in Israel which is described in vers. 3-15; and it displeased him; literally, <span class="accented">it was evil in his eyes</span>, especially in that there was no judgment. Justice was not done between man and man; no one thought of pronouncing just judgments. The circumstances were such as to invite a Divine interposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he saw that <i>there was</i> no man, and wondered that <i>there was</i> no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God looked for some champion of the oppressed to arise; it was to be expected under the circumstances. But, alas! "there was no man." None stood up to resist the unrighteous and protect the innocent; much less did any stand up to deliver Israel from its heathen adversaries. When it is said that God "<span class="accented">wondered"</span> at no champion appearing, we must understand the expression as an anthropomorphism&middot; <span class="cmt_word">Therefore his arm brought salvation unto him</span>. As them was no human champion, it became necessary that God should arise in his own Person, and show himself. "His arm" and "his righteousness" were enough; no human aid was needed, or could have added anything to the resistless strength of his might (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>).

The Isaiah anthropomorphism is far less gross than the Homeric. The gods in Homer put on actual armour, and take sword and shield. Jehovah arms himself for the battle in a way that is manifestly metaphoric. He puts on a "Divine panoply"  - righteousness as his breastplate, salvation as his helmet, vengeance for garments, and zeal, or jealousy, for a cloak. He takes no offensive weapons - "the out-breathing of his Spirit (ver. 19) is enough" (Kay).

God's "adversaries" are those of his own household - his people, the ungodly Israelites; his "enemies" are the heathen that oppress his people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, which is very similar). <span class="cmt_word">To the islands</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the maritime lands, which, under Assyria, and afterwards under Babylon, took part in the oppression of his people.

As usual, the prophet does not note, or perhaps see, intervals of time, but blends events of various periods into one glorious vision of triumphant deliverance, redemption, and prolonged spiritual life in the Redeemer's kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a></div><div class="verse">As for me, this <i>is</i> my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that <i>is</i> upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and I.</span> The prophet begins with one construction, and then checks himself, and introduces another. <span class="cmt_word">This is my covenant</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; and see the comment on Isaiah 53:3). The new covenant involved the giving of God's Spirit to his people (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>); and this Spirit, it is here promised, shall not depart from God's people while time endures. The Spirit will be accompanied with certain "words" which will be put into the Church's mouth; and these words will remain unchanged and pass on from mouth to mouth, age after age, for ever. The "words" intended are probably those of the entire Bible - "all God's revelations" (Cheyne) - which the Church will maintain as inspired truth through all ages. <span class="cmt_word">Upon thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon Israel. The change of number and person ("with them...  upon thee") is not unusual in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11, 12</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/58.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 58"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 58" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/60.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 60"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 60" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
