But the precise date of the dedication is a matter of dispute and uncertainty. We know that it took place in the seventh month of the year, but of what year we cannot be so sure. Was it the same year in the <span class="accented">eighth</span> month of which (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>) the house was finished (Ewald)? Was the dedication, that is to say, one month anterior to the completion of the house and its appointments? Or are we to understand "the seventh month" to mean the Ethanim of the following year (Bahr)? are we to assign the dedication, that is, to a date eleven months after completion? Or, finally, are we to believe with the Vat. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> (the LXX. text is here, however, in great confusion), that the temple was not dedicated until the palaces were also built (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1-9</a>); are we to hold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that though finished and ready for use, it remained unused for a period of thirteen years (Thenius, Keil)? These are questions which we cannot perhaps answer with absolute certainty, but, to my mind, every consideration is in favour of the date first mentioned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the seventh month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign. It is true Bahr says that this opinion "needs no refutation," while Keil pronounces it directly at variance with  <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>." But it is worth while to inquire whether this is so? And, first, as to the bearing of the passage just cited, "So was ended all the work which," etc., taken in connexion with <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>, "Then Solomon assembled," etc. To the cursory reader it appears no doubt as it this "then" must refer to the completion of the work of which we have just heard, and which was not effected until the eighth month of the year (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> though probably a mark of time (  =  tune), is clearly a word of great latitude of meaning, and may apply as well to one month before completion (the time specified in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>) as to eleven months after; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it would be quite consistent with the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> of the sacred writers to describe the temple as finished, when in reality it was incomplete in a few minor particulars (<span class="accented">De minimis non curat scriptura</span>). Further more, if the temple was finished in every detail, and in all its furniture and appointments, in the eighth month, as we learn from <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, we may be perfectly sure it would or could be <span class="accented">practically</span> finished - finished so as to be ready for consecration - by the seventh month. Indeed, it is not an unreasonable presumption, that it hardly would be perfect and complete on the day of dedication. Those who have built or restored churches, not to speak of cathedrals, which would perhaps afford a closer analogy to the temple, know how extremely difficult, if not impossible, it is to have every detail finished and arranged for the day of consecration. Some few accidental omissions will have to be supplied afterwards, or experience will suggest certain alterations and improvements which have to be made. There is no inherent improbability, therefore, that the temple should be dedicated in the seventh month, though it was not finished <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> until the eighth month, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, three or four weeks later. And there was a strong reason why the dedication should take place at the earliest possible date. There had been a long period of preparation, extending back into the preceding reign (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28.htm">1 Chronicles 28, 29</a>.); the dedication consequently had long been eagerly looked for; moreover the erection had evidently been hurried forward, a prodigious number of labourers having been employed in order to expedite the work. It is almost inconceivable, therefore, that, after these energetic measures had been taken, either the king or the nation should have been content to wait thirteen years - nearly twice the time it had taken to build the temple - until the palaces, which were entirely independent and secular buildings, were also completed. If the great national sanctuary, which was the glory of the land, was ready for use, as we know it was, we  can hardly believe, considering the natural eagerness and impatience of men, that the tribes of Israel, or their ambitious monarch, would, of their own choice, defer the consecration for an indefinite number of years. It would appear consequently that it is the view that the dedication was postponed for thirteen years "hardly needs discussion" (see below on 1 Kings 9:1). And the same considerations apply, though perhaps with diminished force, to their waiting one year. For if it be said that the delay was occasioned by the desire to connect the dedication with the feast of tabernacles, which was <span class="accented">par excellence</span> the feast of the year (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;</span>) the answer is that it is more likely that the work would be hurried on by the employment of additional hands, if need be, or that the edifice would be consecrated, though not complete in all its details, at the feast of the eleventh year, than that, for the sake of one month, they should wait eleven months. And if the objection be raised that a feeling of religious awe would forbid the dedication of an imperfect building, or of a perfect building with imperfect arrangements, it is easy to reply that both building and furniture may have been practically complete, and may have been believed at the time to be perfect, but that the experience of the first few days suggested a few alterations or additions which threw the completion of the work in all its particulars into the eighth month. It is worthy of notice that Josephus distinctly states that the dedication was in the seventh month of the eighth year (Ant. 8:04. 1) ] <span class="cmt_word">Solomon assembled</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. See Ewald, 233 <span class="accented">b</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">princes</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the fathers of the children of Israel</span>. [This great assembly (compare <a href="../../par/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>) can hardly be said to have been suggested to Solomon by the precedent afforded by David (Keil), when bringing up the ark (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>), for it was only natural that he should summon the representatives of the people to witness an event of such profound importance in the national history, as the dedication, after years of waiting (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6-13</a>), of a national sanctuary intended to supersede the tabernacle, at which for five centuries their forefathers had worshipped. And the more so, as they had been called together by David to con-salt about the erection (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>), and had offered willingly of their treasures (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6-9</a>) towards its decoration. It is inconceivable, therefore, that the temple of the Jews could have been formally opened, except in the presence of the "elders and heads of the tribes." Nor can we (with Rawlinson) see a contrast between the more popular proceedings of David, who "gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, <span class="accented">thirty thousand</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>), and the statelier, more aristocratic system of his son, who merely summons the chief men;" for Solomon's "eiders," etc. (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-4.htm">1 Samuel 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26-31</a>), may well have equalled David's "chosen men" in number. It is quite likely that there was more formality and stateliness in this latter ease, but it was practically the same class of persons, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the leading men by birth, talents, or prowess, that were present on both occasions. In fact, it was the Jewish Church by representation] <span class="cmt_word">unto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to bring up</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the ark of the covenant of the Lord</span> [so called because it contained the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with the children of Israel (ver. 9).

The same word is used of the feast of passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>) and pentecost (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 16), but "the feast" here can only mean that of tabernacles. As the "feast of ingathering" (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), as commemorating the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>), and as peculiarly a social festival (<span class="accented">ib</span>. vers. 40-42; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> sqq.), it was the most joyous as well as the greatest (?Jos., Ant. 8:04. 1) gathering of the year. (Compare the Jewish saying of a later date: "He who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.") It was doubtless for this reason that tabernacles was selected for the dedication. A special feast of dedication, however, was held for seven days before the feast of tabernacles proper commenced (see on ver. 65). It did not displace that great feast, however (Stanley), but simply preceded it. It is worthy of notice that Jeroboam selected the same feast (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a>) for the inauguration of his new cultus.

But there is no contradiction, as has been too readily supposed. For ver. 7 of the Chronicles," <span class="accented">the priests</span> brought in the ark," etc., confirms the statement of the text. And the explanation is suggested in ver. 5 of the same chapter, "These did the priests, the Levites (so the Heb.) bring up." Same expression in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>. All the priests were Levites - Keil translates, "the Levitical priests" - and this somewhat singular expression is no doubt used to remind us that such was the case. Nor need it cause us any surprise to find the priests employed in this service. It is true that the ark was given into the charge of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30, 31</a>); and it was their duty to bear it (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 11, 12</a>). But the real care and supervision of the ark always belonged to the sons of Aaron. It was their office, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to put on or take off the covering of the ark and of the vessels, which the Levites were forbidden directly to touch (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>). It was quite in accordance with the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of these provisions that Solomon now entrusted the carriage of the ark to the superior order. But more than that, Solomon was not without precedent to justify his choice, indeed, we may see in his selection of the priests a minute mark of truth, amounting almost to an undo-signed coincidence. For we find that on occasions of extraordinary solemnity - at the crossing of the Jordan, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6, 15, 17</a>), and at the siege of Jericho (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>), the <span class="accented">priests</span> had borne the ark (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11, 12</a>). It was no doubt these familiar precedents guided Solomon, or the ecclesiastical authorities, in their selection of the priests on this occasion. A "settled place," a "house of cedars" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>), "having now been found for the ark" to abide in, after it had "dwelt in curtains" for 500 years, it was taking its last journey, and in order to mark this journey as exceptional, in order to show both the ark and the house the greater reverence, it was determined that it should be borne for the last time by the priests. Keil suggests that the ark may have been uncovered, but this is very improbable. Why, we may ask, were coverings provided, and their use prescribed (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>), if they were to be arbitrarily dispensed with? He also adds that Levites were not allowed to enter the most holy place. But neither, it may be added, was this lawful for the priests. Levites and priests might enter that day, because the house was not then dedicated. The cloud (ver. 10) claimed it for God.

There may have been also in the background the idea of averting the Divine anger, of making a propitiation for possible errors and imperfections in their service. There were tragedies connected with the removal of the ark in time past (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>;  <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>) which, we may be sure, were not altogether forgotten on this occasion] <span class="cmt_word">that could not be told or numbered for multitude.</span> [Cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-13.htm">2 Samuel 6:13</a>.

Their length is mentioned in order to account for the ends being seen. It is immaterial to the meaning of the passage, however, which interpretation we put upon this verb. If we adhere to the A.V. then we must understand that, as it was forbidden to remove the staves from the rings at the corners of the ark (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12-15</a>), they drew the staves forward towards one end of the ark; that they removed the staves altogether from the ark (Stanley) is a view to which the text lends no support] <span class="cmt_word">the staves, that the ends</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heads</span>.

Several questions of considerable nicety suggest themselves here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> What was the position of the ark? Did it stand, that is to say, east and west, or north and south under the wings of the cherubim? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What was the position of the staves?

As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> the balance of evidence is in favour of the ark having stood north and south, in a line, that is, with the wings of the cherubim. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> only thus apparently could the cherubim have "covered the ark <span class="accented">and the staves thereof</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> If it had been otherwise, the "cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat," presuming that they were retained in the temple, would have had an unequal and one-sided position, for instead of being equally prominent, they would have stood, one with the back, the other with the face to the entrance and the holy place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had the ark stood east and west the projecting staves would surely have been in the high priest's way in the performance of his solemn functions (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-15</a>). That they served to guide him to the mercy seat is of course mere conjecture, and as such of no weight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> As to the staves, Josephus states (Ant. 3:07. 5) that they ran along the <span class="accented">sides</span> of the ark, and this would appear to be the natural and proper arrangement. It follows hence again that they cannot have been more than eight or nine cubits long, inasmuch as they found a place between the bodies of the cherubim, which cannot have been more than nine cubits apart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The explanation of the Rabbins is that the ends of the staves were not really <span class="accented">seen</span>, but that they projected into the curtain and so made two visible protrusions or prominences. But this view hardly satisfies the requirements of the text, and it assumes that the ark stood east and west, which we have found good reason to doubt. But even if this were so, it is doubtful  whether the staves, so long as they remained in the rings, could be made to reach to the door of the oracle, unless indeed they were lengthened for the purpose. How then were they seen? The following considerations may assist us to answer this question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The oracle, of course, in its normal state was in perfect darkness (ver. 12). Once a year, however, a gleam of light was admitted, when the curtain was drawn partially aside to permit of the high priest's entrance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When the curtain was drawn to one (probably the left) side, the light would fall, not on the ark, but on the ends of the staves projecting from the right or north end of the ark, which would thus be distinctly visible to the high priest. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> at this time the high priest was not alone in the holy place. It was not required that "there should be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation," except when the high priest went in to make an atonement for the <span class="accented">holy place</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>). At an earlier stage of the service he would seem to have required assistance. According to the Mishna (Yoma), a priest held the basin of blood and stirred it to prevent coagulation, at the time of his first entry. Moreover <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> his extremely doubtful whether the high priest can have drawn aside the curtain himself. Whether he entered three or four times on that day, at his first entry his hands were certainly full. If he carried "a censer full of burning coals of fire".. "and his hands (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">both</span> fits) full of sweet incense beaten small" (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 12), it is clear that some other person must have drawn aside the veil for him. It is to this person, I take it, the priest who was privileged to draw aside the curtain, and possibly to others standing near - certainly to the high priest - that the ends of the staves were visible. Nor would a reverent look directed towards these objects - made originally for the Levites to handle - involve unhallowed curiosity. And if this were so, it would help to explain (4) the mention of this circumstance by our author. If it were a fact that year by year a gleam of light fell upon the staves, and if priest after priest testified of what he had seen, up to the time of writing ("unto this day;" see below), we can readily understand why a circumstance of so much interest should be recorded. And we have not an adequate explanation of its mention here, if we are to understand that the staves were seen on the day of dedication, when of course they must have been visible, and never afterwards, or that the staves were partially drawn out of their rings in order to show that the ark was now at rest], <span class="cmt_word">and there they are unto this day.</span> [Same expression <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-19.htm">1 Kings 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>. At the date of the publication of this book, the temple was of course destroyed (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), so that at <span class="accented">that</span> day the staves were not there. But the explanation is very simple. Our historian has copied the words he found in the MS. he was using.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There was</i> nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there</span> [<a href="../../par/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>. This statement appears to be at variance with <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, which mentions "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded," as in the ark, along with "the tables of the covenant." And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (<span class="accented">temp</span>. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In <a href="../../par/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up "before the testimony," words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, "before the tables of testimony in the ark" - observe, the words are "before the <span class="accented">testimony</span>," not "before the <span class="accented">ark"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> but which are now generally thought to import "in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony." We know the book of the law was put "at the side (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) of the ark" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, "there was nothing," etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited "before the testimony" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>.);  and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that "there was nothing," etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] <span class="cmt_word">at Horeb</span> [See <a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-6.htm">Exodus 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>.

It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render "the cloud" or "the glory" by "the Shechinah." In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241).

Possibly the priests were about to burn incense. Evidently ministrations of some sort were intended and were interrupted. The exact correspondence with <a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>) is not to be overlooked.

It is certainly noticeable that what ver. 10 says of the cloud - that it "filled the house" - ver. 11 says of the glory. It is also true that there is no mention of any light or fire. And the "darkness" of ver. 12 might naturally seem to refer to the cloud, and therefore to exclude the idea of light. But surely the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;</span> are to be interpreted here by their signification and use elsewhere, and we find "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> elsewhere mentioned as something distinct from the cloud. We must remember that what by day was a pillar of cloud, by night was a pillar <span class="accented">of fire</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>). In <a href="../../par/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9, 16</a>, the mention of the "thick cloud" is followed by the statement that "Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it <span class="accented">in fire"</span> (ver. 18). Similarly, in <a href="../../par/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>, we are told that "the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (the glory?) six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like <span class="accented">devouring fire</span> " (vers. 16, 17). But perhaps the most decisive passage in this connexion is <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, where we are <span class="accented">told</span> that "the cloud abode <span class="accented">upon"</span> the tent of meeting, while "the glory of the Lord filled the (interior of the) tabernacle."

But the same word is used in ver. 66, of the people blessing the king. "Did the <span class="accented">people</span>," as Wordsworth pertinently asks, "also perform a priestly act?"

The later criticism objects to its authenticity that the many references to the Pentateuch (compare ver. 12 with <a href="../../par/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; ver. 31 with <a href="../../par/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>, <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; ver. 33 with <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; ver. 36 with <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>; ver. 50 with <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40, 42</a>; ver. 51 with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, etc.) prove it to be of a later date.

It is obviously open to reply that these references only prove that the king was acquainted, as he was bound to be (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>), with the words of the law. It divides itself into three parts. The first (vers. 22-30) is general; the second (vers. 31-53) consists of seven special petitions; the last (vers. 50-53) consists of a general conclusion and appeal to God's covenant mercy.

With the next verse the special or particular supplications begin. Like those of the Lord's prayer, they are seven in number, and no doubt for the same reason, viz., because seven was the number of covenant, the number which expressed the relationship between the Lord and His people ("<span class="accented">die Signatur der Verbindung Gottes und der Welt"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> Bahr, Symbolik, 1:187 sqq.) In fact, to the Jew the number "seven" was something like the sign of the cross to a large portion of Catholic Christendom, for it spoke to him of God's covenant of mercy and peace. And the first of the seven concerns <span class="accented">oaths</span>. The king implores the covenant-keeping God to watch over the covenants of words made in the now consecrated sanctuary, and to protect their sanctity by punishing the false swearer. There were cases in which the Mosaic law provided that an oath should be administered to suspected persons (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1, 4</a>, etc.) And there were other cases in which men of their own accord, for "an end of all strife," would make oath. Now every oath, whatever its form (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>), is in reality an affirmation" by the God of truth" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>); it is an appeal to the knowledge and power and justice of the Most High (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>). A false oath, consequently, dishonoured the Divine name, and polluted the sanctuary dedicated to that name, and if it went unpunished, contradicted the principles and provisions of the dispensation Of temporal punishments, and so encouraged falsehood and impiety. God is here entreated, consequently, to take cognizance of the oaths sworn before His altar (ver. 31), and to be a swift witness against the false swearers (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>). It is, perhaps, because of the direct dishonour which perjury offers to the Divine name that, as Bahr suggests, this prayer stands first among the seven, thus corresponding to the "Hallowed be Thy name" in the Lord's prayer, and to the third among the ten commandments.

The Gentiles who should visit Jerusalem would assuredly, with their polytheistic ideas and their belief in local or tribal deities, invoke the aid and blessing of the mighty God of Jacob. This mention of aliens from the commonwealth of Israel in the prayer of dedication, especially when viewed in the light of the exclusiveness and bigotry which characterized the Jews of later days, is especially to be noticed. As Rawlinson (<span class="accented">in loco</span>) observes, "Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic law than its liberality with regard to strangers." He then quotes <a href="../../par/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14-16</a>; and adds: "It is quite in the spirit of these enactments that Solomon, having first prayed God on behalf of his fellow countrymen, should next go on to intercede for the strangers," etc. The intercourse of the Hebrews at this period with foreign nations, and the influence they exercised on the Jewish thought and manners (see Stanley, "Jewish Ch." 2. Leer. 26.), are also to be remembered. These new relations with the stranger would no doubt have widened Solomon's views.

It has hence been too readily inferred that this portion of the prayer, at least, if not the preceding petition also, has been interpolated by a post-captivity writer. But there is really no solid reason for doubting its genuineness. Not only is it the <span class="accented">seventh</span> petition (see on ver. 31), but the captivity of Israel had been denounced as the punishment of persistent disobedience long before by Moses, and in the chapters to which such constant reference is made (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 64</a>; cf. 4:27) - a fact which is in itself an indirect proof of genuineness, as showing that this petition is of a piece with the rest of the prayer. And when to this we add that the carrying of a conquered and refractory race into captivity was an established custom of the East, we shall be inclined to agree with Bahr, that "it would have been more remarkable if Solomon had not mentioned it."

The latter passage, it should be noticed, treats of the captivity, so that Solomon, consciously or unconsciously, employs some of the very words used by Moses in contemplating this contingency.

But surely it is, to say the least, just as likely that the Jews, when the captivity of which Solomon spoke befel them, borrowed the phrase in which their great king by anticipation expressed their penitence. Seeing in the captivity a fulfilment of his prediction, they would naturally see  in this formula, which no doubt had been preserved in the writings of the prophets, a confession specially appropriate to their case, and indeed provided for their use.

He maintains, indeed, that the chronicler contradicts himself, for we can hardly think that the glory which we are told (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>) had already filled the house, left it and then returned.

The ceremonial of dedication was followed, as would naturally be the case, by sacrifices on a scale of unusual grandeur.

In the peace offering, the fat was burnt on the altar, but the flesh was eaten (ver. 15; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), so that this form of offering was, in every way, adapted to a festival.

For, in the first place, the Chronicles and all the Versions agree with the text, and, secondly, the numbers, compared with what we know of the sacrifices offered on other occasions, are not unduly large, nor were they such that (as has been alleged) it would be impossible to offer them within the time specified. If, at an ordinary Passover a quarter of a million of lambs could be sacrificed within the space of two or three hours (Jos., Bell. Jud. 6:09.8), there can obviously have been "no difficulty in sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep on each of the seven days of the festival" (Keil). (But were not the sacrifices spread over fourteen days? ver. 65.) And it is to be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "profusion was a usual feature of the sacrifices of antiquity Sacrifices of a thousand oxen (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) were not infrequent. According to an Arabian historian (Koto beddyn), the Caliph Moktader sacrificed during his pilgrimage to Mecca...  40,000 camels and cows and 50,000 sheep. Tavernier speaks of 100,000 victims as offered by the King of Tonquin" (Rawlinson, Stanley); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the context insists on the ex traordinary number of victims. They were so numerous, we are told, that the brazen altar was quite inadequate to receive them (ver. 64). It has been already pointed out (note on ver. 62) that the people joined the king in the sacrifices. Indeed it is against not only ver. 62, but vers. 63, 65, to suppose that all the victims were offered by Solomon alone (Ewald, Stanley). If these numbers, therefore, include those offered by the people, we can the more readily understand them. For, by the lowest computation, there could hardly be less than 100,000 heads of houses present at the feast (Bahr, Keil), and if the numbers of David's census (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) may be trusted, there may very well have been four or five times that number, and on such an occasion as that, an occasion altogether without precedent, every Israelite would doubtless offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving - the more so as a large number of victims would be required for the purposes of the subsequent feast. And as to the impossibility of the priests offering so prodigious a number within the specified time (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.), we have only to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that if there were 38,000 Levites (men over thirty years of age) in the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>), or any thing like that number, there <span class="accented">must</span> have been at the very least at this period two or three thousand priests (Keil), and we can hardly think that at the dedication of so glorious a temple, in which they were so profoundly interested, many of them would be absent from Jerusalem. But if there were only <span class="accented">one</span> thousand present, that number would have been amply sufficient to perform all the priestly functions. For it was no necessary, part of the priests' office either to slay the victim, or to prepare it for sacrifice - <span class="accented">that</span> any Israelite might do (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>, etc.); the duty of the priest was strictly limited to "sprinkling the blood round about upon the altar" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>; cf. 1:5), and burning the fat, the kidneys, etc., upon the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>). It is clear, consequently, that there is no difficulty whatsoever as to the manual acts required of the priests. It only remains to notice one other objection, viz., that the people could not possibly have eaten all the flesh of these peace offerings. But here again the answer is conclusive, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it was not necessary that all should be eaten, for the law expressly provided that if any of the flesh remained over until the third day, it should be burnt with fire (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-6.htm">Leviticus 19:6</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> no one can say what the number of people may not have been (see below on ver. 65), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the sacrifices were spread over fourteen days.] <span class="cmt_word">So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.</span>
