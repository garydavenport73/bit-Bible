Throughout this chapter Gideon is spoken of by the name of Jerubbaal. There must be some cause for this. The simplest and most probable cause is that this whole history of Abimelech is taken from some other source than the preceding chapters. And a considerable difference in the style of the narrative, which is feebler and more obscure, seems to bear out this inference. <span class="cmt_word">Went to Shechem</span>. This revolt from the house of Gideon in favour of Abimelech seems to partake of the nature of an Ephraimite rising against the supremacy of Manasseh. It was doubtless galling to the pride of the great tribe of Ephraim (<a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1-6</a>) that Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites should be the seat of government, and Gideon's ephod the centre of religion for the tribes of Israel. And so they seem to have taken advantage of Gideon's death, and of Abimelech's connection with Shechem, to make a league with the Hivite inhabitants of Shechem (see vers. 27, 28) to set up Abimelech as king, and to restore the worship of Baal, under the title of Baal-berith (<a href="../../par/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4, 27, 46</a>), at Shechem for all Israel to resort to.

The custom of collecting treasures at the temple, both that of the true God and of idols, whether they were offerings and gifts for the service of the temple, or treasures deposited there for safety, was very general (see <a href="../../par/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-8.htm">1 Chronicles 29:8</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>, etc.). The treasures belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphi were very great, and excited the cupidity of Xerxes, who sent an army to plunder the temple, but was foiled in the attempt. The Phocians are related to have seized 10,000 talents from the treasury of Delphi, nearly two and a half millions sterling. The temple of Diana at Ephesus had considerable treasures in money, as well as other valuable articles. Many other notices of the riches of temple treasures occur in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Vain and light persons</span>.

Timour, on his conquest of Persia, is said to have destroyed the whole male family of the king. At the conquest of Bagdad he is said <span class="accented">to</span> have made a pyramid of 90,000 human heads. In Persia and Turkey in modern times it has been a common practice for the sovereign to slay or put out the eyes of all his brothers and cousins. So destructive of natural affection is polygamy, and so cruel is power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that <i>was</i> in Shechem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of Millo</span>. Millo must have been some strongly fortified post in the neighbourhood of Shechem, and no doubt the place where the tower was, mentioned in vers. 46, 47. At Jerusalem we read of <span class="accented">Millo</span> as a part of the city of David in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>, apparently so called by the Jebusites, and the strengthening of it was one of Solomon's great works (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 24</a>). It is called <span class="accented">the house of Millo</span> in <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, where it is mentioned as the scene of the murder of King Joash. Here, therefore, <span class="accented">the house of Millo</span> probably means the citadel or keep of Sechem, a fortress analogous to the Bala-hissar in relation to Cabul, though possibly at a distance of a mile or two (ver 46, note). The phrase, <span class="accented">all the house of Millo</span>, means all the men who dwelt in the house of Millo, probably all men of war. <span class="cmt_word">Made Abimelech king</span>. We seem to see the hand of the Canaanite population in this term king, which was proper to the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11, 12</a>.), but was not yet domesticated in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The plain of the pillar</span>. This translation is clearly wrong. The word translated <span class="accented">plain</span> means an oak or <span class="accented">terebinth tree.</span> The word translated <span class="accented">pillar</span> is thought to mean a <span class="accented">garrison</span>, or <span class="accented">military post</span>, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a> (A.V. <span class="accented">mound</span>); but, according to its etymology and the meaning of other forms of the same root, may equally well mean a monument, or stone set up and this is probably the meaning here. The translation will then be <span class="accented">the oak of the monument</span>, a sense supported by the modern names of the mosque there, of which one is "the Oak of Moreh," and another "the Saint of the Pillar" (see Stanley's 'Sermons in. the East,' p. 182). And we are very strongly led to this conclusion by the further fact that there was a famous oak at Shechem, mentioned <a href="../../par/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> as the place where Jacob hid the idols of his household; and that Joshua took a great stone and "set it up under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord" at Shechem (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25, 26</a>). It marks a sad declension in the condition of Israel at this time, as compared with the days of Joshua, that the Shechemite Abimelech should be made king with a view to the restoration of Baal-worship on the very spot where theft fathers had made a solemn covenant to serve the Lord. It is remarkable that the narrative in this chapter gives us no clue as to the relations of the rest of Israel with Abimelech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 9:7-21 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when they told <i>it</i> to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the top of Mount Gerizim</span>. Mount Gerizim rises on the south-west side of Samaria or Shechem as a sheer rock about 800 feet in height, facing Mount Ebal, which is separated from it by the narrow valley, "some 500 yards wide," in which Samaria, now Nablus, is built. It was from Mount Gerizim that Joshua, in accordance with the directions given by Moses in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>, caused the blessings of the law to be proclaimed, after the capture of At, while the curses were proclaimed from Mount Ebal (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33, 35</a>). Some explain the name to mean "the mount of the Gerizzites," or Gerzites (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>); but the absence of the article makes this doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">Lifted up his voice</span>. Implying that a considerable effort was necessary to be heard by the people below. The narrowness of the valley, however, and the rocky nature of the cliffs there largely increase the sound. I have myself heard the human voice utter an articulate word at a measured distance of one mile one furlong and seventeen yards; but it was in a peculiar state of the atmosphere The experiment has been made in recent years, and it has been proved that a man's voice can be distinctly heard in Nablus, and also upon Ebal, from Gerizimo It is thought that Jotham, having emerged from one of the vast caverns, overhung with luxuriant creepers, which are in the mountain's side, "stood upon a huge projecting crag of Gerizim" just above the ancient site of Sheehem, and thence addressed the people who were assembled beneath him. The rich vegetation of that well-watered spot, "unparalleled in Palestine," supplied the materials of his fable; for the olive, the fig, the vine all grow in that rich valley; while the bramble, which creeps up the barren side of the mountain, and which is still used to kindle the fire to roast the lamb at the Samaritan Passover, was to be seen there in abundance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">The trees went forth <i>on a time</i> to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The trees</span>, etc. This is the earliest example of a <span class="accented">fable</span> in Scripture; indeed the only one except that in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>. It is remarked that in the Indian and Greek fables the animals are the <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span>, the fox, the lion, the ass, etc.; whereas in the only two specimens of Hebrew fable remaining to us, the members of the vegetable kingdom, the olive, the fig, the vine, the bramble, the cedar, the thistle, are the actors and speakers. The <span class="accented">parable</span>, of which <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> is a beautiful example, is quite different in its structure. Like the inimitable parables of our Saviour in the New Testament, it sets forth Divine troth under an image, but the image and all its parts are in strict accordance with nature. In the Scripture <span class="accented">allegory</span> real persons and their actions prefigure the actions and the persons which they are intended to represent (see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21-31</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). Allegorical personages may, however, be fictitious, as in the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The general meaning of this fable is clear. The trees worthy to reign for their intrinsic excellence refused the proffered kingdom one after another. The vilest and most unworthy accepted it. The result would be that a fire would burst out from the despicable bramble, and set fire to the lofty cedar tree. Thus Gideon refused the kingdom, and his sons had virtually refused it likewise. The base-born Abimelech had accepted it, and the result would be a deadly strife, which would destroy both the ungrateful subjects and the unworthy ruler.

The wine is said to cheer, or make to rejoice, God because the drink offering which accompanied the meat offering consisted of wine (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), and God was well pleased with the offerings of his people (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>). The idea in this verse, as in vers. 9 and 11, is, that while the olive, the fig, and the vine were occupied in <span class="accented">waving</span> their branches over the other trees, in token of their superiority, they would necessarily be neglecting., their own proper gift and office, which was to produce oil, and figs, and grapes.

The English would be less ambiguous if it ran, "If ye anoint me king over you in truth." The speech of the bramble indicates the grounds for suspicion already existing between Abimelech and the men of Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">Let fire come out</span>, etc. - keeping up the propriety of the image, as the natural function of the bramble was to kindle a fire, and as it had no other use; showing, too, how a base bramble could destroy a noble cedar, and the base-born Abimelech could bring ruin upon the lords of Shechem.

The simple reference to Gideon's great actions, and the juxtaposition of the base and bloody deed in which the Shechemites and the men of the house of Millo had made themselves accomplices by choosing Abimelech for their king, formed an indictment which could not be answered. With lofty scorn and irony he wishes well to them if they had acted honourably; but if not, he predicts the inevitable Nemesis of an alliance founded in bloodshed and treachery and wrong, viz., the mutual hatred and destruction of the contracting parties. Observe how "the house of Millo" is consistently spoken of as a separate community from "the men of Shechem."

Their disaffection first showed itself in acts of brigandage "against the peace of their lord the king," to use the language of our own mediaeval lawyers. The road to Shechem was no longer safe; lawless freebooters, in defiance of Abimelech's authority, stopped and robbed all travellers that passed that way, probably including Abimelech's own officers and servants. <span class="cmt_word">For him</span>. It may have been their intention even to lay violent hands upon Abimelech himself should he come to Shechem.

Who he was, or of what tribe or race he and his brethren were, we have no means of knowing; he seems to have been an adventurer who sought to turn the growing disaffection of the Shechemites to his own advantage by offering himself as a leader of the malcontents. Several MSS. and editions and versions read <span class="accented">Eber</span> for <span class="accented">Ebed.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-27.htm">Judges 9:27</a></div><div class="verse">And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode <i>the grapes</i>, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went out</span>, etc. The next step forward in the rebellion was taken at the time of the vintage, probably when they were inflamed with wine; for, after they had gathered in and trodden the grapes, they kept high festival in the temple of Baal-berith, on occasion of offering to their god the solemn thank offering for the vintage. And then, speaking freely under the influence of wine, they cursed Abimelech. The whole talk of the company was of his misdeeds, and seditious and rebellious words were freely uttered on all sides. <span class="cmt_word">Made merry</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">offered their thank offerings.</span> The same word is used in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-24.htm">Leviticus 19:24</a>: "In the fourth year all the fruit thereof (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the vineyard) shall be holy <span class="accented">to praise the Lord withal"</span> - literally, praise <span class="accented">offerings to the Lord.</span> These offerings were made by the Shechemites to Baal instead of to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a></div><div class="verse">And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who <i>is</i> Abimelech, and who <i>is</i> Shechem, that we should serve him? <i>is</i> not <i>he</i> the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gaal</span>, etc. Gaal now saw his opportunity, and encouraged the revolt. <span class="cmt_word">Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?</span> The meaning of these words, though somewhat obscure at first, becomes plain if we compare the two similar passages, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. In the first we have the contemptuous question, "Who is David?" and in the second the analogous one, "What portion have we in David?" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" and, "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." Here, therefore, it is clear that <span class="accented">Shechem</span> is merely another name for <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, "for he is our brother" (vers. 2, 3). <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or <span class="accented">the son of Shechem</span>, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, <span class="cmt_word">is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</span> (is not) <span class="cmt_word">Zebul his officer?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, <span class="cmt_word">No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem</span>. Fling off the yoke of the Abi-ezrite stranger, and set up a real Canaanite government from the old race of Hamor, the true founder and head of Shechem (cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-52</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-29.htm">Judges 9:29</a></div><div class="verse">And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.

It seems that the people at once closed with his offer, and, thus emboldened, he sent a challenge to Abimelech to come out and fight him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-30.htm">Judges 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Zebul</span>, etc. Zebul, it appears, was governor of the city under Abimelech, and when the words of Gaal were reported to him, he privately sent off messengers to the king to tell him the state of affairs at Shechem, and urge him to come in person. Zebul meanwhile temporised, not being strong enough to resist Gaal openly. <span class="cmt_word">Privily</span>. The word only occurs here.

But whatever the cause was, as soon as he was there, Abimelech, according to Zebul's advice in ver. 33, had begun to descend from the mountains into the valley to "set upon the city." Gaal's quick eye detected them in the morning light. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-36.htm">Judges 9:36</a></div><div class="verse">And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains.

The word rendered <span class="accented">middle</span> only occurs again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>, "the midst of the land," A.V. It is so rendered from the notion of the old interpreters that it was connected with a word meaning "<span class="accented">the navel."</span> It is usually explained now to mean <span class="accented">the height</span>. There may have been some particular height in the ridge called <span class="accented">Tabbur ha-aretz. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The plain of Meonenim</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">the oak</span> (or terebinth tree) <span class="accented">of the soothsayers</span>, some large terebinth or turpentine tree under which the soothsayers used to take their auguries.

Abimelech's spies in the city being aware of their intention immediately reported it to him. Upon which he hastily took his army, divided them as before into three companies, lay in ambush in the field till the Shechemites were well out in the country, then attacked the Shechemites in the field with two of the companies, and himself at the head of the third rushed to the city gate to intercept their retreat.

The city made an obstinate defence notwithstanding, but was taken before night, and all the inhabitants were put to the sword. The walls were then razed to the ground, and the site was sown with salt to express the wish that it might be barren and uninhabited for ever (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>, marg.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>). This action of sowing with salt is not elsewhere mentioned; but it is well known that salt destroys vegetation, and is used by gardeners for this very purpose.

In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb <span class="accented">all.</span> Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, <span class="accented">and all to-brake his skull.</span> It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> had become entirely obsolete, and the compound <span class="accented">all-to</span> had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">and all-to brake his skull</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> smashed it, dashed it in pieces.

It is remarkable that the sacred writer, in calling attention to the righteous vengeance which fell upon the head of Abimelech, marks especially the conduct of Abimelech as undutiful to his father (see <a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24-26</a>).

Not here <span class="accented">baaley</span>, but simply men. Each such evidence of the righteous judgment of God is a presage of the judgment to come, and encourages the reflection of the Psalmist: "Verily there is a reward for the righteous; doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, Pr. B. vers.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
