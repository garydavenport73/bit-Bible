With passionate Oriental feelings they passed the whole day weeping, and probably fasting (see ch. 20:26), before the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Wept sore</span>. Hebrew, <span class="accented">wept a great weeping.</span> The expression <span class="cmt_word">lifted up their voices</span> shows that it was a loud wailing and lamentation,

The existence of the twelve tribes was an essential part of their covenant existence as the people of God (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3, 4</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>, etc.).

The idea evidently occurred to them that they might supply wives to the 600 Benjamites in the way that actually came to pass, and they asked the question, <span class="accented">Who is there among all the tribes</span>, etc., with this view. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel</span>, etc. This verse goes back a little to explain why the children of Israel asked the question, viz., because they repented them for Benjamin, and wished to repair the mischief resulting from their rash oath not to give their daughters to a Benjamite; therefore they said (repeating ver. 5), What one is there that came not up to Mizpeh? (ver. 8) and on numbering the people it was found that no one had come up from Jabesh-gilead. This is the first time that <span class="cmt_word">Jabesh-gilead</span> is mentioned in Scripture. It comes up twice afterwards. First in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>, on occasion of its being besieged by the Ammonites and rescued by Saul; and secondly in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>, when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shah, and buried them at Jabesh, for which brave and pious act David thanked them (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>). The name of <span class="accented">Jabesh</span> is only preserved in the Wady <span class="accented">Yabis</span>, which debouches on the eastern bank of the Jordan about lat. 32'24. Robinson thinks the ruins called ed Deir in this valley are the remains of Jabesh, which agrees exactly with the situation assigned to it by Eusebius in the , Onomasticon.'

They followed in the severity of the punishment the precedent of the destruction of the Midianites (see <a href="../../par/numbers/31-17.htm">Numbers 31:17</a>), and even in the numbers sent to destroy them - a thousand from every tribe (<a href="../../par/numbers/31-5.htm">Numbers 31:5</a>). Revolting to our feelings as such wholesale massacres are, including women and children, it must be remembered in mitigation that the '<span class="accented">hereto</span> was the solemn devotion of a thing or person to destruction under the sanction of an oath. <span class="cmt_word">Of the valiantest</span>. <span class="accented">The sons of valour</span> simply means <span class="accented">valiant men</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-10.htm">2 Samuel 17:10</a>).

It is rather more in accordance with the Hebrew style to take the words as the narrator's explanation of the question, <span class="accented">What shall we do?</span> They said this because all the women of Benjamin had been destroyed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a></div><div class="verse">And they said, <i>There must be</i> an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin</span>. The passage is difficult to construe and to explain. If the words <span class="accented">There must be</span> are properly supplied in the A.V., the sense will come out more clearly if we take the word <span class="accented">inheritance</span> to mean rather <span class="accented">succession</span>, which is the idea contained in the root. <span class="accented">There must be a succession for the escaped of Benjamin</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there must be heirs to succeed, and therefore we must find wives for them. <span class="accented">The word peleytah</span> without the article can hardly mean <span class="accented">the remnant</span>, as has been proposed, but must be defined by being taken with <span class="accented">Benjamin.</span>

Note again the evil of rash vows, and how often chicanery is necessary in order to evade their evil consequences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then they said, Behold, <i>there is</i> a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly <i>in a place</i> which <i>is</i> on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly</span>. Compare the exactly similar description, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 7</a>. There is a great difference of opinion among commentators as to what feast is here meant. Hengstenberg, Keil, Delitzsch, and others think it was the passover; Bishop Patrick and others think it was the feast of tabernacles, a more joyous feast; Rosenmuller and others think it was a festival peculiar to Shiloh, after the analogy of the yearly sacrifice of the family of Jesse at Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>), and more or less in accordance with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-12</a>. It is not easy to say which view is right, but the last seems not improbable, <span class="cmt_word">In a place which is on the north side</span>, etc. The words <span class="accented">in a place</span> are not in the Hebrew, and do not seem to be implied by the context. But the description is that of the situation of Shiloh itself, which is very exact (see 'Palestine Exploration Fund,' Map of West Palestine). <span class="cmt_word">Lebonah</span> survives in el-Lubbun, about two miles north-west of Seilun, and to the west of the road to Shechem or Nablus. It seems strange that so particular a description of the situation of Shiloh should be given; but it may probably indicate that the writer lived after the tabernacle had been moved to Jerusalem, and Shiloh had relapsed into an obscure village (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). The situation of the descriptive words in the Hebrew, with the pronoun <span class="accented">which</span>, separated from <span class="accented">Shiloh</span> by the word <span class="accented">yearly</span>, indicates that they are an explanation added by the narrator. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-20.htm">Judges 21:20</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a></div><div class="verse">And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come out</span>. The verb is in the masculine gender, though <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span> is the subject (see above, ver. 12, note), To dance in dances. Bishop Patrick says that the feast of tabernacles was the only feast at which Jewish maidens were permitted to dance. Go to the land of Benjamin. The close vicinity of the high road leading from Shechem to Bethel on the border of Benjamin would facilitate their flight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-22.htm">Judges 21:22</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <i>that</i> ye should be guilty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be favourable unto them for our sakes</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">Grant us them as a favour</span>, the masculine <span class="accented">them</span> referring to <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 12, and the verb <span class="accented">grant a favour</span> being followed by a double accusative. <span class="cmt_word">We reserved not to each man his wife</span>, etc. These words are somewhat difficult. If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before <span class="accented">each</span> <span class="accented">man</span> (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the <span class="accented">to</span> is not natural in such a phrase (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> is hardly to the point, nor is <a href="../../par/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, where the <span class="accented">to</span> had been expressed before the us), and <span class="accented">reserved</span> is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: "We received not each man his wife in the war." Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, "Grant them to us," etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, "<span class="accented">because</span> THEY received not each man his wife," etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not give</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not <span class="accented">give</span> your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force. The A.V. gives the probable meaning of the passage, though it is somewhat obscure.
