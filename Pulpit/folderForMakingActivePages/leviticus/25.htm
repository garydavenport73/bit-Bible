The words mean only, "in the Sinai district;" and they are employed because these laws form the conclusion of the series of laws given while the people were en-camped under Mount Sinai. The law on vows is, it is true, added to them, but it is by way of appendix. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-7.</span> - The sabbath of the seventh year could only be observed <span class="cmt_word">when ye come into the land which I give you.</span> The habit of making no distraction in the seventh year during the whole of the life in the wilderness may have led to the neglect of the law after the settlement in Canaan. Another excuse for the neglect may have been a difficulty which would have presented itself of fixing the date from which to count up to the seventh year, as different parts of the land were conquered at different times. According to the law, from New Year's Day of the seventh year (the 1st of Tisri, which occurred about the middle of September) to the following New Year's Day, there was to be neither sowing nor pruning, reaping or gathering. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou gather the grapes of thy vine undressed,</span> would be more literally rendered, <span class="accented">the grapes of thy Nazarite vine</span>, the vine with its unpruned tendrils, being likened to the Nazarite with his unshorn locks. As to sowing and reaping, an exception was made with respect to the barley sown and reaped for the Passover sheaf, and the wheat sown and reaped for the Pentecost loaves. The spontaneous fruits of the earth, and they were very large in the rich fields of the valleys and plains, were to be the property of all alike, whether the owners of the land or not, "that the poor of thy people might eat" (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>). And what was left by man was to be food for the cattle and beasts of the field. The cessation of agricultural labours must have served, and may have been intended to serve, as an encouragement to mercantile pursuits, as well as to the study of the Divine Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles of the seventh year was specially appointed by Moses as a day for reading the Law to the assembled people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). And the Mishna appoints the following passages of Deuteronomy to be read on that day: - <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27, 28</a>. ('Mish. Sotah.,' 7:8). The other ordinance connected with the sabbatical year, the release of debts to the poor (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-6</a>), was, like the fifth commandment, made of none effect by rabbinical traditions  - notably by one which required a debtor, when his creditor said, "I remit," to insist that nevertheless he should accept payment. The moral purpose of the sabbath of the seventh year is well drawn out by Keil: - "In the sabbatical year the land which the Lord had given his people was to observe a period of holy rest and refreshment to its Lord and God, just as the congregation did on the sabbath day; and the hand of man was to be withheld from the fields and fruit gardens from working them that they might yield their produce for his use. The earth was to be sacred from the hand of man, exhausting its power for earthly purposes as his own property, and to enjoy the holy rest with which God had blessed the earth and all its productions after the Creation. From this, Israel, as the nation of God, was to learn, on the one hand, that although the earth was created for man, it was not merely created for him to draw out its power for his own use, but also to be holy to the Lord and participate in the blessed rest; and on the other hand, that the great purpose for which the congregation of the Lord existed did not consist in the uninterrupted tilling of the earth, connected with bitter labour in the sweat of the brow (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17, 19</a>), but in the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, which the Lord their God had given them and would give them still, without the labour of their hands, if they strove to keep his covenant and satisfy themselves with his grace."

The question, <span class="cmt_word">What shall we eat?</span> would present itself with double force when the sabbatical and the jubilee years came together.

Palestine was God's land: he divided it once for all in the time of Joshua among his people, and every fifty years he required that recourse should be had to that original division, in order that in each generation the people might feel themselves to be his tenants, not independent owners, <span class="accented">possessores</span>, not <span class="accented">domini.</span>

Houses in cities, being occupied by artisans and built by human industry, not originally assigned in the territorial division, are not considered in so strict a sense the property of the Lord as the soil is, and may be parted with more readily. Yet the owners, if obliged to part with them, are allowed a year's grace, during which they are to have the right of buying them back. The expression, within <span class="cmt_word">a full year</span>, would be more literally rendered <span class="accented">during a fixed time</span>, that fixed time having just before been declared to be a year.

They constituted the share of the national property which was assigned to the tribe of Levi, and so far stood in the same relation to them as the land did to the other tribes. They therefore returned to the original possessor or his representative in the year of jubilee, and might at any earlier time be redeemed. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,</span> should rather be rendered, <span class="accented">But in respect to the cities of the Levites.</span> There is a difficulty also as to the translation of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">And if a man purchase of the Levites,</span> for the word rendered <span class="accented">purchase</span> menus elsewhere <span class="accented">redeem</span>; but here the Authorized Version would seem to be correct. The sense that it gives is that if any one bought a house of the Levites, he had to render it back in the year of jubilee, just as though it had been land. On the other hand, the land belonging to the Levites, in the suburbs of the Levitical cities, which was used for the pasturage of the flocks of the Levites, could not be sold except to a Levite, and therefore no question between the Levites and members of the other tribes could arise regarding it. The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the house that was sold, and the city of his possession,</span> must be understood, by a hendiadys, to mean, <span class="accented">the house that was sold in the city of his possession</span> (see Gesenius, 'Lex.,' s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> i.b.).

It is presumed that no Hebrew will become a slave except on the pressure of poverty, and this poverty his brethren are commanded to relieve; but foreseeing that either want of charity on the part of the rich or unthrift on the part of the poor would certainly bring about slavery, the legislator makes regulations so as to soften its character as far as possible. The literal translation of verse 35 is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth by thee, thou shalt lay hold of him; a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee.</span> The translation of the latter clause adopted by the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner</span>; <span class="accented">that he may live with thee</span>, makes the duty of giving charitable support and loans of money to apply to the case of the stranger and sojourner as well as of the Israelite. The other and more probable rendering confines its application to native Israelites. <span class="accented">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth, thou shalt support him as a stranger or a sojourner</span>, that is, treat him with the forbearance shown to resident foreigners, to whose state he had reduced himself by the loss of his land. The command in verse 36, <span class="cmt_word">Take thou no usury of him, or increase,</span> does not bear upon the general question of taking interest for money when lent to wealthy men or companies for business purposes. It simply forbids the taking of interest or increase of a brother Israelite who had become poor. The history of Rome shows how much cruelty and revolution such an injunction may have prevented. The words, <span class="accented">or increase</span>, added to <span class="accented">usury</span>, forbid the exaction of any greater quantity of food or clothing (a method of evading the law against usury) than that which had been lent. The injunction was transgressed in the time of Nehemiah, when "he rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother....

But the fact that an Israelite could not be kept in slavery for more than six years (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>), and that the period of his service had to be still shorter if the jubilee fell before the seventh year, and the further fact that at the time of the jubilee he would not only he free, but recover any ancestral property that he had forfeited, so that he might become once more on an equality with his master, would have made his position totally different from the hopeless, helpless state of the Greek or Roman slave, even without the positive command that he was to be treated, not <span class="cmt_word">as a bondservant:</span> but <span class="cmt_word">as an hired servant,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">as a sojourner.</span> All alike, master and bondsman, were the slaves of God, and therefore not only were they, so far, on an equality one with another, but the master would be encroaching on the right of God if he claimed God's slaves for his own inalienably.

He may be redeemed by the value of his work down to the jubilee being paid by himself or his kinsman; he is to be set free when the jubilee comes at any rate; he is to be treated kindly while continuing in his master's service, and his countrymen are to see that no over-severity is used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
