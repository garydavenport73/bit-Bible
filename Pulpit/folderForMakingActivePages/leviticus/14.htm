This is the most minute of all the forms of purification, those for purification from contact with a dead body (<a href="../../par/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>) and for the cleansing of a defiled Nazarite (<a href="../../par/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>) being alone to be compared with it in this respect. Some purifications were accomplished, as we have seen, in a very summary manner: one who touched the carcass of a beast that had died a natural death had only to wash his clothes (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a>). The greater and more significative the defilement, the more careful and the more significative must be the cleansing. Leprous uncleanness excluded the leper both from the camp and from the sanctuary, from the rights both of citizen. ship and of Church-membership, with which the rights of the family were also associated; consequently there had to be a double form of restoration, each with its special ceremonies. The manner of the first reconciliation is detailed in verses 1-8, of the second in verses 9-32.

In later times it was ordered that the examination was not to take place on the sabbath, nor in the early morning, nor in the late afternoon, nor inside a house, nor on a cloudy day, nor in the glare of midday, and that the priest must have good eyesight, and only determine one case at a time; nor was he allowed to pronounce judgment on his own kindred. <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper.</span> The plague of leprosy is healed before the ceremony of purification begins, but the leper is not <span class="accented">pronounced clean</span> until he has been sprinkled with the blood and water (verse 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive <i>and</i> clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.</span> "Cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet ' are also to be burnt with the red heifer for the ashes for the water of separation (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>), and they appear to have been commonly employed in purifications (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). The antiseptic properties of cedar made it peculiarly suitable for such occasions. The hyssop "was probably not the plant which we call hyssop, the <span class="accented">Hyssopus officinalis.</span> for it is uncertain whether this is to be found in Syria and Arabia, but a species of <span class="accented">origanum</span> resembling hyssop, the Arabian <span class="accented">zater</span>, either wild marjoram, or a kind of thyme" (Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschExodus 12:21). The Psalmist's cry, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be chart" (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>), shows the common use to which it was put. In the present case, the sweet smell both of the wood (one cubit's length of which was used) and of the herb would have still further adapted them for symbolizing the redemption of the leper's flesh from corruption and putrefaction. The <span class="accented">scarlet</span> was probably a band of scarlet wool with which the cedar and the hyssop were tied - not to the bird (for we have no account of their being after, wards removed), but (as in the burning of the red heifer) one to the other. The colour of the wool was appropriate, not only because it was about to be dipped in the blood and water, but also because it symbolized the purified and now healthy blood.

It was to be <span class="accented">running</span>, literally, <span class="accented">living</span>, water; that is, fresh water taken from a fountain or a running stream, in order that it might be as pure as possible. Symbolically, the cleansing power of water as well as of blood is indicated.

It had been his office to declare the man a leper, and thereby to shut him out from the people of the Lord (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-8.htm">Leviticus 13:8, 15, 22, 25, 36, 44, 46</a>). Now he pronounces him to be no leper, and therefore, after some further ceremonies, readmits him (verses 8, 20, 31). <span class="cmt_word">And shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</span> The symbolism of the two birds, which has been much misinterpreted, is essentially the same as that of the two goats on the day of atonement, though each ceremony has its distinctive features. The <span class="accented">killing</span> of the living bird was not a true sacrifice, as was the offering of the goat to Jehovah, but by its death it represented the state in which the leper had legally been, and to which he would have been physically reduced had not a remedy been found. The deathly and unclean state of the leper having been symbolically transferred from the dead bird to the living bird by the latter's being sprinkled in the former's blood, the living bird stands in the position of the scapegoat, on whom the sins of the people were laid. The bird is then <span class="accented">let loose into the open field</span>; literally, <span class="accented">upon the face of the field</span>; and it flies off, carrying with it the leper's uncleanness, and assuring him by every forward movement that it makes that the living death has passed from him, just as each step or' the scapegoat appeared to the Israelites to remove their sins from them. A large number of commentators, on the other hand, consider the released bird to symbolize the health and freedom now given back to the leper, and they dwell on the rapid and uncontrolled movement of birds as being peculiarly suitable for representing this recovered liberty. But this interpretation, to which there are many objections, appears to be altogether incompatible with the fact that the same ceremony is used in the cleansing of the leprous house, whereas the house could certainly not be represented as "recovered to unrestrained liberty" (Lunge). The common patristic view, that the two birds represent the two natures of the one Great Sacrifice offered to redeem man from sin, seems to be out of place here.

The whole nation was in a sense a priestly nation, and the restoration of the lapsed member to his rights was therefore a quasi-consecration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour <i>for</i> a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour.</span> Every sacrifice is to be provided and offered by the restored leper, except the peace offering. It is certainly singular that the peace offering should be omitted, and that the trespass offering should be required. The former fact may be accounted for by the supposition that though the peace offering was not required, the late leper was, after his other sacrifices, put in a position where he might offer it when he would of his own free will. But the requirement of the trespass offering is more difficult to explain. What wrong had the leper done? and what satisfaction had he to make? The usual answer to this question is that he had wronged Jehovah in that, however involuntarily, he had failed to bring him the offerings and service which he would have brought had he not been excluded from the camp. But this is a very forced explanation, and it is incompatible with other parts of the Law. For the leper was not the only unclean person who, owing to his uncleanness, was prevented from offering his gifts and worship at the tabernacle or temple. The woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years (<a href="../../par/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43</a>) during that time would have been excluded from the sanctuary. But no trespass offering is required of those that have been unclean through issues. We must therefore, look for some other explanation of the requirement in the case of the cleansed leper. And a simpler one is at hand. Leprosy was the type of sin - or all sin whatsoever. When, therefore, the expiatory sacrifices were demanded, both kinds - the trespass offering and the sin offering - had to be offered, because expiation had to be made for the uncleanness which represented all unrighteousness - trespasses as well as sins. It might be that the man had not committed a trespass; he might also not hive committed sin; but he had been stricken with the foul disease which symbolized both one and the other, and therefore he had to offer on his cleansing the sacrifice appropriate to each. There is a difference in the ritual of the trespass offering in the present ease, intended perhaps to distinguish it from those trespass offerings which were made when a man had in his mind a certain wrong or injury which he had committed, and for which he wished to make compensation. On this occasion <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the animal presented was not required to be of a particular value, as in the ordinary trespass offerings; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it was waved, whereas the ordinary trespass offerings were not waved; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it was waved by the priest, whereas other wave offerings were waved not by the priest, but by the offerer, whose bands were guided by the priests. Nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> did the offering of oil accompany the presentation of other trespass offerings. For whatever reason it be, the most characteristic feature of the sacrificial cleansing of the leper is the trespass offering, and the way that it was dealt with.

Two priests catch up the blood one in a vessel, the other in his band. He who catches it up in the vessel goes and throws it on the side of the altar, and he who catches it in his hand goes and stands before the leper. And the leper who had previously bathed in the court of the lepers, goes and stands in the gate of Nicanor. Rabbi Jehudah says he needs not bathe. He thrusts in his head (viz. into the great court, which he may not yet enter), and the priest puts of the blood upon the tip of his ear; he thrusts in his hand, and he puts it upon the thumb of his hand; he thrusts in his foot, and he puts it upon the great toe of his foot" ('Negaim,' 14:7, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 18.). No doubt, the ear, the thumb, and the great toe are selected for the purpose of showing, as in the case of the consecration of the priest, that the senses and the active powers of the restored Israelite must be dedicated hence, forth to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-15.htm">Leviticus 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the priest shall take <i>some</i> of the log of oil, and pour <i>it</i> into the palm of his own left hand:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.</span> This ceremony is altogether peculiar to this purification. The joint use of blood and oil is not singular (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>), but elsewhere there is no <span class="cmt_word">sprinkling of the oil...  seven times before the Lord,</span> and in the consecration of priests there was no anointing of the different members with oil as well as with blood. The Mishua (as before cited) continues the description of the ceremony as follows: - "The priest now takes from the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his colleague, though if he poured it into his own it were valid. He dips his finger and sprinkles seven times towards the holy of holies, dipping each time he sprinkles. He goes before the leper, and on the spot where he had put the blood he puts the oil, as it is written, 'Upon the blood of the trespass offering.' And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand, he pours on the head of him that is cleansed, for an atonement; if he so puts it, he is atoned for, but if not, he is not atoned for. So Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Jochanan, the son of Nuri, saith, This is only the remnant of the ordinance, whether it be done or not, the atonement is made; but they impute it to him (the priest), as if he had not made atonement." The double sprinkling with blood and oil betokened dedication as in the case of the priests, the blood specially denoting reconciliation, and the oil the strengthening power of God by which the new life was to be led.

The subject of leprosy in houses must be regarded from the same point of view as that of leprosy in clothes. The regulations respecting it are not sanitary laws, as Lange represents them, but rest, as Keil argues, upon an ideal or symbolical basis. The same thought is attached to all species of uncleanness. Something - it matters not what - produces a foul and repulsive appearance in the walls of a house. That is in itself sufficient to make that house unclean; for whatever is foul and repulsive is representative of moral and spiritual defilement, and therefore is itself symbolically defiling and defiled. It has been suggested that the special cause of the affection of the houses in Canaan was saltpetre exuding from the materials employed in their building, or iron pyrites in the stone used. This may have been so, or more probably it was the growth of some fungus. Whatever it was, the appearance created by it was so similar to that of leprosy in the human body, as to derive its name from the latter by analogy.
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-34.htm">Leviticus 14:34</a></div><div class="verse">When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession.</span> This is the first instance of a law being given which has no bearing on the present condition of the Israelites. but is to regulate their conduct when they had come into the promised land. From the time of Abraham downwards, the assurance of their entrance into that land had been possessed by the people of Israel (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>), and the expectation of the speedy fulfillment of that promise had been quickened by their exodus from Egypt, and the preparations made to march through the wilderness. There would, therefore, be nothing surprising to them in receiving instructions to guide their conduct when the entrance should have been effected. As the question is one of leprosy, it is natural that it should be treated of with the leprosy of the human subject and the leprosy of garments; but as it is not of immediate application, it is placed at the end, and dealt with after the rest of the subject has been discussed, being appended to the law of cleansing the leper, instead of preceding it. <span class="cmt_word">And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession.</span> This expression has led to the idea that the leprosy of houses was a special infliction at God's hand in a manner different flora other inflictions or diseases; but the words do not mean that. All that is done is in a sense done by God, inasmuch as his providence rules over all; and, therefore, by whatever secondary cause a thing may be brought about, it is he that does it. It is God that feeds the birds (<a href="../../par/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>), God that clothes the grass (<a href="../../par/luke/12-28.htm">Luke 12:28</a>), nor does one sparrow fall to the ground without him (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). It is he, therefore, that <span class="accented">puts the plague in a house</span>, as the Lord of all things (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6, 7</a>, "I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things"). The expression militates, though not strongly, against the notion that the house caught the leprosy from the leper that lived in it.

First, the house is to be emptied of its furniture, lest the latter should contract a ceremonial uncleanness in case the house were found to be leprous, but not, it will be noted, lest it should convey contagion or infection. Then the priest is to examine the discolouration, and if it bear a suspicious appearance, the house is to be shut up for seven days. It at the end of that time the spot has spread, he is to have the part of the wall in which it shows itself taken down and carried away, and built up again with new stones and mortar and plaster, the parts adjoining to the infected place having been first well scraped.
