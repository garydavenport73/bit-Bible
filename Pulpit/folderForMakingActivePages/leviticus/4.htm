At the time of the Mosaic legislation, burnt offerings and meat offerings were already in existence, and had existed from the time of the Fall. A beginning, therefore, is made with them, and the regulations of the peace offerings naturally follow, because these sacrifices succeed in order to the burnt and meat offerings, and because sacrifices in some respects of the same nature as peace offerings had previously existed under a different name (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/10-25.htm">Exodus 10:25</a> with <a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and see above notes on chapter 3). The sin and trespass offerings, therefore, are left to the last, though, owing to their meaning, they were always offered first of all, when sacrifices of all three kinds were made together. They are the means of ceremonially propitiating God when alienated from his people, or from any individual member of it, by sin, which they legally atone for. The need of expiation is implied and suggested by the offering of the blood, both in the burnt sacrifice and the peace offering (cf. <a href="../../par/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). But this was not sufficient; there must be a special sacrifice to teach this great truth as its primary lesson. The sin offering typifies the sacrifice of our Lord JESUS CHRIST upon the cross, as the great Sin Offering for mankind, whereby the wrath of God was propitiated, and an expiation for the sins of man was wrought, bringing about reconciliation between God and man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD <i>concerning things</i> which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a soul shall sin.</span> The conditions to be fulfilled in presenting a sin offering differed according to the position held by the offerer in the state. If it were the high priest, he had <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to offer a young bull in the court of the tabernacle; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to place his hand upon it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to kill it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to take the blood into the holy place of the tabernacle, and there sprinkle some of it seven times in the direction of the vail that divided off the holy of holies within which the ark was placed, and to smear some of it on the horns of the golden altar of incense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> to pour out the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offering in the court of the tabernacle; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> to burn all the internal fat upon the altar of burnt offering; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> to carry the whole of the remainder of the animal outside the camp, and there to burn it. If it were the congregation that made the offering, the same conditions had to be fulfilled, except that the elders of the congregation had to lay their hands on the animal. If it were a ruler, the animal offered was to be a male kid, and the priest, instead of taking the blood into the sanctuary, was to smear it on the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice in the court. If it were an ordinary member of the congregation, the animal was to be a female kid, or ewe lamb, which was to be dealt with in the same manner; or in some cases two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering (whose blood was all sprinkled round the inner side of the altar), the other for a burnt offering (which was to be treated according to the ritual of the burnt offering), or even the tenth part of an ephah of flour (without oil or frankincense), a handful of which was to be burnt, and the remainder delivered to the priest for his consumption. The moral lesson taught to the Jew by the sin offering was of the terrible nature of sin, and of the necessity for an expiation for it in addition to penitence. Mystically he might see that, as the blood of bulls and goats could not of its own virtue take away sin, there must be an offering, foreshadowed by the sacrifice of the animals, which should be effectual as these were symbolical The type is fulfilled by the atonement wrought by Christ's blood shed on the cross (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-21</a>). Further, the ceremonial cleansing of the sinful Israelite by the sin offering in the old dispensation foreshadows the effect of baptism in the new dispensation, for, as Calvin has noted in his Commentary, "As sins are now sacramentally washed away by baptism, so under the Law also sacrifices were expiations, although in a different way." <span class="cmt_word">If a soul shall sin through ignorance.</span> The expression, "through ignorance" (<span class="accented">bishgagah</span>), is intended to cover all sins except those committed "with a high hand," or defiantly, whether the agent was ignorant that they were sins or was led into them by inconsiderateness or infirmity (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12, 13</a>, "Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins"). A better translation of <span class="accented">bishgagah</span> would be <span class="accented">by want of consideration</span>, or <span class="accented">by inadvertence.</span> Our Lord could say, even of those who crucified him, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;" and therefore even for them a sin offering might be made and be accepted. But for deliberate and determined sin the Law has no atonement, no remedy. The words, <span class="cmt_word">shall do against any of them</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, against the commandments, would be better rendered <span class="accented">shall do any of them</span>, i.e., the things <span class="cmt_word">which ought not to be done.</span> There is no exact apodosis to this verse; it is a general heading to the chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-12.</span> - The case of the high priest. He is designated the <span class="cmt_word">priest that is anointed</span>, in respect to which title, see notes on chapter 8. In case he sins in his representative character, his sin is such as <span class="accented">to bring guilt on the people</span> (this is the meaning of the words translated <span class="cmt_word">according to the sin of the people</span>), and a special sin offering must therefore be made. He is to <span class="cmt_word">take of the blood</span> of the animal sacrificed, and <span class="cmt_word">bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:...  and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense.</span> This was a more solemn method of presenting the blood to the Lord than that used in the burnt offering; the offering of the blood, which was the vehicle of life, being the chief feature in the sin offering, as the consumption of the whole animal by the altar fire was in the burnt offering. In the burnt offerings and peace offerings the blood was thrown once on the altar of burnt sacrifice (see chapter Leviticus 1:5); now it is sprinkled, in a smaller quantity each <span class="accented">time</span>, but as often as seven times (the number seven symbolically representing completeness), before the vail which shrouded the ark. <span class="accented">The altar of sweet incense</span> is the golden altar, which stood within the tabernacle, in front of the vail. Perhaps the reason why <span class="accented">the horns of the altar</span> are specially appointed to have the blood placed on them is that they were regarded as the most sacred part of the altar, because they were its highest points, in which its elevation towards heaven culminated. The remainder of the victim's blood is to be poured <span class="cmt_word">at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering</span>, in the court of the tabernacle, to sink into the ground, because no more of it was wanted for ceremonial use. The internal fat is to be burnt upon the altar of the burnt offering, but not actually upon the smoldering burnt sacrifice, as in the case of the peace offerings; the sin offering preceding the burnt offering in order of time, while the peace offering followed it. The remainder of the animal <span class="cmt_word">is to be carried without the camp...  and be burnt</span>, because its flesh was at once accursed and most holy. It was accursed, as having been symbolically the vehicle of the sins laid upon it by the offerer; therefore it must not be consumed upon the altar of God, but be destroyed with fire outside the camp, typifying the removal from God's kingdom, and the final destruction of all that is sinful. But yet it was most holy, as its blood had been taken into the tabernacle, and had served as a propitiation; therefore, if it had to be burnt, it yet had to be burnt solemnly, reverently, and as a ceremonial act, in a place appointed for the purpose. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that one of the points in which our Lord was the antitype of the sin offering was that he "suffered without the gate," "that he might sanctify the people with his own blood" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), which was thus indicated to have been carried within the sanctuary, that is, into heaven.
