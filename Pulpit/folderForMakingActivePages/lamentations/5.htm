The expressions are forcible, but inexact. The land was seized; the houses were destroyed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>).

Hence in the next clause the mothers of Israel ere likened to widows.

Persecution is here compared to a yoke. But this rendering and explanation hardly  suit the phrase, which rather means, "<span class="accented">We</span> are pursued close upon our necks." The harassing conduct of the Babylonian conquerors is compared to the pursuit of a foe fast gaining upon a fugitive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-6.htm">Lamentations 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">We have given the hand <i>to</i> the Egyptians, <i>and to</i> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have given the hand,</span> etc. Starvation awaits the Jews unless they submit to one or the other of their hereditary foes. Some escape to Egypt and "give the hand" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> surrender, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>) to the lords of the fertile Nile valley; others acquiesce in the fate of the majority, and sue for the alms of the Babylonians.

This view of national troubles is very clearly endorsed by one important class of passages (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The objection to it is forcibly expressed by Job (<a href="../../par/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), "God [it is said] layeth up his iniquity for his children: [but] let him requite it to himself, that he may feel it!" Hence Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-1.htm">Ezekiel 18:1</a>, etc.) insist on the truth that every man is punished for his own sins. Of course the two views of punishment are reconcilable. The Jews were not only punished, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11, 12</a>, for their fathers' sins, but for their own still more flagrant offences. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-8.htm">Lamentations 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Servants have ruled over us: <i>there is</i> none that doth deliver <i>us</i> out of their hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Servants have ruled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">slaves.</span> The Babylonians in general might be called slaves, by comparison with the "kingdom of priests" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), and the "sons" of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>). Or the expression may mean that even baseborn hangers on of the conquering host assumed the right to command the defenceless captives.

Impalement after death was a common punishment with the Assyrians and Babylonians. Thus Sennacherib says that, after capturing rebellious Ekron, he hung the bodies of the chief men on stakes all round the city ('Records of the Past,' 1:38). Benomi gives a picture of such an impalement from one of the plates in Botta's great work ('Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 192).

Dr. Thomson "cannot recall an instance in which men were grinding at the mill" ('The Land and the Book,' edit. 1881, p. 108), and both <a href="../../par/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a> presuppose that it was women's work.

Jeremiah has a similar phrase in his prophecies (Jeremiah 13:18). It evidently expresses figuratively the prosperity and honour formerly enjoyed by the now vanquished people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-17.htm">Lamentations 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">For this our heart is faint; for these <i>things</i> our eyes are dim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - These verses form a transition to the final appeal.

The poet does not say," Wherefore hast thou forgotten us?" One of the psalmists, indeed, does go so far (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>); but the poet of this lamentation, with a more tender and trustful reserve, adopts the tense of feeling (the imperfect) in preference to that of fact (the perfect), and asks, "Wherefore dost thou [to my feeling] forget us? Wherefore, if Jehovah's power is still unbroken, does he allow Israel to feel herself forsaken?" The fact is certain, viz. that the land of Israel is desolate, and (the poet seems to imply) desolate for some time already. The interpretation is hypothetical, and, as the last verse will show, the poet cannot bring himself to believe that it can be accurate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-21.htm">Lamentations 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn thou us,</span> etc. Not "bring us back to thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the sacred land (as Thenius), for it is not a speech of the exiles, but of the Jews left behind, at least for the present, in Judea. "Turn thou us" means "Bring us into a state of reconciliation with thee" The next petition, <span class="cmt_word">Renew our days as of old,</span> means, "Restore the old happy mode of life, each man with his own vine and his own fig tree, undisturbed by the fear of invasion, and rejoicing in the sense of the favour of Jehovah." The first petition has the priority because only on repentance and recovered purity of heart and life can Jerusalem rise from her ashes. Isaiah had said this long ago (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26, 27</a>), and the elegiac poet repeats it (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-22.htm">Lamentations 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unless</span>. The poet wishes to suggest that the idea seems to him inconsistent with the covenant relationship of Jehovah towards Israel. May we not compare a striking passage in Isaiah which should probably be rendered thus: "A wife of one's youth, can she be rejected? saith thy God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>)? Both passages express, in a most delicate way, the incredulity of the writers with regard to the absolute rejection of Israel. And thus this melancholy Book of Lamentations concludes with a hope, "faint, yet pursuing," of the final realization of the promises to Israel. The interpretation adopted admits of no reasonable doubt, in spite of the fact that ancient doctors of the synagogue thought otherwise when they established the custom of repeating ver. 21 after ver. 22 had been read, in order to soften the supposed gloomy impression of ver. 22. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../lamentations/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Lamentations 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Lamentations 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
