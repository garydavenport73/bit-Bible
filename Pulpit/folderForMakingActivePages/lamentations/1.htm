The characteristic introductory word of an elegy (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4, 12</a>), and adopted by the early Jewish divines as the title of the Book of Lamentations. It is repeated at the opening of ch. 2 and ch. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Sit solitary.</span> Jerusalem is poetically personified and distinguished from the persons who accidentally compose her population. She is "solitary," not as having retired into solitude, but as deserted by her inhabitants (same word as in first clause of <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">How is she become as a widow!</span> etc. Rather, <span class="accented">She is become a widow that was great among the nations; a princess among the provinces, she is become a vassal.</span> The alteration greatly conduces to the effect of the verse, which consists of three parallel lines, like almost all the rest of the chapter. We are not to press the phrase, "a widow," as if some. earthly or heavenly husband were alluded to; it is a kind of symbol of desolation and misery (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). "The provinces" at once suggests the period of the writer, who must have been a subject of the Babylonian empire. The term is also frequently used of the countries under the Persian rule (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1, 22</a>), and in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a> is used of Judah itself. Here, however, the "provinces," like the "nations," must be the countries formerly subject to David and Solomon (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears <i>are</i> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort <i>her</i>: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the night.</span> Not only by day, but even in the season of rest and unconsciousness. <span class="cmt_word">Her lovers...  her friends;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the neighbouring peoples, with which Judah had formed alliances, such as Egypt (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>), Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). This is a favourite phrase of Jeremiah's (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>), but also of Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 7, 10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:33, 36, 37; 23:5, 9, 22). The national God was conceived of as the Husband of the nation; and the prophets retained this idea and elevated it, just as they did circumcision and many other Eastern traditions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is gone into captivity because of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is gone into exile</span>, etc. The poet is not thinking of the deportation of the captives, but of those Jews who sought refuge for themselves in foreign lands (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). An objection has been raised to this view that the number of fugitive Jews would not be large enough to warrant their being called "Judah." But we might almost as well object on a similar ground to the application of the term "Judah" to the Jews who were carried to Babylon. The truth may, perhaps, be that, after the fall of Jerusalem, the Jewish nation became split up into three parts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews who succeeded in escaping into Egypt or elsewhere; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who were carried captive; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the mass of the common people, who remained on their native soil, Keil, however, retains the view of the Authorized Version, only substituting  "out of" for "because of." "Out of" the misery into which the Jews had been brought by the invasions of Necho and Nebuchadnezzar they passed into the new misery of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Among the heathen;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among the nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Between the straits.</span> The phrase is peculiar, and reminds us of <a href="../../par/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, "Out of the strait I called unto thee." "A strait," or narrow place, clearly means adversity, just as "a large place" (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>) means prosperity.

The reads leading to Jerusalem, usually so thronged with pilgrims, are desolate and "mourn" (comp. ch. 2:8 and <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All her gates are desolate.</span> No one goes in or out of Jerusalem, and there is no concourse of citizens in the shady recess of the gates. <span class="cmt_word">The virgins are afflicted.</span> So <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-18.htm">Zephaniah 3:18</a>. The sorrow was on account of the cessation of the festival, in the music of which they took a leading part (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are the chief;</span> rather, <span class="accented">are become the head.</span> Comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>, where, as a part of the curse of Israel's rebellion, it is foretold that "he [the stranger] shall become the head, and thou shalt become the tail." <span class="cmt_word">Before the enemy.</span> Like a herd of cattle.

An allusion to the attempted flight of Zedekiah and his companions (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-7.htm">Lamentations 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, <i>and</i> did mock at her sabbaths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembered;</span> rather, <span class="accented">remembereth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Miseries</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore she is removed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she is become an abomination</span> (literally, <span class="accented">an impurity</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). The poet leaves out the preliminary clause, "therefore she is grievously punished." It was the humiliation of Jerusalem, rather than her sin, which brought upon her the contempt of her neighbours. The destruction of a city is often compared to the ill treatment of a defenceless woman (<a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Her filthiness <i>is</i> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.

Some think that this verse relates solely to the miserable survivors. This is possible; at any rate, it includes the contemporaries of the writer. "Sigh" and "seek" are participles in the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">To relieve the soul;</span> literally, to <span class="accented">bring back the soul.</span> The "soul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the principle of life, is conceived of as having for a time deserted the fainting frame. <span class="cmt_word">See, O Lord,</span> etc. Another piteous cry of Jerusalem, preparing the way for the second half of the elegy.

Keil, however, adopts a rendering very near that of the Authorized Version "(Cometh it) not unto you?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Do ye not heed it?" Ewald supposes the phrase to be abbreviated from "Do I not call unto you?" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a>); but this would be a very harsh construction. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; the Targum, "I adjure you;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">O vos</span>; - all apparently pronouncing <span class="accented">lu</span> instead of <span class="accented">lo</span>.
