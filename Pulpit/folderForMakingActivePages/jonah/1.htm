<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nineveh</span>, the capital of the kingdom of Assyria, is first mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>, as founded by Nimrod. It stood on the left bank of the river Tigris, where it is joined by the Khosr, opposite to the present town of Mosul. The Assyrians had already become known in Syria. In  <span class="date">B.C. 854</span> Shal-maneser II. had defeated at Karkar twelve kings confederate against him, among whom is reckoned Ahab King of Israel. Long before his time, Tiglath-Pileser I. had made a great expedition to the west, captured a town at the foot of Lebanon, and reached the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Jehu was compelled to pay tribute to the Assyrians; and Rimmon-nirari, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 810</span> to 781, held the suzerainty of Phoenicia, Samaria, Edom, and Philistia. Jonah, therefore, knew well what his country might expect at the hands of this people. <span class="cmt_word">That great city.</span> It is thus called in <a href="../../par/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; and the epithet is added here in order to show to Jonah the importance of his mission. The size of Nineveh is variously estimated according to the sense attached to the name "Nineveh." This appellation may be restricted to Nineveh proper, or it may comprise the four cities which lay close together in the immediate neighbourhood of each other, and whose remains are now known as the mounds of <span class="accented">Kouyunjik</span>, on the southwest, directly opposite to Mosul; <span class="accented">Nimrud</span>, about eighteen miles to the southeast; <span class="accented">Karamless</span>, twelve miles to the north; and <span class="accented">Khorsabad</span>, the most northerly, about the same distance both from Karamless and Kouyunjik. Khorsabad, however, was not built till some hundred years after Jonah's time (Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 448). These cities are contained in an irregular parallelogram of some sixty miles in circumference. The following account of Nineveh proper is derived from Professor Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:252, etc.: "The ruins consist of two principal mounds, Nebbiyunus and Kouyunjik. The Kouyunjik mound, which lies nearly half a mile northwest of the others, is very much the more considerable of the two. Its shape is an irregular oval, elongated to a point towards the northeast. The surface is nearly flat; the sides slope at a steep angle, and are furrowed with numerous ravines worn in the soft material by the rains of some thirty centuries. The greatest height above the plain is ninety feet, and the area is estimated at a hundred acres. It is an artificial eminence, computed to contain 14,500,000 tons of earth, and on it were erected the palaces and temples of the Assyrian monarchs. The mound of Nebbi-yunus is at its base nearly triangular, and covers an area of nearly forty acres. It is loftier, and its sides are more precipitous than Kouyunjik, especially on the west, where it abutted on the wall of the city. The mass of earth is calculated at six and a half millions of tons. These two vast mounds are both in the same line, and  abutted on the western wall of the city, which was some two and a half miles in length. Anciently it seems to have immediately overhung the Tigris, but the river has now receded to the west, leaving a plain of nearly a mile in width between its bank and the old rampart which evidently once followed the course of the river bank. The western wall is joined at fight angles by the northern rampart which runs in a straight line for seven thousand feet. At its other extremity the western wall forms a very obtuse angle with the southern, which impends over a deep ravine, and runs in a straight line for about a thousand yards, when it meets the eastern wall, which is the longest and the least regular of the four. The entire length of this side is sixteen thousand feet, or above three miles. It is divided into two portions by. the Stream of the Khosr-su; which, coming from the northwest, finds its way through the city and then across the low plain to the Tigris. The town is thus of an oblong shape, and the circuit of its walls is somewhat less than eight miles, and the area which they include is eighteen hundred acres. This, at the computation of something less than one hundred inhabitants per acre, would ascribe to Nineveh a population of one hundred and seventy-five thousand souls" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 1. ch. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Cry against it.</span> The message is given in <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>. Thus the knowledge of the true God is made known among the Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">Their wickedness;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Pusey notes, their evil doing towards others, as in <a href="../../par/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a> (see Introduction, &sect; I.). <span class="cmt_word">Is come up before me,</span> and appeals for punishment, as <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20, 21</a>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, "The cry of its wickedness is come up unto me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; probably, <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>, a Phoenician city on the south coast of Spain, and therefore in the opposite direction to Nineveh. He was sent to the far east; he flees to the distant west. <span class="cmt_word">From the presence of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from the face of Jehovah.</span> This may mean, from God s special presence in Jerusalem or the Holy Land, as banishment from Cannaan is called "casting out of his sight" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>); or, from serving the Lord as his minister (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), Jonah preferring to renounce his office as prophet rather than execute his mission. The former seems the most natural explanation of the phrase. Kimchi says that Jonah supposed that the spirit of prophecy would not extend beyond the land of Israel. He could never have thought to escape from God's all-seeing eye. His repugnance to the duty imposed upon him arose partly from national prejudice, which made him loth to interfere in Gentile business, and partly, as he himself says (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), because he feared God's compassion would spare the Ninevites on their repentance, and that thus his prediction would be discredited, and mercy shown to heathens already inimical to Israel, if not known to him as the future conquerors of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Joppa.</span> This is the modern <span class="accented">Jaffa</span> (called Japho in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>), a town on the seacoast thirty miles in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem. "Jaffa," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 8, etc.), "is one of the oldest cities in the world. It was given to Dan in the distribution of the land by Joshua, and it has been known to history ever since. It owes its existence to the low ledge of rocks which extends into the sea from the extremity of the little cape on which the city stands, and forms a small harbour. Insignificant as it is, and insecure, yet, there being no other on all this coast, it was sufficient to cause a city to spring up around it even in the earliest times, and to sustain its life through numberless changes of dynasties, races, and religions, down to the present hour. It was, in fact, the only harbour of any notoriety possessed by the Jews throughout the greater part of their national existence. To it the timber for both the temples of Jerusalem was brought from Lebanon; and no doubt a lucrative trade in cedar and pine was always carried on through it with the nations who had possession of that goodly mountain. Through it, also, nearly all the foreign commerce of the Jews was conducted, until the artificial pert of Caessarea was built by Herod .... The harbour, howewer, is very inconvenient and insecure. Vessels of any considerable burden must lie out in the open road-stead - a very uneasy berth at all times; and even a moderate wind will oblige them to slip their cables and run out to sea, or seek anchorage at Haifa, sixty miles distant .... The road-stead is liable to sudden and unexpected storms, which stir up a tumultuous sea in a very short time .... The landing also is most inconvenient, and often extremely dangerous. More boats upset, and more lives are lost in the breakers at the north end of the ledge of rocks that defend the inner harbour than anywhere else on this coast." <span class="cmt_word">Went down into it</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "went up into it" (Septuagint).

Jonah had told them (ver. 10) that he was flying from God's service, but, knowing and earing nothing about Jehovah, they took him on board when he paid his fare, and thought nothing of his private reasons for joining them

Pusey quotes Josephus's account of the harbour of Joppa and the neighbouring sea, which, he says, is rendered very dangerous by the sudden rise of "the black north wind" ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:09. 3). Here we see wind and storm fulfilling God's word (<a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>).

Jonah hid himself there before the storm arose. The Hebrew word for "ship" (<span class="accented">sephinah</span>) is found nowhere else, and, probably from its derivation (<span class="accented">saphan</span>, "to cover"), implies that the vessel was decked. <span class="cmt_word">He lay, and was fast asleep;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>, "was asleep and snoring," (Septuagint); <span class="accented">dormiebat sopore gravi</span> (Vulgate).

He was fatigued and worn out with mental anxiety, and now being, as he thought, secure, and longing for solitude, he lay down to sleep, unconscious of danger. Contrast this sleep in the storm with that of Christ (<a href="../../par/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), and that of the apostles who slept for sorrow (<a href="../../par/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a>).

Jonah doubtless had meantime complied with the captain's request, but, as the sailors saw, without visible effect. The belief that temporal calamities are often connected with the presence of culprits, and are sent in judgment, is found in classical authors. Thus Plautus, 'Rudena,' 2:21 -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Pol minume miror, navis si fracta est tibi,<br />Scelus te et sceleste parta quae vexit bona."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Little I wonder if the ship is wrecked<br />Which carries thee and thy ill-gotten wealth."</span> (Comp.

Convinced that God had miraculously pointed him out as the culprit on whose account the storm was sent, and goaded by the stings of conscience, Jonah loses all his previous indecision and spiritual stupor, and in a manly and straightforward way confesses the truth without disguise. The LXX., reading differently, renders, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>, "A servant of Jehovah am I." This makes a tautological statement with the next words, and leaves one of the sailors' questions unanswered. <span class="cmt_word">I fear the Lord.</span> I worship, reverence (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Septuagint) Jehovah, who is not a local deity like the false gods whom you adore, but the Creator of heaven and earth, the Maker and Ruler of sea and dry land. So Abraham calls the Lord the God of heaven (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>), and Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37, 44</a>) uses the same expression (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>).

This is not a question of inquiry, for he had already told them that he had fled from the presence of the Lord; but rather an exclamation of horror and amazement at his folly and sin. That one who worshipped the Almighty Creator should disobey his command seemed to them outrageous and inexcusably criminal. The prophet does not spare himself in giving the history of the transaction. To be thus rebuked by heathen sailors must have added to the poignancy of his remorse. <span class="cmt_word">The presence of the Lord</span> (see note on ver. 3).

The sudden cessation of the storm showed that it had been sent on Jonah's account, and that the crew had not sinned by executing the sentence upon him. Usually it takes some time for the swell to cease after the wind has sunk: here there was suddenly a great calm (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-16.htm">Jonah 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feared the Lord.</span> They recognized the supernatural element in the transaction, and conceived an awe and fed, of Jehovah, who had wrought these wonders <span class="cmt_word">Offered a sacrifice unto the Lord.</span> Many commentators think that they sacrificed on reaching shore, as they had thrown the cargo overboard, and would have had no animal to offer.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

The fish was not created then and there, but God so ordered it that it should be at the place and should swallow Jonah. The prophet seems, from some expressions in his psalm (<a href="../../par/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a>), to have sunk to the bottom of the sea before he was swallowed by the fish. <span class="cmt_word">A great fish;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). There is nothing in the word to identify the intended animal, and to call it "a whale" is simply a mistranslation. The white shark of the Mediterranean (<span class="accented">Carcharias, vulgaris</span>), which sometimes measures twenty-five feet in length, has been known to swallow a man whole, and even a horse. This may have been the "great fish" in the text (see Dr. Pusey on Jonah, pp. 257, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the belly of the fish.</span> God used the natural agency of the fish, but the preservation of Jonah's life in the animal's belly is plainly supernatural. It is, indeed, analogous to the life of the child in its mother's womb; but it has besides a miraculous element which is unique, unless it was an actual death and revivification, as in the case of Lazarus. Also God ordained this  transaction as a type of the resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Three days and three nights;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew usage, parts of the days and nights; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one whole day, and parts of the day before and after this. Jonah was released on the third day (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a> with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; and <a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> with Esther 5:1). The historical nature of this occurrence is substantiated by Christ's reference to it as a figure of his own burial and resurrection. The antitype confirms the truth of the type. It is not credible that Christ would use a mere legendary tale, with no historical basis, to confirm his most solemn statement concerning the momentous fact of his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../obadiah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Obadiah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Obadiah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jonah/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jonah 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jonah 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
