They may have been in doubt as to whether they were to keep it in the wilderness, and indeed they do not seem to have attempted to keep it again until they reached the promised land (see on Joshua 5:5, 6). The passover had indeed been made an "ordinance for ever," but only when they were come to the land which the Lord should give them (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>). Apart, therefore, from express command, it would have been doubtful whether the feast should not at least he postponed. Inasmuch, however, as they had been detained at Sinai by Divine direction (albeit partly in consequence of their own idolatry, but for which they might already have been "at home"), it pleased God that they should not lack the blessing and support of the passover at its proper season. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At even.</span> See on Exodus 12:6. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the rites of it, and according</span> to all <span class="cmt_word">the ceremonies thereof.</span> This must be understood only of the essential rites and ceremonies of the passover, as mentioned below (verses 11, 12). It is singular that no mention is made of the considerable departure which circumstances necessitated from the original institution. It was not possible, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to strike the blood of the lamb upon the lintel and the side-posts of the doors, because in the wilderness they had no doors. In after ages this rite (which was of the essence of the institution) was represented by the sprinkling of the blood of the lambs on the altar (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), but no command is on record which expressly authorized the change. In <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-16</a> there is indeed a general direction, applying apparently to all domestic animals slain for food, that they be brought to the tabernacle to be slain, and that the priest sprinkle the blood upon the altar; and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-7</a> there is an order that in future times the passover was only to be slain at the place which the Lord should choose. The actual practice in later ages seems to have been founded partly upon the command in Deuteronomy, which restricted the killing <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the passover to Jerusalem (not, however, to the temple), and partly on the command in Leviticus, which really applied (at any rate in the letter) to the time of wandering only. As the celebration of the paschal feast had apparently been neglected from the time of Joshua until that of the later kings (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-21.htm">2 Kings 23:21-22</a>.), they were no doubt guided in the observance of it by the analogy of other sacrifices in the absence of express commands. It would, however, be an obvious source of error to assume that the practice of the age of Josiah or Hezekiah was the practice of the earliest passovers; so far as these necessarily differed from the original institution, it is absolutely uncertain <span class="cmt_word">how</span>  the difficulty was solved. Nothing perhaps better illustrates the mingled rigidity and elasticity of the Divine ordinances than the observance of the passover, in which so much of changed detail was united with so real and so unvarying a uniformity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-4.htm">Numbers 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they kept the passover.</span> It is a question which inevitably arises here, how they obtained a sufficient number of lambs for the requirement of so many people, and how they were slain sacrificially within the appointed time. The first difficulty does not seem serious when we consider, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that kids were available as well as lambs (see on Exodus 12:3); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the desert tribes would have abundance of lambs and kids for sale at this season, and that the Israelites certainly had money; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that in view of their speedy departure they would be disposed to kill off the young of their own flocks. The second difficulty is more serious, and would be insurmountable if we had to believe that the ritual of this passover was the same which afterwards prevailed. Josephus tells us ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3) that in his day 256,000 lambs were slain and their blood sprinkled upon the altar within the three hours "between the evenings." At that time, according to the same authority, a lamb was shared by ten, and often by as many as twenty people. The number of males who would partake of the paschal meal in the wilderness may be set down as not more than 800,000. If the women partook of it at all (which is very doubtful; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44, 48</a>), they would doubtless content themselves with the scraps left by the men. Allowing twenty souls to each lamb, the number required would be not more than 40,000. It is obvious at once that the three priests could not possibly kill 40,000 lambs in three hours, much less sprinkle their blood upon the altar; indeed the same may be said for 10,000, or even 5000, especially as they could not have acquired the extreme dexterity and dispatch which long practice taught to the later priests. Nor is it satisfactory to reply that the priests did the work "out of the hand of the Levites ' (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because this passover took place before the Levites were formally separated for the service of God and of the priests (see <a href="../../par/numbers/8-22.htm">Numbers 8:22</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the smallness of the space about the altar would not allow of many people assisting; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the actual slaying and sprinkling, which was restricted to the priests (being distinctively sacrificial in nature), are the very things which we find impossible in the time. There are but two alternative conclusions, from one or other of which there is no honest escape: either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the numbers of the people are greatly exaggerated, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the ritual of after days was not observed on this occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to (a), see what is said on the whole question of numbers in the Introduction. As to (b), it must be borne in mind that no direction whatever had been given, as far as we know, either that the lambs must be slain by the priests only, or that their blood must be poured upon the altar. If the Jews were left to follow the original institution as nearly as possible, they would have killed the lambs themselves, and sprinkled the blood around the doors of their tents. It is true that according to the Levitical ritual, now recently put into use, all other animals slain in sacrifice (or indeed for food) must be slain at the tabernacle by the priest, and the blood sprinkled on the altar; and it is true that this general rule was afterwards held especially binding in the case of the passover. But there is nothing to show that it was held binding then: the passover had been ordained before the establishment of the Levitical priesthood and law of sacrifice; and it might very well have been considered that it retained its primal character unaffected by subsequent legislation, and that the priesthood of the people (in other rites transferred to Aaron and his sons) was recalled and revived in the case of this special rite. If this was the case both at this passover and at that under Joshua, it is easy enough to understand why the later practice was so entirely different; the neglect or disuse of centuries obliterated the tradition of the passover, and when it was revived by the later kings, they naturally followed the analogy of all other sacrifices, and the apparently express command of <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-6</a>. They could not indeed obey this command in their daily life, but they could and did obey it in the striking and typical case of the paschal feast. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were certain men.</span> It has been supposed by many that these men must have been Mishael and Elizaphan, who had recently (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>) been defiled by burying their cousins Nadab and Abihu. This, however, is based upon the assumption that the totals given in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> and in <a href="../../par/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a> are really independent, and that therefore no one belonging to any other tribe than that of Levi had died in the interval. As that assumption is untenable (see above on chapter Numbers 1:46), so this "coincidence" falls to the ground. We know indeed that Mishael and Elizaphan were defiled at this time, and we do not know that any one else was; but, on the other hand, the words "the dead body of a man" seem to point to a single corpse only. <span class="cmt_word">Dead body.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-11.htm">Numbers 6:11</a>, and other places. It is inexplicable how this word, which properly means "soul," should have come to be used of a corpse; perhaps it is an additional testimony to the complete absence from Jewish teaching of  any doctrine of an immortal spirit. The Septuagint uses <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> here.

It was in the spirit of this command, though not in the letter of it, that Hezekiah acted (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>). And possibly it was in the spirit of this command that our Lord acted when he ate the passover by anticipation with his disciples twenty-four hours before the proper time - at which time he was himself to be the Lamb slain. <span class="cmt_word">With unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</span> These and the following directions are expressly added for fear lest any should think that the little passover might be celebrated with less solemnity and with less carefulness than the great passover.

But this was a clear departure from the original rule, for it was evidently intended that it should be in all respects a true passover, and in this case six clear days were allowed for the keeping of it (see on Numbers 10:11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">But the man that <i>is</i> clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">the man that is clean, and is not in a journey.</span> This threat was added no doubt in order to prevent men from taking advantage of the permission to keep a supplemental passover in order to suit their own convenience or interest.

It was rather the eating of the lamb that was insisted upon, as placing the partaker in communion with the God and Church of Israel, and so in a state of salvation. But after the law of sacrifices had been elaborated, then the paschal lamb, though prior to them all, naturally took its place amongst them as the greatest of them all, and as uniting in itself the special beauties of all.

The tent of the testimony was the holy of holies in which the ark dwelt (see on Numbers 10:11; 18:2). The exact meaning of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;</span> is disputed, or the rather significance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> with which the phrase "tent of the testimony" is appended to the word "tabernacle" (dwelling). Some take it as equivalent in construction to the genitive, "the dwelling of the tent of the testimony;" in which case it would simply mean that the cloud covered the whole tabernacle, the <span class="accented">mishcan</span> which enveloped and enclosed the <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which again enshrined the ark and the testimony.

Apart from the strict grammatical question, the comparison of other passages cited (especially <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>) seems in favour of the first interpretation, and so apparently the Septuagint and the Targums.
