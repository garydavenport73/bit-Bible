It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a>), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The "king of Arad, is mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>, and "the Negeb of Arad" in <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah. According to Eusebius, it stood twenty Roman miles to the south of Hebron, and its site has been found by modern travelers at Tel-Arad, a low hill in this direction. On the Negeb see note on Numbers 13:17. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the spies.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

The translation is very uncertain; <span class="accented">atharim</span> may be a proper name, as the Septuagint seems to suppose, or it may be an unusual  plural formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "spies," as the Chaldee, Samaritan, and most of the versions take it; or it may be simply the plural from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a place, used with some local meaning which made it practically a proper name. If the rendering of the A.V. be correct, "the way of the spies" must have been the route by which they ascended to Hebron through the Negeb (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17, 22</a>), and the king of Arid must have anticipated an invasion in that direction, and sought to forestall it. <span class="cmt_word">And took some of them prisoners.</span> This would seem to show that he fell upon them unawares, and cut off some detached parties. Nothing is said of any disobedience on the part of Israel to account for defeat in battle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel vowed a vow.</span> On these vows, and on things "devoted" or "banned" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), see on Leviticus 27:28, and on the moral character of such wholesale slaughters see on chapter 31. If it was right to destroy the Canaanites at all, no fault can be found with the vow; it merely did for that military proceeding what national feeling and discipline does for the far more bloody exigencies of modern warfare, removing it from the sphere of private hatred, revenge, and cupidity, and placing it upon a higher level. The patriot soldier of these days feels himself to be a mere instrument in the hands of the rulers of his people to maintain their rights or avenge their wrongs. The Israelite could not have this feeling, which was foreign to his time and place in history, but he could feel that he was a mere instrument in the hands of God to perform <span class="accented">his</span> will upon <span class="accented">his</span> enemies. In either case a must important advantage is secured; the soldier does not slay in order to gratify his own hatred, or in order to satisfy his own cupidity. It is quite true that such vows as are here mentioned would certainly in a more advanced stage of civilization be abused to throw a cloak of religion over frightful enormities; but it does not in the least follow that they were not permitted and even encouraged by God in an age to which they were natural, and under circumstances in which they were beneficial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They utterly destroyed them and their cities.</span> Rather, "they banned (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) them and their cities." No doubt the banning implies here their utter destruction, because it is not the vow before the battle, but the carrying of it out after the victory, which is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And he called the name of the place Hormah.</span> Rather, "the name of the place was called (impersonal use of the transitive) Charmah." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It is not very clear what place received this name at this time. It does not appear to have been Arid itself, as would have seemed most natural, because Arid and Hormah are mentioned side by side in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>. It is identified with Zephath in <a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>. It may have been the place where the victory was won which gave all the cities of Arid to destruction. Whether it was the Hormah mentioned in chapter Numbers 14:45 is very doubtful (see note there). The nomenclature of the Jews, especially as to places, and most especially as to places with which their own connection was passing or broken, was vague and confused in the extreme, and nothing can be more unsatisfactory than arguments which turn upon the shifting names of places long ago perished and forgotten. It must be added that the three verses which narrate the chastisement of this Canaanite chieftain have caused immense embarrassment to commentators. If the incident is narrated in its proper order of time, it must have happened during the stay of the Israelites under Mount Hor, when they had finally left the neighbourhood of the Negeb, and were separated from the king of Arid by many days' march, and by a most impracticable country. It is therefore generally supposed that the narrative is out of place, and that it really belongs to the time when Israel was gathered together for the second time at Kadesh, and When his reappearance there in force might well have given rise to the report that be was about to invade Canaan from that side. This is unsatisfactory, because no plausible reason can be assigned for the insertion of the notice where it stands, both here and in <a href="../../par/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>. To say that Moses wished to bring it into juxtaposition with the victories recorded in the latter part of the chapter, from which it is separated by the incident of the fiery serpents, and the brief record of many journeys, is to confess that no explanation can be invented which has the least show of reason. If the narrative be displaced, the displacement must simply be due to accident or interpolation. Again, it would seem quite inconsistent with the position and plans of Israel since the rebellion of Kadesh that any invasion and conquest, even temporary, of any part of Canaan should be made at this time, and that especially if the attack was not made until Israel was lying in the Arabah on his way round the land of Edom. It is therefore supposed by some that the vow only was made at this time, and the ban suspended over the place, and that it was only carried out as part of the general conquest under Joshua; that, in fact, the fulfillment of the vow is narrated in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16, 17</a>. This, however, throws the narrative as it stands into confusion and discredit, for the ban and the destruction become a mockery and an unreality if nothing more was done to  the towns of the king of Arad than was done at the same time to the towns of all his neighbours. It would be more reverent to reject the story as an error or a falsehood than to empty it of the meaning which it was obviously intended to convey. We are certainly meant to understand that the vow was there and then accepted by God, and was there and then carried into effect by Israel; the towns of Arad were depopulated and destroyed as far as lay in their power, although they may have been immediately reoccupied. There are only two theories which are worth considering. 1. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> really be displaced, for what cause we do not know. If so, it would <span class="accented">he</span> more satisfactory to refer it, not to the time of the second encampment at Kadesh, but to the time of the first, during the absence of the spies in Canaan. It is probable that their entry was known, as was the case with Joshua's spies (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>); and nothing could be more likely than that the king of Arad, suspecting what would follow, should attempt to anticipate invasion by attack. If it were so it might help to account for the rash confidence shown by the people afterwards (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40</a>), for the mention of Hormah (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and for the reappearance of kings of Hormah and of Arad in the days of <a href="../../par/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> after all be in place. That the Israelites lay for thirty days under Mount Hor is certain, and they may have been longer. During this period they could not get pasture for their cattle on the side of Edom, and they may have wandered far and wide in search of it. It may have been but a comparatively small band which approached the Negeb near enough to be attacked, and which, by the help of God, was enabled to defeat the king of Arad, and to lay waste his towns. It had certainly been no great feat for all Israel to overthrow a border chieftain who could not possibly have brought 5000 men into the field. CHAPTERS 21:4-9 THE FIERY SERPENTS (verses 4-9).

The word <span class="accented">saraph</span> which seems to mean "burning one," stands (by itself) for a serpent in verse 8, and also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 6</a> it stands for one of the symbolic beings (seraphim) of the prophet's vision. The only idea common to the two meanings (otherwise so distinct) must be that of brilliance and metallic luster. It is commonly assumed that the "fiery" serpents were so called because of the burning pain and inflammation caused by the bite, after the analogy of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of Dioscorus and AElian. But is hardly possible that Isaiah should have used the same word in such wholly dissimilar senses, and it is clear from comparison with Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>) that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> of <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> was so called from the burnished luster of his appearance. Even our Lord himself is described in the Apocalypse as having in the highest degree this appearance of glowing brass (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>). It is further clear that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> was so named from his colour, not his venom, because when Moses was ordered to make a <span class="accented">saraph</span> he made a serpent of brass (or rather copper), with the evident intent of imitating as closely as possible the appearance of the venomous  reptile. We may conclude then with some confidence that these serpents were of a fiery red colour, resembling in this respect certain very deadly snakes in Australia, which are known as "copper snakes." Travelers speak of some such pests as still abounding in the region of the Arabah, but it is quite uncertain whether the fiery serpents of that special visitation can be identified with any existing species.

In the list of chapter 33, there occur two other stations, Zahnonah and Phunon, between Mount Hor and Oboth. Phunon may be the Pinou of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-41.htm">Genesis 36:41</a>, but it is a mere conjecture. All we can conclude with any certainty is that the Israelites passed round the southern end of the mountains of Edom by the Wady el Ithm, and then marched northwards along the eastern border of Edom by the route now followed between Mekba and Damascus. On this side the mountains are far less precipitous and defensible than on  the other, and this circumstance must have abated the insolence of the Edomites. Moreover, they must now have seen enough of Israel to know that, while immensely formidable in number and discipline, he had no hostile designs against them. It is therefore not surprising to find from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a> that on this side the mountaineers supplied Israel with bread and water, just as they supply the pilgrim caravans at the present day. That they exacted payment for what they supplied was perfectly reasonable: no one could expect a poor people to feed a nation of two million souls, however nearly related, for nothing. Oboth has been identified with the modern halting-place of el-Ahsa, on the pilgrim route above mentioned, on the ground of supposed similarity in the meaning of the names; but the true rendering of Oboth is doubtful (see on Leviticus 19:31), and, apart from that, any such similarity of meaning is too vague and slight a ground for any argument to be built upon.

It was apparently applied to the whole of Peraea in later times (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20</a>, "passages"), but in the Pentateuch is confined elsewhere to the ranges facing Jericho. These "ruinous heaps of the ranges" lay to the east of Moab, along the desert side of which Israel was now marching, still going northwards: they cannot-be identified.

It must have been in the upper part of its course, in the desert uplands, that the Israelites crossed it; and this both because the passage lower down is extremely difficult, and also because they were keeping well to the eastward of Moabitish territory up to this point. It is not certain which side of the stream is intended by "the other side," because the force of these expressions depends as often upon the point of view of the writer as of the reader. It would appear from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a> that Israel remained at this spot until the embassage to Sihon had returned. <span class="cmt_word">That cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Aruon, or perhaps one of its confluents which comes down from the northeast. <span class="cmt_word">For Arnon is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the border of</span> Moab.

If it should seem strange that a book of this description should be already in existence, we must remember that amongst the multitude of Israel there must in the nature of things have been some "poets" in the then acceptation of the word. Some songs there must have been, and those songs would be mainly inspired by the excitement and triumph of the final marches. The first flush of a new national life achieving its first victories over the national foe always finds expression in songs and odes. It is abundantly evident from the foregoing narrative that writing of some sort was in common use at least among the leaders of Israel (see on Numbers 11:26), and they would not have thought it beneath them to collect these spontaneous effusions of a nation just awaking to the poetry of its own existence. The archaic character of the fragments preserved in this chapter, which makes them sound so foreign to our ears, is a strong testimony to their genuineness. It is hardly credible that any one of a later generation should have cared either to compose or to quote snatches of song which, like dried flowers, have lost everything but scientific value in being detached from the soil which gave them birth. <span class="cmt_word">What he did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon.</span> Rather, "Vaheb in whirlwind, and the brooks of Arnon."

The peculiarity of the site, "in the midst of the river" (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), and extensive ruins, have enabled travelers to identify the spot on which it stood at the junction of the Mojeb (Arnon) and Lejum (Nahaliel, verse 19). It is uncertain whether the Greeks gave the name of Areopolis, as Jerome asserts, to Ar,  but in later times it was Rabbah, a town many miles further south in the heart of Moab which bore this name. Ar was at this period the boundary town of Moab, and as such was respected by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9, 29</a>).

The original runs simply thus: "And from Bamoth - the valley which in the field - Moab - the top - Pisgah." It may therefore be read, "And from the heights to the valley that is in the field of Moab, viz., the top of Pisgah." The "field" of Moab (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>) was no doubt the open, treeless expanse north of Arnon, drained by the Wady Waleh, which had formerly belonged to Moab. Pisgah ("the ridge") was a part of the Abarim ranges west of Heshbon, from the summit of which the first view is gained of the valley of Jordan and the hills of Palestine (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which looketh toward Jeshimon.</span> Jeshimon, or "the waste," seems to mean here that desert plain on the north-east side of the Salt Sea now called the Ghor el Belka, which included in its barren desolation the southernmost portion of the Jordan valley.

The list of stations in the preceding verses may probably have been copied out of some official record; it may be considered as marking the movements of the tabernacle with Eleazar and the Levites and the mass of the non-combatant population. In the mean time the armies of Israel were engaged in victorious enterprises which took them far afield. <span class="cmt_word">King of the Amorites.</span> The Amorites were not akin to the Hebrews, as the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites were, who all claimed descent from Terah. They were of the Canaanitish stock (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>), and indeed the name Amorite often appears as synonymous with Canaanite in its larger sense (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 27</a>, &c.). If at one time they are mentioned side by side with five or six other tribes of the same stock (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11</a>), yet at another they seem to be so much the representative race that "the Ammorite" stands for the inhabitants of Canaan in general whom Israel was commissioned to oust on account of his iniquity (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). It is not, therefore, possible to draw any certain distinction between the Amorites of Sihon's kingdom and the mass of the Canaanites on the other side Jordan. Both Sihon and his people appear as intruders in this region, having come down perhaps from the northern parts of Palestine, and having but recently (it would seem) wrested from the king of Moab all his territory north of Arnon. It was the fact of the Amorites being found here which led to the conquest and settlement of the trans-Jordanic territory. That territory was not apparently included in the original gift (compare <a href="../../par/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a> with <a href="../../par/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and Genesis 15:19-21), but since the Amorite had possessed himself of it, it must pass with all the rest of his habitation to the chosen people.

It was, therefore, a critical moment in their history when they met the forces of Sihon, confident from their recent victory over Moab. We may suppose that Joshua was their military leader now, as before and after. From Arnon unto Jabbok. The Jabbok, which formed the boundary of Sihon on the north towards the kingdom of Og, and on the east towards the Ammonites, is the modern Zerka: it runs in a large curve northeast, north-west, and west, until it fails into Jordan, forty-five miles north of the mouth of the Arnon. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> This is perhaps intended to explain rather why the Amorites had not extended their conquests any further, than why the Israelites made no attempt to cross the border of Ammon; they had another and more sufficient reason (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Rabbah of Ammon, which stood upon the right (here the eastern) bank of the Upper Jabbok, was an extremely strong place which effectually protected the country behind it, even until the reign of David (see on 2 Samuel 11, 12).

A class of persons well marked among the Hebrews, as perhaps in all ancient countries.

It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5e9;</span>, to subdue, and thus will have substantially the same meaning as Milcom, Molech, and Baal; indeed it appears probable that there was a strong family likeness among the idolatries of Palestine, and that the various names represented different attributes of one supreme being rather than different divinities. Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (<a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>) in form, and either male or female (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> in <a href="../../par/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god "Ashtar-Chemosh" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side.

The Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;</span>) and the Samaritan evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and this has been generally followed: "we have wasted even unto Nophah, - with fire unto Medeba." Medeba, of which the ruins are still known by the same name, lay five or six miles south-south-east of Heshbon. It was a fortress in the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>) and of Omri, as appears from the Moabite stone.

It may have been only the detachment which had reconnoitered and taken Jaazer, and they may have found themselves threatened by the forces of Og, and so led on to further conquests beyond the Jabbok. Og <span class="cmt_word">the</span> king of Bashan. Og was himself of the aboriginal giant race which had left so many remnants, or at least so many memories, in these regions (see on Deuteronomy 2:10-12, 20-23; Joshua 12:4; 13:12); but he is classed with Sihon as a king of the Amorites (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>) because his people were chiefly at least of that race. Bashan itself comprised the plain now known as Jaulan and Haulan beyond the Jarmuk (now Mandhur), the largest affluent of the Jordan, which joins it a few miles below the lake of Tiberias. The kingdom of Og, however, extended over the northern and larger part of Gilead, a much more fertile territory than Bashan proper (see on Deuteronomy 3:1-17). <span class="cmt_word">At Edrei.</span> Probably the modern Edhra'ah, or Der'a, situate on a branch of the Jarmuk, some twenty-four miles from Bozrah. The ancient city lies buried beneath the modern village, and was built, like the other cities of Bashan, in the most massive style of architecture. The cities of Og were so strong that the Israelites could not have dispossessed him by any might of their own if he had abode behind his walls. Either confidence in his warlike prowess or some more mysterious cause (see on Joshua 24:12) impelled him to leave his fortifications, and give battle to the Israelites to his own utter defeat.

In this sultry depression, below the level of the sea, there are tracts of fertile and well-watered land amidst prevailing barrenness (see on Numbers 33:49). <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan by Jericho.</span> Rather, "beyond the Jordan of Jericho," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>. On the phrase, "beyond the Jordan" ("Peraea"), which is used indifferently of both sides, the one by a conventional, the other by a natural, use, see on Deuteronomy 1:1. The Jordan of Jericho is the river in that part of its course where it flows past the district of Jericho. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 20"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 22"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
