In either case it is an epithet applied to the judges of the people, and not to the congregation. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</span> Both questions are asked in bitter irony, as is clear from the context.

What the psalmist means is that those who ultimately become heinous sinners, for the most part show, even from their early childhood, a strong tendency towards evil. He implies that with others the case is different. Though there may be in them a corruption of nature (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), yet, on the whole, they have good dispositions, and present a contrast to the ungodly ones whom he is describing.

They are <span class="cmt_word">like the deaf adder</span> that <span class="cmt_word">stoppeth her ear.</span> The "adder" was supposed to be deaf, on account of its being very difficult to charm. It was thought obstinately to set itself against the charmer, and, as it were, stop its ears against him.

Metaphors are accumulated. Menace follow menace. The wrath of God is first invoked upon the evil doers (vers. 6-8); then (ver. 9) coming judgment is announced. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth.</span> Serpent charmers sometimes, when they have caught their snake, proceed to beat out the poison fangs with a stone or stick (Geike, 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1, p. 245). The psalmist, in the first clause, seems to allude to this practice; in the second, he changes the metaphor, reverting to his favourite image of the young lion (<span class="accented">kephir</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord.</span> The "cheek teeth" (<a href="../../par/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>), or principal fangs on either side, are intended.

Snails in Palestine, during dry seasons, often shrink, shrivel up, and disappear from their shells (Tristram, 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 296). Like <span class="cmt_word">the untimely birth of a woman,</span> that <span class="cmt_word">they may not see the sun;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that hath not seen the sun</span> (Professor Cheyne, Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let them be as an abortion" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a></div><div class="verse">Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <i>his</i> wrath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</span> This "difficult and obscure verse" has been variously explained. Professor Cheyne translates, "Before your pots can feel the thorns, and while your flesh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flesh in the pots, on which you are about to feast) is still raw, the hot wrath of Jehovah shall sweep it away." The Revised Version gives the following: "Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thorns] away with a whirlwind, the green [thorns] and the burning alike." Dr. Kay, "Before your caldrons have felt the thorn fire, even as raw flesh, even so, shall hot fury sweep him away." The general meaning seems to be that before the wicked judges can enjoy the fruits of their wickedness, the fierce wrath of God will come upon them like a tempest, and sweep both them and the produce of their villainy away (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6, 7</a>).

Dante says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"O Signor mio, quando saro io lieto<br />A veder la vendetta, che nascosa<br />Fa dolce l'ira tua nel suo segreto?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Purg.,' 20:94-96.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>). It is observable that David, personally, was too indulgent, rather than too severe, towards offenders.
