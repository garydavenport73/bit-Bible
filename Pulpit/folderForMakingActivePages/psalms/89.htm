They strike the keynote, which is, first, praise of God's faithfulness generally (vers. 1, 2), and secondly, praise of him in respect of the Davidical covenant (vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.</span> "Forever" is the emphatic  phrase. The psalmist will commemorate God's mercies, not only when they are continuing, but always. <span class="cmt_word">With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to generation and generation.</span>

God's promise to David is the entire foundation of the psalmist's hope and confidence. He therefore places it briefly in the very forefront - afterwards expanding it into the beautiful passage, which forms more than one-third of the entire composition (vers. 19-37). <span class="cmt_word">I have sworn unto David my servant</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>).

After Zerubbabel, no prince of the Davidic house sat on the throne of David, or had temporal sway over Israel. The descendants of David sank into obscurity, and so remained for five centuries. Still, however, God's faithfulness was sure. In Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, the true King of the <span class="accented">everlasting</span> kingdom was raised up - every pledge made to David was fulfilled. "Messiah the Prince," eternal King of an eternal kingdom, appeared as the true "Seed' intended, and began his spiritual reign over the spiritual Israel, which still continues, and will continue forever.

His song of praise divides into two portions. From ver. 5 to ver. 18 it is a general laudation of the Almighty for his greatness in heaven (vers. 5-7), in nature (vers. 9, 11, 12), and in the course of his rule on earth (vers. 10, 13-18), after which it passes into a laudation of him in respect of what he had done, and what he had promised, to David (vers. 19-37). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord.</span> "The heavens" here are not the material heavens, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. l, but the company of the dwellers in heaven. God's praise fittingly begins with them. <span class="cmt_word">Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</span> The "congregation of the saints" is the company of angels (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>). Not on earth only (vers. 1, 2), but in heaven also God's "faithfulness" is the theme of song.

Or to thy faithfulness round about thee! rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and thy faithfulness is round about thee.</span> It has been said that "the two words 'mercies' and 'faithfulness' are the refrain of the psalm." The latter occurs six times (vers. 1, 2, 5, 8, 24, 33), and "faithful" in ver. 37.
