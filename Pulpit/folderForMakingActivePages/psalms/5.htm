The Oriental habit of making requests in loud and shrill tones is the origin of these forms of speech. My King.

The appointment of daily morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>) pointed out morn and eve as times especially appropriate for prayer. A natural instinct suggested the same idea (<a href="../../par/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee. The repetition adds force to the implied injunction (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>). The word translated "direct my prayer" means "arrange" or "set in order," as the priests did the altar before a sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7, 8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>).

It was by God's mercy that David lived, that he was maintained in health and strength, that he had a desire to go to God's house, and was permitted to worship there. Of all these mercies he is deeply sensible. <span class="cmt_word">And in thy fear will I worship</span>. David's worship is never without fear - a reverent sense of God's greatness, power, and perfect holiness. <span class="cmt_word">Toward thy holy temple</span>. "David would, according to the custom of the worship then established, turn himself in the time of prayer to the place where the gracious presence of the Lord had its seat" (Hengstenberg; scrap. <a href="../../par/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/138-7.htm">Psalm 138:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30, 33, 38, 42, 44, 48</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>).

It is that God will lead him in the path of his righteousness - that righteousness of which he is the pattern, and whereof he approves; and will "make his way plain for him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> show it him clearly, so that he cannot mistake it. God is asked to do this, especially because of David's enemies, or of "those that lie in wait for him" (Revised Version margin), lest, if he were to make a false step, they should triumph over him, and so he should bring discredit upon the cause of God and of his saints<span class="cmt_word">. Make thy way straight</span> (<span class="accented">plain</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">before my face</span>.

"Emitting the noisome exhalations of a putrid heart" (Bishop Horns). <span class="cmt_word">They flatter with their tongue</span>; literally, they make <span class="accented">smooth their tongues</span>, which may, perhaps, include flattery, but points rather to smooth arguments, specious reasonings, and the habit of making the worse appear the better cause (see the comment of Bishop Horsley, 'Book of Psalms,' vol. 1. pp. 154, 155). The last two clauses of this verse are quoted by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>), and applied generally to the character of the ungodly.

David assumes that God will make his enemies fall; he prays that they may fall from the effect of their own counsels. The fate of Ahithophel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>) perhaps fulfilled this imprecation<span class="cmt_word">.

David is fond of contrasts. Here he sots the lot of the righteous over against that of the wicked. While the wicked "fall," and are "cast out," or "thrust down' to hell, the righteous "rejoice " - nay, ever shout for joy, displaying their feelings in the true Oriental manner. <span class="cmt_word">Because thou defendest them</span>. There is no "because" in the original.
