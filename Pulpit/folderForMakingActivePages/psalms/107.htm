Such sudden changes do sometimes occur, not only in inland seas, but on the Mediterranean (see <a href="../../par/jonah/1-15.htm">Jonah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that the waves thereof are still</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the waves of them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of the great waters (see ver. 23). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-30.htm">Psalm 107:30</a></div><div class="verse">Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then are they glad because they be quiet</span>; or, "because they be at rest," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no longer tempest-tossed. <span class="cmt_word">So he bringeth them unto their desired haven</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the haven of their desire</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the haven where they desire to be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-31.htm">Psalm 107:31</a></div><div class="verse">Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that men</span>, etc. Repeated from vers. 8, 15, and 21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-32.htm">Psalm 107:32</a></div><div class="verse">Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people</span>. The psalmist holds it to be not enough for men who have received deliverances to thank God in their hearts, or secretly in their chambers. He requires them to make public profession of their thankfulness "in the congregation of the people." The Christian Church maintains the same attitude. <span class="cmt_word">And praise him in the assembly of the elders</span>. The elders led the congregation and presided in it (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-9.htm">Ezra 3:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-4.htm">Nehemiah 9:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a></div><div class="verse">He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-42.</span> - Professor Cheyne finds in this passage - which he views as an "appendix" to the psalm - a falling off from the earlier portion of the psalm, and a set of "sentences strung together without much reflection." But to others the transition from special deliverances to God's general dealings with mankind seems an enlargement and an advance in the thought, although the language may be less graphic and more commonplace than in the former portion of the composition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turneth rivers into a wilderness</span>. God can, and does, by the operation of his providence, turn lands naturally fertile - lands abounding with streams - into arid wastes, either by such a physical catastrophe as that which blasted the cities of the plain (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24, 25</a>), or by such moral changes as have turned Babylonia from a garden into a desert, a miserable howling wilderness  (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15-22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13-15, 38-40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13, 37-43</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And the water springs into dry ground</span>. The phrase is varied, but the meaning is the same. God has full control over nature, and can either take back his blessings, or render them of no avail. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a></div><div class="verse">A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fruitful land into barrenness</span>; literally, into <span class="accented">saltness</span>. The judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah is probably in the writer's mind. <span class="cmt_word">For the wickedness of them that dwell therein</span>. God does not capriciously withdraw his blessings from a land. If he turns a fruitful land into a barren one, we may be sure that the inhabitants have provoked him by their sins. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a></div><div class="verse">He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turneth the wilderness into a standing water</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a wilderness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And dry ground into water springs</span>. The entire verse is antithetical to ver. 33. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a></div><div class="verse">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell</span>. God gives the laud, which he has thus blessed, to some previously famishing people; as he did Canaan to Israel after they had had but scant fare in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">That they may prepare a city for habitation</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and they prepare</span>. It is naturally their first thought to prepare themselves a settled dwelling-place (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-37.htm">Psalm 107:37</a></div><div class="verse">And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And sow the fields; literally, and sow fields</span> - the first act of a settled population. <span class="cmt_word">And plant vineyards</span>. The second act in a wine-producing country. Bread and wine were recognized in the East as the prime necessaries of life (see <a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-19.htm">Judges 19:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Which may yield fruits of increase</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and get them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">make them</span>. The expression, "fruits of increase," points to the abundance of the harvest and vintage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-38.htm">Psalm 107:38</a></div><div class="verse">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly</span>. With in creasing prosperity comes increase of population, naturally - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by God's ordinary providence. This increase is, however, only a blessing within certain limits. <span class="cmt_word">And suffereth not their cattle to decrease</span>. This modest under-statement suggests an enormous increase (comp. <a href="../../par/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39</a></div><div class="verse">Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again</span>. There is no "again" in the original, but merely the usual yaw conjunctive. Still, in the <span class="accented">thought</span>, there is no doubt an abrupt transition. The writer turns to the darker side of the picture. <span class="cmt_word">They are minished and brought low</span>. God shows his providence, not merely in blessing, but also in chastising. Even the very nation which has been the most highly favored may, by misconduct, fall under his displeasure and suffer at his hands. Their population is diminished; they arc "bowed down" (Revised Version), or "brought low." Calamities of various kinds befall them. Sometimes their decline is brought about <span class="cmt_word">through oppression</span>, which may be either the cruel rule of a native monarch, such as Saul, or the still heavier yoke of a foreign power, like Egypt or Babylon. Sometimes it comes from such an <span class="cmt_word">affliction</span> as bad harvests, plagues of locusts, or pestilence. Sometimes it is brought about by <span class="cmt_word">sorrow</span> - the death of a good ruler in the flower of his age, the extinction of a royal stock, the destruction of a nation's best and bravest on battle-fields, and the like. But in all calamities alike it is God's hand that deals the blow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a></div><div class="verse">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <i>where there is</i> no way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He poureth contempt upon princes</span>. A direct quotation from <a href="../../par/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>, but not therefore to be regarded as spurious, since the sacred writers often quote one another, and the psalmists especially are very much in the habit of citing, or referring to Job (see, in this very psalm, besides the present passage, vers. 10, 18 (<span class="accented">bis</span>), 20, 34, 41, and 42). <span class="cmt_word">And causeth them to wander in the wilderness</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>). Where there is <span class="cmt_word">no way</span>. "Wandering in a wilder ness without a way denotes helpless embarrassment" (Hengstenberg). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/107-41.htm">Psalm 107:41</a></div><div class="verse">Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <i>him</i> families like a flock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction</span>. Even in such dread calamities, when a whole nation is punished, God's providence protects the poor and needy - not of course in all, but still in very many, cases. The mower's scythe passes over the humblest flowers. <span class="cmt_word">And maketh him families like a flock</span> (setup. <a href="../../par/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>). Those whom God thus preserves he collects into "families," and looks after as carefully as a shepherd looks after his sheep.

Experience will justify God's ways to man. "The righteous" - his people - will see that the general course of God's providence is such as described (vers. 33  - 41), and will "rejoice" that it is so. <span class="cmt_word">And all iniquity shall stop her mouth</span>. The gain sayers, unable to impugn the righteousness of the Divine proceedings, shall have no resource but to sit still and hold their tongues.
