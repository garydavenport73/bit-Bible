"It can scarcely be doubted," as Dean Johnson well observes, "that the words of ver. 47 refer to deliverance from the Babylonish captivity," which was the only one that involved the dispersion of the whole people, and the suspension of the liturgical offering of thanks and praise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save us, O Lord our God.</span> Contrast with this the "remember me" of ver. 4. The review of the national history has quickened  the psalmist's sympathies and widened them. Previously he prayed only for himself. Now it will not content him unless the people generally are "saved." <span class="cmt_word">And gather us from among the heathen.</span> (On the wide dispersion of the Israelites at the time of the Babylonian captivity, see the comment on ver. 27.) <span class="cmt_word">To give thanks unto thy holy Name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span> This is spoken of as the consequence of the gathering together. Dispersion could not, of course, prevent the rendering of praise and thanks by individual Israelites (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>); but it had stopped the united liturgical expression of them. On the restoration of the Israelites to their own land, this was resumed (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2-11</a>).
