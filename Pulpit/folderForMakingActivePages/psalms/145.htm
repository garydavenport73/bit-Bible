The handing down of God's mercies and deliverances from age to age is always regarded in Scripture as the principal mode whereby they are kept in remembrance (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8-10, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3-7</a>, etc.).

It was the duty of every faithful Israelite to set forth God's majesty, and to "declare his works with rejoicing" (<a href="../../par/psalms/117-2.htm">Psalm 117:2</a>). David proclaims himself ready to perform this duty. Then, he thinks, others will join in.

Professor Cheyne compares the epithets in a Babylonian hymn to the sun-god; but a closer parallel is to be found in <a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>, "The Lord God is merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin" (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>).

He "wouldeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live," And his "tender mercies," or "compassions," are not only over his human creatures, but" over all his works" - all that he has made - animals as well as men, "creeping things," zoophytes, all that can feel.

The "glory" of God's kingdom is such that the faithful are naturally drawn to "speak" of it. "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth throughout all ages" (ver. 13). "His kingdom <span class="accented">ruleth over all"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>) - heaven and earth, and hell, and all space, and whatever space contains.

"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And talk of thy power</span>. "Power" is of the essence of kingship, and comes naturally to the front whenever the character of a kingdom is spoken of.

Much less can any other, and necessarily inferior, power overthrow it. <span class="cmt_word">And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</span> This is rather an anti-climax, since the generations of men will one day cease; but it was a customary phrase (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-17.htm">Psalm 45:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-6.htm">Psalm 61:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>, etc.), and brought home to men the thought that his special "dominion" was over <span class="accented">them</span>.
