According to Aristotle, we have a special emotion implanted in our nature - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - which causes us to "fret" when we witness undeserved prosperity ('Rhet.,' 2:9, &sect; 1). Certainly the feeling is very common and very strong; it is also characteristic of the best natures (see <a href="../../par/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>). The feeling does not need to be eradicated, but only to be held in check. Faith in God's retributive justice will enable us calmly to await "the end" (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>), in full assurance that ultimately God's vengeance will overtake the wicked man, and he will receive condign punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity</span>. Envy is not a natural passion. To envy the evil-doers on account of their prosperity is at once a folly and a danger. Their position is really not enviable; and, if we allow ourselves to envy them, we shall be tempted to follow their example (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>).

So Zophar, in the Book of Job (<a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>), "The triumphing of the wicked is <span class="accented">short</span>, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment." And, no doubt, if we compare time with eternity, the longest triumph that the wicked ever enjoy is but for a brief space, is soon gone, endures "but for a moment." It has a continuance, however, which to men in this life seems long, often intolerably long; and hence the disturbance which men's minds suffer on account of it (<a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-16</a>).

The meaning is, "Cast thyself and thy life unreservedly upon God - yield thyself wholly to him - look to him for support and guidance." <span class="cmt_word">Trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass</span>. "He will accomplish all that thy faith has laid upon him" (Kay).

It is when the ungodly <span class="accented">prosper</span> that the righteous are apt to repine. Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. It is the success of the ungodly in their wicked plots and schemes which especially vexes the righteous (see <a href="../../par/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-9</a>: 24:2-12; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5-12</a>, etc.).

If men will dwell unduly on the fact of the prosperity of the wicked, and brood upon it in their hearts, they will be apt, in the first instance, to envy the wicked, which is at once "to do evil;" and from this they will be naturally tempted to go on to an imitation of their wicked practices, which is to assimilate themselves altogether to the enemies of God, and to be guilty of practical apostasy (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>, "But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh supped.

It is foolish to "fret" and rage and storm against the ungodly whom we see prospering, since they will certainly be "cut <span class="accented">off"</span> sooner or later - sooner rather than later, according to the belief of the writer (see vers. 2, 10). But those that wait upon the Lord (see Ver. 7), they shall inherit the earth. It is doubly foolish, since when the wicked are "cut off," as they will be assuredly some day, the godly will find themselves the inheritors of the earth. This prophecy is partially fulfilled from time to time, and will find its complete fulfilment in the "new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>).

The mere continuance of a man's posterity in a prosperous condition cannot exhaust the meaning of such phrases as, "Their inheritance shall be for ever;" "Dwell for evermore;" "The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever."

The good man may be afflicted; he may even fall into some fault (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>) or grievous sin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4</a>); but so long as "the root of the matter is in him" (<a href="../../par/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>), God will not suffer him to be prostrated. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Lord supports his hand.</span> If he falls, God (as Luther says) "catches him by the hand, and raises him up again."

It has certainly all the gravity, calmness, seriousness, and tone of authority which befit a teacher of many years and much experience. <span class="cmt_word">Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread</span>. The social condition of the Israelites was very unlike that of modern European communities. Though there were rich and poor among them, there could scarcely be any that were <span class="accented">very</span> poor. Where there was a general obligation upon all well-disposed persons to lend to such as were in need, and no interest could be asked upon loans, and in the year of jubilee all debts were remitted, and mortgaged lands returned to their original owners or their families, actual begging was scarcely possible, and at any rate could only be brought about by extreme and reckless misconduct. Many philanthropists believe that even at the present time in our own country mendicancy is nearly always the consequence of persistence in evil courses. Still more must this have been the case in Palestine in the time of the monarchy (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>).

This psalm contains a good deal of repetition, perhaps intended to emphasize certain portions of its teaching (see vers. 1, 7, 8; 3, 27; 11, 22, 29; 7, 34, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And his seed is blessed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/25-13.htm">Psalm 25:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/102-28.htm">Psalm 102:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>).

Wicked men hate righteous men, as being a reproach to them, and also as being a hindrance and a danger. The righteous thwart their plans, oppose their proceedings, often frustrate their counsels. Sometimes their opposition brings the wicked man into peril, as when it takes the shape of prosecution before a court, or of help given to one who has fallen among thieves. Hence the hatred felt by the wicked towards the righteous is not surprising. It leads the wicked to entertain murderous thoughts - to be ever "watching" for an opportunity when he may take the righteous man at a disadvantage, and, if no other means of removing him from his path present themselves, kill him. Modern civilization, with its precautions and "resources," prevents actual violence for the most part; but the tour-derous instinct remains, and even now, in his heart, many a wicked man is a murderer.

And keep his way.</span> The way in which he would have them walk - the way of righteousness (comp. ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall exalt thee to inherit the land</span> (see ver. 29, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>When the ungodly are cut off, thou shalt see it</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a><span class="cmt_word">:</span>8). Doubtless with some satisfaction. As the "ungodly" spoken of are employed in watching for an occasion to "slay" the righteous (ver. 32), these last can scarcely witness their removal from the world by God's providence without a feeling of relief.

The sudden disappearance of an imposing personality astonishes and confuses us. We cannot believe that one who has played so prominent a part in our drama of life is gone altogether. We look about for him; we expect him to reappear at any moment. We cannot realize the fact that he is vanished for ever. We ask ourselves, "Where is he?' (<a href="../../par/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>).

This translation is much disputed. Most ancients and many moderns render the first line, "Keep innocency, and observe uprightness," while some critics maintain that <span class="accented">acharith</span> in the second line must mean "posterity," and not "end." Others, again, join <span class="accented">shalom</span> to <span class="accented">ish</span>, and render, "There shall be posterity (or, a future) to the man of peace." However, the rendering of the Authorized Version is retained by our Revisers, and accepted in part by Hengstenberg and Dr. Kay, while it has the complete approval of Canon Cook.

The last two verses sum up the teaching of the psalm, and indicate its especial object, which was to encourage and sustain the righteous under their trials, by the assurance that they were under the special protection of God, who, whenever trouble threatened, would stand forth as their Strength and Defence, and would ultimately be their "Salvation." The full meaning of this last expression was left obscure, though enough was said to raise the hope that this world was not the end of everything, but rather the beginning.
