Poverty in the ordinary sense is scarcely intended.

He is not only man's Creator, but his "Preserver" (<a href="../../par/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For I am holy.</span> The psalmist does not mean to claim for himself perfect holiness, but only that sincerity in religion which God's servants may rightly vindicate to themselves. <span class="cmt_word">O thou my</span> <span class="cmt_word">God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee</span> (comp, <a href="../../par/psalms/34-22.htm">Psalm 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/37-40.htm">Psalm 37:40</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-4.htm">Psalm 86:4</a></div><div class="verse">Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice the soul of thy servant.</span> The prayer rises from mere entreaties for relief and recovery from a state of suffering, into an earnest request for that which the heart of man is ever longing for and seeking after - gladness and joy. The faithful are promised that they shall come ultimately to a condition of exceeding great joy; but even saints are sometimes impatient, and want their joy in this world and at once. <span class="cmt_word">For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a>, entitled, like this, "a Psalm of David"). There is no more likely way of attaining to spiritual joy than to be always lifting up the soul to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a></div><div class="verse">For thou, Lord, <i>art</i> good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</span> The word translated "ready to forgive," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>, occurs here only; but the context sufficiently fixes its meaning, which is well expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> of the LXX. As God was "good" and "forgiving," he would be likely to grant the petitions just addressed to him. And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-6.htm">Psalm 86:6</a></div><div class="verse">Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - In this second strophe praise is predominant. Prayer occupies two verses only (vers. 6, 7); in the other three (vers. 8-10) God is magnified and glorified. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer.</span> An echo of ver. 1. The psalmist begins, as it were, afresh, calling God's attention to himself, as if he had not yet spoken. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">attend to the voice of my supplications</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>, etc.). That God's ear is always attent to the prayers of  his people does not make it superfluous for them to entreat his attention. He will listen more favourably when besought to listen.

The nature of the trouble is not distinctly stated; but it appears to have been caused by domestic rather than foreign enemies. <span class="cmt_word">For thou wilt answer me</span> (comp. ver. 5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a></div><div class="verse">Among the gods <i>there is</i> none like unto thee, O Lord; neither <i>are there any works</i> like unto thy works.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord</span> (see the Song of Moses, <a href="../../par/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>). The imaginary gods of the heathen - not, perhaps, known to the psalmist to be wholly imaginary - are probably meant (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither are there any works like unto thy works.</span> So in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>, "What god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a></div><div class="verse">All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/82-8.htm">Psalm 82:8</a>, etc.). Since God had made all nations (<a href="../../par/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>), it was safe to conclude that they would all one day worship him. The prophecy, however, still remains unfulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">And shall glorify thy Name.</span> Either with their lips, or in their lives, or in both ways. Compare the anticipations of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>), Zephaniah (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>), and Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9, 16</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a></div><div class="verse">Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-17.</span> - The third strophe is almost equally divided between prayer and praise, vers. 11, 16, and 17 being devoted to the one; and vers. 12, 13, and 15 to the other. Ver. 14 is of the nature of a complaint. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>). Man cannot know "the way of the Lord," unless he is taught of God. The inward anointing of the Spirit is needful to teach us what God would really have us do (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>). It is only when we are thus taught that we can "walk in his truth." <span class="cmt_word">Unite my heart to fear thy Name.</span> So Symmachus, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Canon Cook, Dr. Kay, Hupfeld, Professor Alexander, and the Revised Version. Hengstenberg prefers "incline my heart;" and Professor Cheyne would alter the text into accordance with the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Make my heart to rejoice." But the textual reading has the weight of authority in its favour, and gives an excellent sense, "Bring all my heart into unison, that it may be wholly fixed on thee." Compare the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-12.htm">Psalm 86:12</a></div><div class="verse">I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with an undivided heart." <span class="cmt_word">And I will glorify thy Name</span> (see ver. 9) forevermore. A belief in immortality is implied, if not formally asserted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/86-13.htm">Psalm 86:13</a></div><div class="verse">For great <i>is</i> thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For great is thy mercy toward me</span> (see ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell</span>. The actual deliverance was from death (ver. 14); but death involved descent into Hades, so that those who were delivered from the one were at the same time delivered from the other. The expression translated "the lowest hell" means no more than "Hades which is beneath the earth." No comparison is made of one part of Hades with another.

He had declared that he was "merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin" (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>); he could not, therefore, desert the psalmist in his need. <span class="cmt_word">And gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth</span> (comp. above, ver. 5; and see also <a href="../../par/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>).

God had for a time turned his face away from his servant; now he is entreated to turn it towards him, and, as a consequence, to "have mercy upon him" and deliver him. <span class="cmt_word">Give thy strength unto thy servant.</span> Only in God's strength can we effectually contend against either our spiritual or our temporal foes.
