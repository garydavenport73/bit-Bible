This is "iniquity " - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>). Each aspect of sin has its own especial remedy, or manner of removal. The "transgression" is "lifted up," "taken away,"- <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - more vaguely <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The "sin" is "covered, .... hidden" - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The "iniquity" is "not imputed" - <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The union of all three, as here in vers. 1, 2, is complete remission or forgiveness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>is</i> the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <i>there is</i> no guile.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is the man unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity</span>. "Iniquity" - the defilement of the sinner's own soul by sin - is not at once removable; if removable at all, it is only so by long lapse of time, and God's special mercy. But God can, at his own will and at any moment, "not impute" it - not count it against the sinner to his detriment. Then in God's sight the man is clean; it is as though the iniquity were not there. And in whose spirit there is no guile; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no false seeming - no hypocrisy - where repentance has been sincere and real. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- When I kept silence</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. so</span> long as I did not acknowledge my sin - while I remained silent about it, quite aware that I hod sinned grievously, suffering in conscience, but not confessing it even to myself. The time spoken of is that which immediately followed the commission of the adultery, and which continued until Nathan uttered the words, "Thou art the man!" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I suffered grievous pain, both bodily and mental. My bones ached (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>); and I "roared," or groaned, in spirit, all the day long." Unconfessed sin rankles in the heart of a man who is not far gone in vice,  but has been surprised into a wicked action, no sooner done than regretted. Such a one, in Archbishop Leighton's words, "Vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igne." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a></div><div class="verse">For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me</span>. David sees now that his sufferings at this time came from God, and were a part of the punishment of his sin. They continued without intermission both by day and by night. His conscience was never wholly at rest. My moisture is turned into the drought of summer; literally, <span class="accented">my sap was changed through summer drought</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vital principle, which had been strong in him, was changed - burnt up and exhausted - by the heat of God's wrath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a></div><div class="verse">I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I acknowledged my sin unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). Conscience once fully awakened, all reticence was broken down. David confessed his sin fully and freely - confessed it as "sin," as "transgression," and as "iniquity" (compare the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And mine iniquity have I not hid;</span> rather, <span class="accented">did I not hide.</span> I did not attempt to gloss over or conceal the extent of my guilt, but laid my soul bare before thee. Hengstenberg well remarks that the psalmist is probably not speaking of a "making known by the mouth," but of "an inward confession, such as is accompanied with painful repentance and sorrow, with begging of pardon for sin and for the offence rendered to the Divine Majesty." <span class="cmt_word">I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</span> Upon David's confession, whether it were inward or outward, followed without any interval God's forgiveness - forgiveness which, however, did not preclude the exaction of a penalty required for the justification of God's ways to man (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>), and also, perhaps, for proper impressing of the offender himself, who would have been less sensible of the heinousness of his sin, if it had gone unpunished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a></div><div class="verse">For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this</span>; or, <span class="accented">because of this</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on account of this experience of mine - this immediate following of the grant of forgiveness upon confession of sin - <span class="cmt_word">shall every one that is godly</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that is sincere and earnest in religion, though he may be overtaken in a fault or surprised into a sin - <span class="cmt_word">pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in a time of finding</span>, which some understand as a time when God "finds," and visits, some iniquity in his servants, and others, as the Authorized Version, "in a time when thou art gracious, and allowest thyself to be found by those who approach thee." <span class="cmt_word">Surely in the floods of great waters they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the waters) <span class="cmt_word">shall not come nigh unto him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall not approach such a man to injure him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.

Hidden in God, there can no harm happen to him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.</span> "Songs of deliver-ante" are such songs as men sing when they have been delivered from peril. God will make such songs to sound in the psalmist's ears or in his heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - St. Jerome, and others after him, including Dr. Kay, have regarded this passage as an utterance of God, who first admonishes David, and then passes on to an admonition of the Israelites generally. But such a sudden intrusion of a Divine utterance, without any notice of a change of speaker, is without parallel in the Psalms, and should certainly not be admitted without some plain necessity. Here is no necessity at all. The words are quite suitable in the mouth of David, as an admonition to the Israelites of his time; they accord with the title, which he himself seems to have prefixed to the psalm, and explain it; and they fulfil the promise made in <a href="../../par/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">go.</span> We must suppose the "godly man" of ver. 6 addressed, if we regard David as the speaker. Such a man was not beyond the need of instruction and teaching, since he was liable to sins of infirmity, and even to grievous falls, as had been seen by David's example. <span class="cmt_word">I will guide thee with mine</span> <span class="cmt_word">eye;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will keep watch over thee with mine eye, and guide thee as I see to be necessary." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">Be ye not as the horse, <i>or</i> as the mule, <i>which</i> have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding</span>. The singular is exchanged for the plural, since the "instruction" is now intended, not for the godly man only, but for all. Israel had been always stiff-necked (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>), like a restive horse or mule. David exhorts them to be so no more. The horse and mule are excusable, since they "have no understanding " - or, "no discernment" - Israel would be inexcusable, since it had the gift of reason. <span class="cmt_word">Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose adornings are with bit and bridle to hold them in</span> (compare the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Lest they come near unto thee</span>. This clause is obscure. It may mean, "Lest they come <span class="accented">too</span> near to thee," so as to do thee damage, as when a riding horse tosses his head and strikes the rider in the face, or when a chariot horse rears and falls back upon the driver; or it may  mean, "Else they will not come near to thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until they are trapped with bit and bridle, they will refuse to come near to thee. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">Many sorrows <i>shall be</i> to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many sorrows shall be to the wicked</span>. A further warning to those addressed in the preceding verse. The LXX. emphasize this by substituting for the generic "sorrows" the specific <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "lashes," the usual punishment of the horse and mule. <span class="cmt_word">But he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/32-11.htm">Psalm 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <i>ye that are</i> upright in heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous</span>. David's psalms almost always end with a note of joy, or at any rate in a tone that is cheerful and encouraging. The present psalm, though reckoned among the penitential ones, both begins and ends with joyful utterances. In vers. 1, 2 David pours forth the feeling of gladness which fills his own heart. Here he calls upon the "righteous" generally, who yet need forgiveness, to rejoice with him. <span class="cmt_word">And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart</span>. All ye, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are honest and sincere in your endeavours after well-doing. The phrase explains the "righteous" of the preceding hemistich. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
