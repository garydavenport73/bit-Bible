The "way" intended is, no doubt, "the way of righteousness" (Psalm 1:7; 23:3, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Who walk in the Law of the Lord</span>. Compare the introductory paragraph for the meaning of "Law" in this psalm. This clause is exegetical of the preceding. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>are</i> they that keep his testimonies, <i>and that</i> seek him with the whole heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are they that keep his testimonies</span>. A variant expression for keeping the Law, rather than the specification of a particular part of it. <span class="cmt_word">And that seek him with the whole heart</span>. This is the emphatic portion of the verse. An obedience "from the heart" is alone acceptable to God (see <a href="../../par/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-34.htm">Psalm 119:34, 58, 69, 145</a>).

Positive righteousness includes negative. Those who walk always in God's Law (ver. 1) will, a <span class="accented">fortiori</span>, keep clear of all iniquity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-4.htm">Psalm 119:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast commanded <i>us</i> to keep thy precepts diligently.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast ordained thy precepts for diligent observance</span>, or <span class="accented">for men to observe them diligently</span>. Men sometimes give precepts which they do not care to have obeyed; but God's precepts are intended for careful, diligent, and continual observance. The "thou" at the beginning (<span class="accented">attah</span>) is emphatic. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-5.htm">Psalm 119:5</a></div><div class="verse">O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes</span>! The first four verses of the stanza are concerned with the Law in itself; the last four treat of the writer's relation to it. He begins by expressing the wish that he, at any rate, may always observe it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-6.htm">Psalm 119:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments</span>. In that case I shall not be ashamed, either before God or man. Shame follows transgression: I shall escape shame, if my obedience is perfect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-7.htm">Psalm 119:7</a></div><div class="verse">I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments</span>. But, before the Law can be observed, it must be known and understood. This, then, is the first thing. Then obedience and acceptable praise will follow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-8.htm">Psalm 119:8</a></div><div class="verse">I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will keep thy statutes</span>. This is my will and wish (see ver. 5); but, that I may be able to carry it out, O forsake me not utterly. Without thee I have no strength to do aright. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9</a></div><div class="verse">BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed <i>thereto</i> according to thy word.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way</span>? It does not follow from this inquiry that the writer is a "young man" - rather the reverse. He is anxious to give advice to young men, which is naturally the part of one somewhat advanced in life. <span class="cmt_word">By taking heed thereto, according to thy Word.</span> This is the answer to the question raised in clause 1. By looking to God's Word, and guiding himself thereby, the young man may "cleanse his way" - not otherwise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10</a></div><div class="verse">With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With my whole heart have I sought thee</span> (comp. ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">O let me not wander from thy commandments</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "let me not accidentally and through ignorance stray from the right path." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy Word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thy promise</span> (<span class="accented">imrah</span>). To have God's word of promise laid up in the heart is the only security against being surprised into sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-12.htm">Psalm 119:12</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes</span>. God's statutes are really known to those only whom God teaches. By nature we have but a faint glimmer of their meaning. God must teach us by his Spirit ere we can apprehend them aright. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-13.htm">Psalm 119:13</a></div><div class="verse">With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</span> "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." The "word" hid in the psalmist's heart (ver. 11) could not but rise to his lips on fit occasion, and be set forth before the people for their edification - more especially as there was an express command binding upon all Israelites to teach the Law to their children and dependants (see particularly <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-14.htm">Psalm 119:14</a></div><div class="verse">I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as <i>much as</i> in all riches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches</span> (comp. ver. 72). God's Word is a treasure, beyond expression precious, calculated to rejoice the heart of all such as possess it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-15.htm">Psalm 119:15</a></div><div class="verse">I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will meditate in thy precepts</span>. The full force of the Divine precepts is not to be grasped except by prolonged meditation on them. God's commandments are "exceeding broad" (ver. 96). <span class="cmt_word">And have</span> <span class="cmt_word">respect unto thy ways</span>; or, "consider them," "reflect upon them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-16.htm">Psalm 119:16</a></div><div class="verse">I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will delight myself in thy statutes</span> (comp. vers. 24, 40, 47, 70, 77, etc.; and see also <a href="../../par/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will not forget thy Word</span>. That which is "laid up in the heart" (ver. 11) can never be forgotten. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-17.htm">Psalm 119:17</a></div><div class="verse">GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant, <i>that</i> I may live, and keep thy word.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy Word</span>; rather, <span class="accented">grant unto thy servant that I may live</span>. Give me the blessing of a long life, that so my keeping of thy Word may be long. The psalmist seems to be praying especially for himself; but the argument of his prayer will extend to all "servants of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a></div><div class="verse">Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Open thou mine eyes</span>. Since the Fall, men's eyes are naturally blinded, or, at any rate, have a veil over them, which God must remove before they can see clearly (compare the comment on ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">That I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law</span>. Wonderful spiritual truths that lie hidden, even under the very simplest precepts of God's Law (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-37</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a stranger in the earth</span>; or, "a sojourner" (Cheyne, Kay, Revised Version); comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>. Earth is not our true home. We all "seek a country." <span class="cmt_word">Hide not thy commandments from me</span>. God "hides" things from the wise and prudent which he reveals to "babes." The psalmist prays that the true meaning of God's Word may not be kept back from him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a></div><div class="verse">My soul breaketh for the longing <i>that it hath</i> unto thy judgments at all times.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times</span>. This is given as a reason for the prayer of ver. 19. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are</i> cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast rebuked the proud</span>. It is difficult to connect this with the preceding. But perhaps the link may be found in the double sense of <span class="accented">mishpatim</span>, "judgments," which includes verbal sentences against sinners delivered in the Law, and also actual sentences upon them in deed and fact. These last are in the writer's mind in the present verse - such judgments as those upon Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-31</a>), Zerah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), and Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-37</a>). That are cursed. This clause is questioned, as metrically redundant. But Hebrew metrology is scarcely as yet an exact science. And the clause finds its justification in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which do err from thy commandments</span>. Such error brings under a curse those who commit it. If it be a blessed thing to walk in God's Law (ver. 1), it must be a cursed thing to transgress against it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/119-22.htm">Psalm 119:22</a></div><div class="verse">Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remove from me reproach and contempt</span>. God's servants almost necessarily incur the reproach and contempt of the worldly, to whom their conduct seems folly or madness. Christ himself was "despised;" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>) and reproached (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For I have kept thy testimonies</span> (comp. vers. 31, 51, 87, etc.).

Exegetical of the last clause of ver. 26. What the psalmist longs for is to have a perfect knowledge of God's Law in all its breadth (ver. 96) and depth (<a href="../../par/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>) and fullness. <span class="cmt_word">So shall I talk of thy wondrous works</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so will I muse upon thy marvels</span> (so Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version).

The study of God's commandments has long ago convinced the psalmist that they are no passing or temporary enactments, but eternal laws, decreed and laid down forever. The "testimonies" spoken of are, of course, the moral precepts of the Law, not its economical or political enactments.

The "affliction" intended is that which the psalmist suffers at the hands of his enemies, who "reproach" him (ver. 22), "deride" him (ver. 51), and otherwise "persecute" him (ver. 161). For I do not forget thy Law (comp. vers. 16, 83, 93, 109, 141, 176).
