The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into "perpetual ruins" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to "make havoc" of Israel "altogether;" and the enemy have spread themselves, and "burnt up all the houses of God in the land" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the time of the invasion of Shishak; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of the Babylonian conquest; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the early Maceabean period, or the reign of Judas Maccabaens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of the first is the ascription of the psalm in the "title" to Asaph. But all other considerations are against it. There is no evidence that Shishak ever entered Jerusalem. He certainly did not break down the carved work of the temple, or set the temple on fire, much less "cast it down to the ground." His invasion was a mere raid, and Rehoboam seems to have bought his retreat by the sacrifice of the temple treasury (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-12</a>). The circumstances described in the psalm are also unsuitable to the reign of Judas Maccabaeus, in whose time the temple suffered desecration at the hands of the Syrians, but was not seriously damaged, much less demolished. Thus the only date suitable for the composition of the psalm is that immediately following the capture of the city under Nebuchadnezzar.  We must explain the "title" by the consideration that Asaph, like Jeduthun and Heman, became a tribe name, attaching to all the descendants of the original Asaph, and was equivalent to "sou of Asaph" (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-44.htm">Nehemiah 7:44</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>). The psalm consists of three portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A complaint to God, including a description of all the horrors of the situation (vers. 1-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> An enumeration of God's mercies in the olden time, as a foundation for hope that he will yet rescue Israel (vers. 12-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An earnest prayer for relief and restoration, and the re-establishment of the covenant (vers. 18-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O God, why hast thou cast us off forever?</span> It could only have been in the extremity of distress that a devout Israelite believed, even for a time, that Israel was "<span class="accented">cast off forever"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, which must have been written nearly at the same period as this). <span class="cmt_word">Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span> God's anger "smokes" when it is hot and furious (see <a href="../../par/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>). It is now smoking "against the sheep of his pasture" - his own flock (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-53.htm">Psalm 78:53</a>), his peculiar people (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6, 17</a>; and <a href="../../par/psalms/79-13.htm">Psalm 79:13</a>).

They had also "burnt the house of the Lord "(ver. 9), and "broken down the walls of Jerusalem" (ver. 10) and the walls of the temple to a large extent (see below, ver. 7). It is quite certain that neither Shishak nor the Syrians under Antiochus Epiphanes created any such devastation.

It was, no doubt, the intention of Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel as a nation. Hence the complete destruction of the city and temple (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1-9</a>, etc.); hence the deportation of all the  <span class="accented">strength</span> of the nation (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and their settlement in the far off region of Babylonia; hence the desolation, not only of Jerusalem, but of "all the habitations of Jacob" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>), all the "strongholds of the daughter of Judah" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span> The synagogue system was first introduced by Ezra, according to Jewish tradition; and it has been argued that the mention of "synagogues" here - literally, "sacred meeting places" - proves the psalm to be Maccabean. But meeting places for worship, other than the temple, always existed in Palestine, both before and after its erection. Mesha speaks of having plundered a "house of Jehovah" in his war with Ahab ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11:p. 167); and it is plain from <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a> that religious meetings were held by the prophets, probably in houses devoted to the purpose, during the period of the divided monarchy. Hezekiah's destruction of the high places (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) is not likely to have interfered with the use of these buildings, to which no savour of idolatry can have attached in the mind of the most violent iconoclast. I should therefore believe, with Leopold Low, that buildings existed before the Exile, in which religious instruction was given by authorized teachers.

There is <span class="cmt_word">no more any prophet</span>. It has been said that this shows the psalm not to have been written on the occasion of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, since Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were, all of them, then living. But the writer only means to say that there are no prophets in Palestine, where he is residing. Jeremiah in Egypt, Ezekiel on the banks of Chebar, Daniel in Babylon, are nothing to him, even if he knows of their existence, and in no way fill up the gap whereof he complains. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there among us any who knoweth how long.</span> Jeremiah's prophecy of the seventy years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>) did net remove the doubt, since it was uncertain from what event the seventy years were to be counted. Jeremiah's prophecies, moreover, were not yet, in all probability, collected into a volume, and so may not have been known to the psalmist.

The deliverance from Egypt has the foremost place (vers. 13,14), as the most striking. Then the deliverance from the wilderness, and the passage of Jordan (ver. 15).

Israel is beautifully compared to a pet dove, the gentlest and tenderest of birds.

The "multitude of God's poor" is being carried off into a cruel captivity, or else left as a miserable remnant in an exhausted and desolated land - in either ease needing much God's protection and "remembrance."

Israel is being deprived of its inheritance, and dragged off into "dark places." Will not "respect for his covenant" induce God to interpose, and even now at the last gasp deliver his afflicted ones? <span class="cmt_word">For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</span> Israel is being dragged into "dark places of the earth" - benighted lands, where there is no glimmer of the light of God's truth - and lands, moreover, which are "full of habitations of cruelty," abodes, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, where captives taken in war are treated with harshness and violence.

In the ancient world the conquest of a people was always regarded as a triumph over the people's god or gods.
