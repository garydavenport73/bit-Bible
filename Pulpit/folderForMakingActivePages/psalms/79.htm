Israel - alike the people and the land - is "God's inheritance." <span class="cmt_word">Thy holy temple have they defiled</span>. The Babylonians defiled the temple by breaking into it, seizing its treasures and ornaments (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17-23</a>), and finally setting fire to it (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</span> This was certainly not done either by Shishak or by Antiochus Epiphanes; but was done, as prophesied (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>), by the Babylonians.

It is not the heathen that had never heard of God who are intended, but those who, having heard of him, had refused to "know" him (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>), as was the case with all the nations round about Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.</span> Now that we are punished, go on to punish those who have persecuted us, and who are at least as guilty as ourselves. "The prayer rests," as Hengstenberg remarks, "upon what God does constantly. Judgment begins at the house of God; but it proceeds thence to those whom God has employed as the instrument of his punishment. The storm of the wrath of God always remains to fall at last upon the world at enmity with his Church."

A triumph over a foreign nation was always regarded in the ancient world as a triumph over their gods. Their gods were bound to protect them, and, if they did not, must either have been absent or powerless (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">let there be shown forth among the heathen in our sight vengeance for the blood of thy servants that has been shed; or</span>, in other words, "Let an evident judgment, visible to us, fall upon the heathen who have shed the blood of our brethren, thy true servants."

The Babylonians treated their Jewish captives variously. Some, like Daniel and the "Three Children," were favoured, and exalted to high places.
