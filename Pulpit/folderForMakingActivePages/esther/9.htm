It was customary in all wars for the number of the slain to be carefully made out and recorded. In the Babylonian transcript of the Behistun Inscription the numbers are given with extreme exactness - e.g. 546, 2024, 4203, etc. On this occasion it would seem that only a rough calculation was made. Still the king took care to be informed on the subject, and the Jews, aware of this, were not left absolutely uncontrolled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what <i>is</i> thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what <i>is</i> thy request further? and it shall be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces?</span> Not an inquiry, but an exclamation.

It would seem that the Jews in Susa gathered themselves in the upper town on the appointed day, and were engaged there the whole day with their enemies. Esther asks that they may be allowed a second day - either in the upper or the lower town, it is not clear which to complete their work, and free themselves from all danger of further persecution from their foes. She is not likely to have made this request unless prompted to make it by Mordecai, who must have had means of knowing how matters really stood, and, as the chief minister over the whole nation, is likely to have been actuated rather by general views of policy than by a blind spirit of revenge. Still it must be granted that there is something essentially <span class="accented">Jewish</span> in Esther's request, and indeed in the tone of the entire book which bears her name 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-14.htm">Esther 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They hanged the ten sons of Haman</span>. Exposure on a cross was regarded as a deep disgrace, and was a punishment often inflicted by the Persians on persons killed in some other way (see Herod., 3:125; 7:238; Xen., 'Anab.,' 3. 1, &sect; 17; Pint., 'Vit.

The idea of "rest" seems out of place when the subject of the narrative is slaughter, and the number of the slain has still to be told. Some suspect corruption, others an interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">And slew of their foes seventy and five thousand.</span> The LXX. had in their copies fifteen for seventy-five, or one-fifth of the received number. The smaller number is more in harmony with the 500 killed at Susa than the larger one. FESTIVAL HELD, AND FEAST OF PURIM INSTITUTED (<a href="../../par/esther/9-17.htm">Esther 9:17-32</a>). A natural instinct led the Jews, so soon as their triumph was accomplished, to indulge themselves in a day of rest and rejoicing (ver. 17). After toil there is need of repose; and escape from a great danger is followed, almost of necessity, by "gladness." The writer of the Book of Esther, practising his usual reticence, says nothing of the character of the "gladness;" but we can scarcely be wrong in believing it to have been, in the main, religious, and to have included gratitude to God for their deliverance, the ascription of praise to his name, and an outpouring of the heart before him in earnest and prolonged thanksgiving. The circumstances of the struggle caused a difference, with regard to the date of the day of rejoicing, between the Jews of the capital and those of the provinces. The metropolitical Jews had two days of struggle, and could not "rest" until the third day, which was the 15th of Adar (ver. 18); the provincial Jews began and ended their work in one day, the 13th, and so their thanksgiving-day was the 14th, and not the 15th of the month (ver. 17). The consequence was, that when Mordecai and Esther determined on commemorating the wonderful deliverance of their time by an annual festival, analogous to that of the passover, to be celebrated by all Jews everywhere throughout all future ages, some hesitation naturally arose as to the proper day to be kept holy. If the 14th were kept, the provincial Jews would be satisfied, but those of Susa would have cause of complaint; if the 15th were the day selected, the two parties would simply exchange feelings. Under these circumstances it was wisely resolved to keep both days (ver. 21). Nothing seems to have been determined as to the mode of keeping the feast, except that both days were to be "days of feasting and joy," and days upon which the richer members of the community should send "portions" and "gifts" to the poorer ones (ver. 22). The name, "feast of Purina," was at once attached to the festival, in memory of Haman's consultation of the lot, the word "Pur" meaning "lot" in Persian (ver. 24). The festival became a national institution by the general consent of the Jews everywhere (ver. 27), and has remained to the present day among the most cherished of their usages, it falls in early spring, a month before the passover, and occupies two days, which are still those fixed by Mordecai and Esther, the 14th and 15th of Adar. The day preceding the feast is observed as a fast day, in commemoration of Esther's fast before going in uninvited to the king (<a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).

Here walls are not at all in the thought of the writer, who intends a contrast between the Jews of the metropolis and those of the provinces. Ecbatana and Babylon are "<span class="accented">country</span> towns" to a Jew of Susa, such as the writer. <span class="cmt_word">A good day</span>.

Mordecai had no ecclesiastical authority; and it might have been expected that the Jews of Jerusalem would have demurred to the imposition of a fresh religious obligation upon them by a Jew of the Dispersion, who was neither a prophet, nor a priest, nor even a Levite. The Jews of Jerusalem, in their strongly-situated city, which was wholly theirs, and with their temple-fortress complete (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>), can scarcely have felt themselves in much danger from an attack which was to have begun and ended in a day. But Joiakim, the high priest of the time (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10-12</a>), to whom, as we have seen ('Introduction,' &sect; 3), the Book of Esther was attributed by some, must have given his approval to the feast from the first, and have adopted it into the ceremonial of the nation, or it would scarcely have become universal. Hooker ('Eccl. Pol.,' 5:71, &sect; 6) rightly makes the establishment of the feast an argument in favour of the Church's power to prescribe festival days; and it must certainly have been by ecclesiastical, and not by civil, command that it became obligatory. <span class="cmt_word">That these days... should not fail,...  nor the memorial of them perish</span>. As a commemoration of human, and not of Divine, appointment, the feast of Purim was liable to abrogation or discontinuance. The Jews of the time resolved that the observance should be perpetual; and in point of fact the feast has continued up to the present date, and is likely to continue, though they could not bind their successors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-29.htm">Esther 9:29</a></div><div class="verse">Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail,...  wrote</span>. The unusual designation of Esther as "daughter of Abihail" can only be accounted for by her having so designated herself in the letter. <span class="cmt_word">With all authority</span>. Rather, "with all earnestness," or "impressiveness." Literally, the word used means "strength." <span class="cmt_word">To confirm this second letter of Purina</span>. The <span class="accented">first</span> letter is the one which is mentioned in vers. 20 and 26. That letter having elicited the favourable reply contained in vers. 26-28, a "second letter of Purina" was now issued, "confirming" and establishing the observance. It went forth not as an edict, or in the king's name, but as a letter, and in the names of Esther and Mordecai. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-30.htm">Esther 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>with</i> words of peace and truth,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sent the letters</span>. Rather, "he sent letters." In addition to the formal "letter of Purina," which was of the nature of an ordinance, though not of legal force, Mordecai sent informal letters, which embraced other topics besides the Purim feast, as, for instance, words of salutation, and perhaps a reference to the keeping of a fast before the two Purina days (ver. 31). These he sent to all Jews throughout the whole empire, inclosing with them the formal "letter of Purim." <span class="cmt_word">With words of peace and truth</span>. Perhaps beginning thus: "Peace and truth be with you" - a modification of the usual, "Peace," etc. (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>), or, "All peace" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 5:7), with which letters ordinarily began. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-31.htm">Esther 9:31</a></div><div class="verse">To confirm these days of Purim in their times <i>appointed</i>, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they had decreed for themselves and their seed</span>. "As they - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews generally - had decreed" (see ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">The matters of the fastings and their cry</span>. These words stand in no clear grammatical relation to the preceding, and are otherwise very difficult to explain. They are thought to allude to the establishment by the provincial Jews, apart from Mordecai and Esther, of the 13th of Adar as a day of fasting and wailing; but if so, it is strange that nothing has been previously said of this ordinance. The plural form of the word for "fastings" is also suspicious, since it does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. Altogether, it is perhaps most probable that the words were originally the gloss of a commentator, written in the margin, and that they have been accidentally transferred to the text. They do not occur in the Septuagint. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/esther/9-32.htm">Esther 9:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The decree of Esther</span>. Rather, "a commandment of Esther." Some fresh act seems to be intended - something beyond the joint letter of Esther and Mordecai; though why it was needed, or what additional authority it could give, is not apparent. <span class="cmt_word">And it was written in the book</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "this commandment of Esther was inserted in the book of the chronicles," where the writer probably found it. No other book being mentioned in Esther but this, "the book" can have no other meaning (see <a href="../../par/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../esther/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Esther 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Esther 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../esther/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Esther 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Esther 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
