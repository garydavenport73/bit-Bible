After the beginning of the first missionary journey (A.D. 45) he seems to have finally abandoned his Hebrew name of Saul. Called. The word "called" is absent from A, D, E, and other manuscripts, but may have been omitted as superfluous. It occurs in the greeting of <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, but not in any other Epistle. The words might also be rendered "a called or chosen apostle." To be an apostle. He uses this title in every letter except the private one to Philemon, the peculiarly friendly and informal one to the Philippians, and the two to the Thessalonians, which were written before the Judaizers had challenged his claim to this title in its more special sense. The Epistle to the Romans is the first in which he calls himself "a <span class="accented">slave</span> of Jesus Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1.htm">Jude 1</a>). It was necessary for him to assert his right to the apostolate in the highest sense of the word, as one who had received from Christ himself an authority equal to that of the twelve (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1-19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Of Jesus Christ.</span> In the Gospels the word "Christ" is all but invariably "<span class="accented">the</span> Christ," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Anointed, the Messiah. It is the designation of the office of Jesus as the promised Deliverer. We trace in the New Testament the gradual transition of the word from a title into a proper name. In the two names together our Lord is represented as "the Saviour," and the anointed Prophet, Priest, and King, first of the chosen people and then of all mankind. <span class="cmt_word">Through the will of God</span> (comp. 2 Corinthians 1 Ephesians Colossians <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>). This <span class="accented">special</span> call to the apostleship is emphatically expanded in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>. The vindication of the Divine and independent claim was essential to St. Paul's work. It was not due to any personal considerations, but to the necessity of proving that no human authority could be quoted to overthrow the gospel which was peculiarly "his gospel" (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>), of which one main feature was the freedom of the Gentiles from the yoke of Judaic bondage. And Soathenes. The association of one or more brethren with himself in the greeting of his letters is peculiar to St. Paul. Silas and Timothy are associated with him in 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and Timothy, though so much his junior, in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon; doubtless he would have been associated with St. Paul in this Epistle had he not been absent (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>). The practice arose partly from St. Paul's exquisite courtesy and consideration towards his companions, partly from his shrinking from mere personal prominence. It is owing to the same reasons that in the earlier Epistles he constantly uses "we" for "I," and sometimes when he can only be speaking of himself (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>). But even in the Epistles to the Thessalonians he sometimes relapses from "we" into "I" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>). Our brother; literally, the <span class="accented">brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of <span class="accented">"the</span> brethren" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>). Of Sosthenes nothing whatever is known. He may possibly be the amanuensis whom St. Paul employed for this letter. Later tradition, which in such matters is perfectly valueless, spoke of him as" one of the seventy disciples, and Bishop of Colophon" (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:12). There is a Jewish Sosthenes, a ruler of the synagogue, in <a href="../../par/acts/18-17.htm">Acts 18:17</a>; but it is only a vague conjecture that he may have been subsequently converted, and may have joined St. Paul at Ephesus. It is obvious that the persons named in the greetings of the Epistles were not in any way supposed to be responsible for their contents, lot St. Paul begins with "I" in ver. 4. <span class="accented">Brother.</span> At this time there was no recognized title for Christians. In the Acts they are vaguely spoken of as "those of this way." Among themselves they were known as "the saints," "the faithful," "the elect." The name "Christians" was originally a nickname devised by the Antiochenes. In the New Testament it only occurs as a designation used by enemies (<a href="../../par/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i>to be</i> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> This form of address is used in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. In St. Paul's later Epistles, for some unknown reason, he prefers the address "to the saints." These forms of address show the absence of any fixed ecclesiastical government. He does not in this Epistle address any "bishops" or "presbyters" whom he might regard as responsible for the growing disorders which prevailed at Corinth, but he appeals to the whole Church. The word <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> - signifying those who were "called out of the world," and so primarily applied to "the congregation of Israel" - came ultimately to mean "a congregation." The only apostle who uses the word "synagogue" of the Christian assemblies is St. James (<a href="../../par/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of God.</span> Not the Church of this or that party leader. Some commentators give to these words an emphasis and importance which does not seem to belong to them. <span class="cmt_word">Which is at Corinth.</span> So in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians he prefers the form, "the Church of the <span class="accented">Thessalonians."</span> "The Church at Corinth" was an expression which involved the sharpest of contrasts. It brought into juxtaposition the holiest ideal of the new faith and the vilest degradations of the old paganism. It was "a glad and great paradox" (Bengel). The condition of society at Corinth, at once depraved and sophistical, throws light on many parts of the Epistle. Cicero describes the city as <span class="accented">"illus</span>trious a like for <span class="accented">wantonness</span>, opulence, and the study of philosophy." <span class="cmt_word">Even them that are sanctified.</span> The apostles could only write to Churches as being <span class="accented">really</span> Churches, and to Christians as being true Christians. In all general addresses they could only assume that the <span class="accented">actual</span> resembled the <span class="accented">ideal.</span> They never conceal the immense chasm which separated the real condition of many members of their Churches from the vocation which they professed. They <span class="accented">knew</span> also that it is (as Calvin says) "a perilous temptation to refuse the name of Church to every Church in which there is not perfect purity." Ideally even the Corinthian Christians were redeemed by Christ's expiation, consecrated and sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit. They could only be addressed in accordance with their ostensible position (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1; 5:68). Our Prayer book is constructed on the same principle. The harvest is still a harvest, though amongst the corn there may be many tares. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus</span>. The words, "in Christ," constitute what has been happily called "the monogram of St. Paul." The life of the true Christian is no longer his own. The Christ for him has become the Christ <span class="accented">in</span> him. His natural life is merged into a higher spiritual life. Baptized <span class="accented">into</span> Christ, he has become one with Christ. Called to be saints. (On this Christian calling, see <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>.) They are called to be united saints, not schismatic partisans or members of antagonistic cliques. The description of what they were <span class="accented">ideally</span> is the more emphatic because he feels how much they had fallen away. <span class="cmt_word">With all that...  in every place.</span> Perhaps this may mean the same as <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, "With all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia;" or the words may imply that St. Paul's exhortations are applicable to all Christians, wherever they may be and (as is expressed in the next clause) whatever may be their varying shades of individual opinion. It was well in any case to remind the Corinthians that they formed but a fraction of the Christian communities. Catholicity, not provincialism, makes the true Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">Call upon the Name.</span> The Greek verb is here in the middle voice, not "who are called by the Name"(comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, LXX.). It means, therefore, all who reverence the Name of Christ, all who adore their one "Lord" in the fulness of his nature (see <a href="../../par/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10.htm">Romans 10</a>:24; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, etc.); in other words, "all who profess and call themselves Christians" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their Lord and ours</span>. I connect these words, not with "place," as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">In omni loco ipsorum et nostro -</span> which, however it may be twisted, can give no good sense - but with "Jesus Christ." It has been in all ages a fatal temptation of party Christians to claim a monopoly of Christ for themselves and their own sects, as though <span class="accented">they</span> only taught the gospel, and were the <span class="accented">only</span> Christians or the <span class="accented">only</span> "Evangelicals." But Christ cannot thus be "parcelled into fragments" (see vers. 12, 13), nor has any party a right to boast exclusively, "I am of Christ." The addition, "and ours," could not be regarded as super fluous in writing to a Church of which one section wanted to assert an exclusive right in Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace.</span> This is St. Paul's greeting in all the Epistles except the pastoral Epistles, in which he beautifully adds the word "mercy." It is a remarkable blending of the Greek and Jewish salutations. The Greeks said <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and to them the word "grace" involved the notions of joy and brightness and prosperity. The calmer and more solemn greeting of the East was, "Peace be to thee." The Church unites both forms of greeting - "grace," the beginning of every blessing; "peace," the end of all blessings; and into both she infuses a deeper meaning, that of a "joy" which defied all tribulations, and a" peace which passeth all understanding." <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> God is the Source of "every good gift and every perfect gift." God is our Father as our Creator, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we become, in a higher sense, his children. Christ, in his mediatorial kingdom, is specially and immediately "our Lord," though that phrase, now so universal, only occurs (in its isolated form) in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>. <span class="accented">Jesus Christ.</span> One of St. Paul's peculiarities of style is the constant reiteration of one dominant word. In the first nine verses of this Epistle, the Name "Jesus Christ" is repeated no less than nine times. "Observe," says St. Chrysostom, "how he <span class="accented">nails them down</span> to the Name of Christ, not mentioning any man, either apostle or teacher, but continually mentioning him for whom they yearn, as men preparing to awaken those who are drowsy after a debauch. For nowhere in any other Epistle is the Name of Christ so continually introduced By means of it he weaves together almost his whole exordium."

In St. Paul, however, this thanksgiving is the natural overflow of a full heart. It was no mere compliment or rhetorical artifice like the <span class="accented">captatio benevolentiae</span>, or endeavouring to win the hearers by flattery, which we find in most ancient speeches. <span class="accented">My God</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Always</span>; that is, constantly; on all occasions of special prayer.

He always regards and speaks of the life of the soul as summed up potentially in one supreme moment and crisis - namely, the moment of conversion and baptism. The grace given once was given for ever, and was continually manifested. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus.</span> St. Paul regarded the life of the Christian as "hid with Christ in God," and of Christ as <span class="accented">being</span> the Christian's life (see <a href="../../par/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11</a>, etc.).

There would be little or no harm in the <span class="accented">schismata</span> so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in "contentions" (<span class="accented">erides</span>) and "factions" (<span class="accented">haireseis</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. <span class="cmt_word">Perfected together;</span> literally, <span class="accented">repaired, reunited.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In the same mind and in the same judgment</span>; that is, in what they think and believe (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), and in what they assert and do (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>).

It has been conjectured that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, Corinthians who were now with St. Paul at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:16</a>), may have been Chloe's slaves or freedmen. <span class="cmt_word">Contentions.</span> These are the works of the flesh (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>). The condition of the Church was the same when St. Clement of Rome wrote to them. He had still to complain of the "strange and alien and, for the elect of God, detest able and unholy spirit of faction which a few rash and self willed persons kindled to such a pitch of dementation" ('Ep. ad Corinthians 1.').

They prided themselves on being "uncompromising" and "party men." <span class="accented">Saith</span>; in a self-assertive way (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am of Paul.</span> He shows his indignation at their partisanship by first rebuking those who had used <span class="accented">his own name</span> as a party watchward. He disliked Paulinism as much as Petrinism (Bengel). All the Corinthians would probably have been in this sense Paulinists but for the visits of subsequent teachers. At present the Paul party consisted of those who adhered to his views about Gentile freedom, and who liked the simple spirituality of his teaching. St. Paul rose above the temptation of considering that party spirit is excusable in our own partisans. He reproves factiousness even in the party of freedom. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Apollos.</span> Apollos personally was absolutely loyal and honourable, but his visit to Corinth had done mischief. His impassioned oratory, his Alexandrian refinements, his allegorizing exegesis, the culture and polish of his style, had charmed the fickle Corinthians. The Apollonians were the party of culture. They had, as we see from later parts of the Epistle, exaggerated St. Paul's views, as expounded by Apollos, into extravagance. Puffed up with the conceit of knowledge, they had fallen into moral inconsistency. The egotism of oratorical rivals, the contemptuous tone to wards weaker brethren, the sophistical condonations of vice, were probably due to them. Apollos, as we see by his noble refusal to visit Corinth under present circumstances (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>), was as indignant as St. Paul himself at the perversion of his name into an engine of party warfare. (On Apollos, see <a href="../../par/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a> <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>.) Nothing further is known respecting him, but he is the almost undoubted author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which proves that he was of the school of St. Paul, while at the same time he showed a splendid originality in his way of arriving at the same conclusion as his teacher. <span class="cmt_word">I of Cephas</span>. The use of the Aramaic name (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>), perhaps, shows that these Petrinists were Judaizers (though it should be added that St. Paul only uses the name "Peter" in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). They personally disliked St. Paul, and questioned his apostolical authority. Perhaps the extravagances of the "speaking with tongues" arose in this party, who recalled the effects of the outpouring of the Spirit after Peter's great sermon on the day of Pentecost. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Christ.</span> We trace the origin of this party to one man in particular (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>), who was, or professed to be, an adherent of James, and therefore one of the more rigid Judaizers. He may have been one from the circle of Christ's earthly relatives - one of the Desposyni (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>), and, like St. James, may have had views resembling those of the Essenes and Ebionites. If so, he was probably the author of the questions about celibacy and marriage; and perhaps he prided himself on having seen "Christ in the flesh." This party at any rate, like some modern sects, was not ashamed to degrade into a party watchword even the sacred name of Christ, and to claim for a miserable clique an exclusive interest in the Lord of the whole Church. It is the privilege of every Christian to say, "Christianus sum;" but if he says it in a haughty, loveless, and exclusive spirit, he forfeits his own claim to the title. This exclusive Christ party is, perhaps, specially alluded to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-7.htm">2 Corinthians 10:7-11</a>. The view of Chrysostom, which takes these words to be St. Paul's remark - "But I belong to Christ," is untenable, and would make trim guilty of the very self-assertiveness which he is reprobating.

"Is there a Pauline, a Petrine, an Apollonian, a Christian Christ?" Whether you call yourselves Liberals, or Intellectualists, or Catholics, or Bible Christians, your party spirit is a sin, and all the worse a sin because it pranks itself out in the guise of pure religious zeal. This is more forcible than to take the clause affirmatively:" Christ has been parcelled into fragments." In either ease we see" the tragic result of party spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Was Paul crucified for you?</span> Again he rebukes the partisanship which attached itself to his own name.

The introduction of the question by the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> expresses astonished indignation: "Can you possibly make a watchword of the name of a mere man, as though he had been crucified for you?" This outburst of feeling is very important, as proving the immeasurable distance which, in Paul's own view, separated him from his Lord. It is also instructive to see how St. Paul at once denounces the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of party without deigning to enter into the question as to <span class="accented">which</span> party of these wrangling "theologians" was most or least in the right.

Gaius of Corinth (<a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>). It was one of the commonest of names.

It shows the heroic character of the faith of St. Paul that he deliberately preached the doctrine of the cross because he felt that therein lay the conversion and salvation of the world, although he was well aware that he could preach no truth so certain at first to revolt the unregenerate hearts of his hearers. To the Jews "the cross" was the tree of shame and horror; and a crucified person was "accursed of God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). To the Greeks the cross was the gibbet of a slave's infamy and a murderer's punishment. There was not a single association connected with it except those of shame and agony. The thought of "a crucified Messiah" seemed to the Jews a revolting folly; the worship of a crucified malefactor seemed to the Greeks "an execrable superstition" (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44; Pliny, 'Epp.' 10:97); yet so little did St. Paul seek for popularity or immediate success, that this was the very doctrine which he put in the forefront, even at a city so refined and so voluptuous as Corinth. And the result proved his inspired wisdom. That very cross became the recognized badge of Christianity, and when three centuries had elapsed it was woven in gold upon the banners and set in jewels on the diadems of the Roman empire. For had not Christ prophesied, And I, <span class="accented">if I be lifted up</span>, will draw all men unto me"? <span class="cmt_word">Unto us which are being saved;</span> who are on the way of salvation. The same present participle is used in <a href="../../par/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>. It is the power of God. Because the cross is at the heart of that gospel which is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), though many were tempted to be ashamed of it.

Even the rabbis say that when Messiah comes human wisdom is to become needless. <span class="cmt_word">Of the world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of this age</span>, or <span class="accented">aeon.</span> The old dispensation, then so rapidly waning to its close, was called "this age" (<span class="accented">olam hazzeh</span>); the next or Messianic age was called "the age to come" (<span class="accented">olam habba</span>). The Messianic age had dawned at the birth of Christ, but the old covenant was not finally annulled till his second coming at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Did not God</span> (by the cross) <span class="accented">stultify the wisdom</span>, etc.? The oxymoron, or sharp contrast of terms - a figure of which St. Paul is fond (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, etc.; and my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:628) - is here clearly marked in the Greek. The thought was as familiar to the old prophets (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>) as to St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>); and even Horace saw that heathen philosophy was sometimes no better than <span class="accented">insaniens sapientia</span> (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:34, 2).

The notion of a suffering and humiliated Messiah, who reduced them to the level of all God's other children, was to them "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>). These two verses, translated into Syriac, furnish a marked play on words (<span class="accented">miscol</span>, stumbling block; <span class="accented">mashcal</span>, folly; <span class="accented">seed</span>, cross); and some have seen in this a sign that St. Paul <span class="accented">thought</span> in Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Greeks;</span> rather, <span class="accented">unto Gentiles</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, I). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Jews...  unto the Greeks.</span> Both alike had failed.

The accent of profound contempt is discernible in all the early allusions of Greeks and Romans to Christianity. The only epithets which they could find for it were "execrable," "malefic," "depraved," "damnable" (Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, etc.). The milder term is "excessive superstition." The heroic constancy of martyrs appeared even to M. Aurelius only under the aspect of a "bare obstinacy." The word used to express the scorn of the Athenian philosophers for St. Paul's "strange doctrine" is one of the coarsest disdain (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and they called him "a seed pecker" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18, 32</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a mere picker up of "learning's crumbs."

St. Paul is the best commentator on himself. He speaks elsewhere of "the exceeding greatness of God's <span class="accented">power</span> to usward who believe which he wrought in Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-20</a>), and of "all the treasures of <span class="accented">wisdom</span> and knowledge" as being "hid in Christ" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). And the world, once so scornful, has learnt that Christ is indeed the <span class="accented">Power</span> of God. When Rudolph of Hapsburgh was being crowned, and in the hurry no sceptre could be found, he seized a crucifix, and swore that that should be his only sceptre. When St. Thomas of Aquinum asked St. Bonaventura what was the source of his immense learning, he pointed in silence to his crucifix.

But God achieves the mightiest ends by the humblest means, and the gospel of Christ allied itself from the first, not with the world's strength and splendour, but with all which the world despised as mean and feeble - with fishermen and tax gatherers, with slaves, and women, and artizans. The lesson was specially needful to the Corinthians, whom Cicero describes ('De Leg. Age,' 2:32) as "famous, not only for their luxuriousness, but also for their wealth and philosophic culture."

The Sanhedrin looked down on the apostles as "unlearned and ignorant men" (<a href="../../par/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>). <span class="accented">"God,"</span> says St. Augustine, "caught orators by fishermen, not fishermen by orators." <span class="cmt_word">Not many mighty</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not many persons of power and influence. Almost the first avowed Gentile Christian of the highest rank was the consul Flavius Clemens, uncle of the Emperor Domitian. This was the more marked because <span class="accented">the Jews</span> won many rich and noble proselytes, such as the Queen Helena and the royal family of Adiabene, Poppaea the wife of Nero, and others. The only illustrious converts mentioned in the New Testament are Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Sergius Paulus, and Dionysius the Areopagitc. <span class="cmt_word">Not many noble.</span> All this was a frequent taunt against Christians, but they made it their boast. Christianity came to redeem and elevate, not the few, but the many, and the many must ever be the weak and the humble. Hence Christ called fishermen as his apostles, and was known as "the Friend of publicans and sinners." None of the rulers believed on him (<a href="../../par/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). It must, however, be borne in mind that these words apply mainly and primarily to the first age of Christianity. It was essential that its victory should be due to Divine weapons only, and that it should shake the world "by the irresistible might of weakness." After a time, the wisest and the noblest and the most powerful were called. Kings became the nursing fathers of the gospel, and queens its nursing mothers. Yet the ideal truth remains, and human power shows utter weakness, and human wisdom is capable of sinking into the depths of folly.

In this and in many instances the change of tense is unimportant, but sometimes it materially and injuriously affects the sense. <span class="cmt_word">The foolish things... the weak things.</span> So, too, the psalmist, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength" (<a href="../../par/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>); and St. James, "Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith?"
