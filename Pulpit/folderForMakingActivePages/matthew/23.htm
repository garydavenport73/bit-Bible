Some small portion of this discourse, the close of our Lord's public teaching, is found in <a href="../../par/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38-40</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/20-45.htm">Luke 20:45-47</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/luke/11.htm">Luke 11, 13</a>.). It is here addressed to the multitude, and to his disciples, and seems to have been designed to comfort the former under the difficulty of having accredited teachers who were proved to have misunderstood Scripture, and were incapable of interpreting it aright. He willed to show how far they were to follow these instructors, and where it was necessary to draw a line beyond which they were not to be obeyed. Some modern critics have suggested that this discourse was not spoken at this time, but that St. Matthew has here collected into one body certain sayings of our Lord uttered at different times and places. It is far more natural to suppose that St. Matthew's statement of the occasion of this discourse is historically true, and that Christ here repeated some parts of the censure he had already, in the course of his ministry, found it necessary to pronounce. The unity of this utterance in form and essence, its logical sequence and climactic character, prove that it was delivered at one time, and was intended to form the Lord's farewell address to the wayward people who would not come unto him that they might have life. The discourse may be divided into three parts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The moral character of the scribes and Pharisees, and warning to Christ's disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.</span> In the seat of the great  judge and lawgiver. This is stated as an undoubted fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), with no idea of blame attached. Literally, <span class="accented">sat on the seat of Moses</span> from time immemorial. These (meaning not individuals, but the collective body) are the authorized expounders and teachers of the Law; their position is assured; they are not to be displaced. The scribes were the party chiefly denoted; they were of the Pharisaical sect; hence the addition, "and the Pharisees," by which is intimated, not that these latter, <span class="accented">qua</span> Pharisees, had any teaching office, but that the former shared their religious opinions. The Sadducees seem to have had no popular influence, and were never recognized as leaders. The Levitical priests never appear in the Gospels as teachers or expositors of the Mosaic system; this function of theirs had devolved upon scribes and lawyers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-3.htm">Matthew 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <i>that</i> observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All therefore.</span> It is because of their official authority as appointed teachers and expositors of the Law that Christ gives the following injunction. That observe and do. Many manuscripts and versions invert the order of the verbs, reading, <span class="accented">do and observe.</span> The received text seems most logical. <span class="accented">Observe</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, present imperative, continue to observe as a rule of conduct. <span class="accented">Do</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, aorist, do immediately, whenever the occasion arises. All that they taught or commanded out of the Law, or in due accordance therewith, was to be observed and obeyed. The statement is made in general terms, but was conditional and restricted by other considerations. It was only their official injunctions, derived immediately from Scripture, not their glosses, evasions, and interpretations, that were to be regarded with respect. The Lord had already taken occasion to warn against these errors (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6, 11, 12</a>, etc.). As inheritors of the authority of Moses, and speaking <span class="accented">ex cathedra</span>, they were so far worthy of respect. This principle laid down, Christ proceeds to denounce their evil practices. <span class="cmt_word">After their works.</span> You must distinguish between their preaching and their practice; the latter is to be shunned with all care. The scribes are never accused of corrupting the sacred text, which, indeed, was scrupulously guarded, and kept pure and unaltered. It was their treatment of the doctrines thereof that was censured. Our Lord shows their evil example in two particulars - their principle was "words, not deeds" (ver. 4), and ostentation in religion (vers. 5-7). <span class="cmt_word">They say, and do not.</span> They enunciated the Law, they enjoined obedience to it in the minutest particulars, and yet they themselves continually, in the most important points (ver. 23), infringed, neglected, evaded it. St. Paul, himself a strict Pharisee, denounces in stern language such inconsistent professors (<a href="../../par/romans/2-21.htm">Romans 2:21-23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay <i>them</i> on men's shoulders; but they <i>themselves</i> will not move them with one of their fingers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">importabilia</span> (Vulgate). The last epithet, which is very uncommon (<a href="../../par/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>), is omitted by some manuscripts and versions, but it is probably genuine here. The burdens are the minute regulations and prescriptions, the vexatious restrictions, the innumerable traditional observances with which these teachers had garbled and defaced the written Law. We have noticed some of these glosses in the matter of the sabbath and ceremonial purification; and these are only specimens of a system which extended to every relation of life, and to all details of religious practice, binding one rule to another, enforcing useless and absurd minutiae, till the burden became insupportable. Alford considers that not human traditions and observances are signified by the "burdens," but the severity of the Law, the weighty duties inculcated therein, which they enforce on others, but do not observe. It may, however, well be doubted whether Christ would ever have termed the legitimate rites and ceremonies of the Law unbearable burdens, though their rigorous enforcement by men who regarded only the letter, while they had lost the spirit, would naturally deserve censure. (If the epithet is not genuine, of course this remark does not apply.) What Christ denounced was not the Law itself, however severe and grievous to human nature, or even immemorial tradition, but the false inferences and deductions therefrom, leading to injunctions insupportable and impracticable. <span class="cmt_word">Will not move them with one of their fingers;</span> <span class="accented">with their finger.</span> This does not imply (and it would not be true) that the rabbis themselves were all hypocrites, and broke or evaded the Law with impunity. We know that they scrupulously attended to all outward observances. What is meant is that they take no trouble to lighten (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to move away"), to make these burdens easier by explanation or relaxation, or to proportion them to the strength of the disciple. They impose them with all their crushing weight and severity upon others, and uncompromisingly demand obedience to these unscriptural regulations, putting "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (<a href="../../par/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Contrast with this the Christian's service: "My yoke is easy," says Christ, "and my burden is light" (ch. 11:33). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to be seen of men.</span> The second bad principle in their religion was ostentation and vanity. Acts done professedly in the honour of God were animated  by self-seeking and ambition. They never penetrated beyond externalism. See this spirit reproved in the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). "They loved the glory of men more than the glory of God" (<a href="../../par/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>). Christ then gives proofs of this spirit of ostentation in religion and in private life. <span class="cmt_word">Phylacteries</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">preservatives</span>; equivalent to "amulets;" the translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, "prayer fillets." These were either strips of parchment or small cubes covered with leather, on or in which were written four sections of the Law, viz. <a href="../../par/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1-10, 11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>. They were worn fastened either to the forehead, or inside the left arm, so as to be near the heart. Their use arose from a literal and superstitious interpretation of <a href="../../par/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. Their dimensions were defined by rabbinical rules, but the extra pious formalists of the day set these at naught, and increased the breadth of the strips or of the bands by which they were fastened, in order to draw attention to their religiousness and their strict attention to the least observances of the Law. These phylacteries are still in use among the Jews. Thus in a 'Class Book for Jewish Youth' we read, "Every boy, three months before he attains the age of thirteen, commences to make use of the tephillin, which must be worn at least during the time of the morning prayers. The ordinance of the tephillin is one of the signs of the covenant existing between the Almighty and ourselves, that we may continually bear in mind the miracles God wrought for our forefathers." <span class="cmt_word">Enlarge the borders of their garments;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the fringes of their outer garments.</span> The best manuscripts have merely <span class="accented">their fringes.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">magnificant fimbrias.</span> These fringes or tassels (<span class="accented">zizith, zizijoth</span>) were fastened to the corners of the garments, in accordance with <a href="../../par/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>, and were composed of white and blue threads. They were intended to remind the wearers of the commandments of the Lord, and were regarded as peculiarly sacred (see <a href="../../par/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>). Christ condemns the ostentatious enlargement of these fringes as a badge of extraordinary piety and obedience. We quote again from the Jewish 'Class. Book:' "Every male of the Jewish nation must wear a garment [not usually an undergarment] made with four corners, having fringes fixed at each corner. These fringes are called <span class="accented">tsetsis</span>, or, memorial fringes. In the synagogue, during the morning prayers, a scarf with fringes attached to it is worn, which is called <span class="accented">tollece</span>, 'scarf or veil.' These memorial fringes typically point out the six hundred and thirteen precepts contained in the volume of the sacred Law. They are also intended to remind us of the goodness of the Almighty in having delivered our forefathers from the slavery in Egypt." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The uppermost rooms;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">primos recubitus</span>; <span class="accented">chief place</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). The custom of reclining on cushions set in horseshoe fashion at three sides of the table was now prevalent, the old custom of squatting round a low table, as at present practised in the East, having been long abandoned. The place of honour is said to have been at the upper end of the right side, the president being placed, not in the centre of that end of the table which faced the opening, but at the side. The most honoured guest would be at his right hand (but see on Matthew 26:23). There was often much manoeuvring to obtain this post, and many petty squabbles about precedence arose on every festal occasion (see <a href="../../par/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1, 7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The chief seats in the synagogues.</span> The usual arrangement of the synagogue is given by Dr. Edersheim ('Life and Times of Jesus,' 1. pp. 434, etc.). It was built of stone, with an entrance generally on the south, and so arranged that the worshippers might direct their prayers towards Jerusalem. In the centre was placed the lectern of the reader; the women's gallery was at the north end. "The inside plan is generally that of two double colonnades, which seem to have formed the body of the synagogue, the aisles east and west being probably used as passages. At the south end, facing north, is a movable ark, containing the sacred rolls of the Law and the prophets. Right before the ark, and facing the people, are the seats of honour, for the rulers of the synagogue and the honourable." These were the places for which the Pharisees contended, thinking more of gaining these, where they could sit enthroned in the sight of the congregation, than of the Divine worship which nominally they came to offer (comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2, 3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-7.htm">Matthew 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Greetings in the markets.</span> They loved to be denoted as superiors by respectful salutations in public places. <span class="cmt_word">To be called Rabbi, Rabbi; "</span>My Master" (compare the French <span class="accented">Monsieur</span>, used not only vocatively, but absolutely); the term addressed by scholars to their teacher, and repeated for ostentation's sake, of course implying superiority in those thus called. Christ himself was thus addressed by those who desired to denote his authority and preeminence (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16, 24, 36</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>). These greetings and salutations were enjoined on scholars and inferiors, under pain of ecclesiastical censure and loss of salvation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, <i>even</i> Christ; and all ye are brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not ye called Rabbi.</span> After stating the customs of the Pharisees, Christ proceeds (vers. 8-12) to give his own  disciples a lesson in humility. The pronoun is emphatic, "But ye, be not ye called." They are not to be eager for such distinctions, indicative of spiritual superiority. The prohibition must be understood in the spirit, and not in the letter (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). Our Lord does not forbid respect for teachers or different grades in his Church (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>); that which he censures is the inordinate grasping at such personal distinctions, the greedy ambition which loves the empty title, and takes any means to obtain it. <span class="cmt_word">One is your Master, even Christ.</span> The received text gives <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Many good manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Teacher</span> (so Revised Version) instead of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Leader</span>, [and omit <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Both these variations seem reasonable and warranted. "Leader" has probably been introduced from ver. 10, where it occurs naturally; it is out of place here, where, for the sake of concinnity, "Teacher" is required in both parts of the sentence. And it is unlikely that Jesus should here expressly mention himself. He is speaking now of their heavenly Father; to himself he refers in ver. 10. In support of the allusion to the Father, Bengel cites <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, etc. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Unus est enim Magister vester</span>; and yet Roman Catholic commentators interpret the clause of Christ, in spite of the purposed indefiniteness of the expression. Jesus points to the inspiration of the Father or the Holy Spirit as that which teaches his disciples. They were to follow no earthly rabbi, but the heavenly Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">All ye are brethren.</span> And therefore, so far, equal. They were disciples of our Lord, and to them appertained equality and fraternity.

In ver. 8 Christ said, "be not called;" here he uses the active, "call not," as if he would intimate that his followers must not give this honoured title to any doctor out of complaisance, or flattery, or affectation. Upon the earth. In contradistinction to heaven, where our true Father dwells. They were to follow no earthly school. They had natural lathers and spiritual fathers, but the authority of all comes from God; it is delegated, not essential; and good teachers would make men look to God, and not to themselves, as the source of power and truth.

"What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>). How mournful to think that Christ's great prayer for unity (<a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) is still unfulfilled, frustrated or delayed by man's self-will!

The antithesis certainly requires it. The gnome, so often repeated (see references), seems to be, as it has been called, "an axiom in the kingdom of God." It is indeed a universal law in God's dealings with men. Olshausen quotes a saying! of Hillel to the same purport, "My humility is my exaltation, and my exaltation is my humility." The first clause was prophetic of the speedy overthrow of the haughty Pharisees; the second is grandly illustrated in the example of Christ, who humbled himself to the death of the cross, and is now highly exalted; who "for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). St. Peter draws the lesson, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5, 6</a>).

As Christ inaugurated his public teaching by pronouncing eight benedictions in the sermon on the mount, so here he closes his ministry by imprecating or prophesying eight woes on the perverse and unbelieving Pharisees. In Lange's commentary there is proposed a scheme of antithesis between the  benedictions and the woes, but it is not very successful, being often forced and unnatural; and it is better to regard the contrast in a general view, and not to attempt to press it in particulars. Jesus here pours forth his righteous anger on those whose obstinate infidelity was about to bring ruin on the Jewish city and nation. <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto you!</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). These terrible "woes" are not only evoked by indignation, and pronounced as a solemn judgment, they are also expressive of the profoundest pity, and are prophetic of the future. They have, indeed, a twofold reference - they refer first to temporal judgments and visitations, now ready to fall; and secondly to the retribution in the eternal world. That the meek and lowly Jesus should utter such awful denunciations shows how greatly he was moved how he left nothing untried to turn these hard hearts to introspection and repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Scribes</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Pharisees</span> (see on ver. 2), <span class="cmt_word">hypocrites</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>). Christ uses this word seven times in these denunciations. It is applied to the Pharisees as deceiving themselves and others, under the mask of godliness hiding polluted hearts, persuading themselves that formal externalism was real piety and devotion, and practically teaching this fatal delusion. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">before men</span>; <span class="accented">ante homines</span> (Vulgate.

There was many a time when 34, people were ready to acknowledge Christ and to follow him as Messiah. A word from their authorized leaders would have turned the scale in his favour; but that word was never spoken. The weight of authority was always placed on the opposite side, and naught but prejudice, animosity, and slander befell the cause of Jesus.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Septuagint to signify "a stranger" or "sojourner" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>, etc.), and at this time was applied to a convert to Judaism (<a href="../../par/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>), whether circumcised, "a proselyte of righteousness;" or uncircumcised, "a proselyte of the gate." To <span class="accented">compass sea and land</span> is a proverbial expression, denoting the employment of every means, the exercise of the utmost effort. One might have thought that, in its proud isolation and exclusiveness, Judaism would not have exposed itself to this reproach. But what says Josephus? In more than one passage of his histories he testifies to the zealous propagation of the  Jewish religion, and in some cases the enforcement of circumcision on vanquished enemies (see 'Ant.,' 18:03. 5; 20:2. 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 10; 'Vita,' &sect; 23). Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:5) gives a most unfavourable account of the numerous converts which Hebrews made throughout the Roman provinces; and St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 6:11) quotes Seneca saying, "Cum interim usque eo sceleratissimae gentis consuetudo convaluit, ut per omnes jam terras recepta sit, victi victoribus leges dederunt" (Edersheim). For similar testimony, we may refer to Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:4. 142, 143; and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:541, etc. But it was not proselytizing in itself that the Lord censured. As possessing revelation and the only true religion in the world, the Jews might well have deemed it their business to enlighten the gross darkness of heathenism, and to endeavour to shed abroad the pure light which was confided to their care to tend and cherish. That they were not expressly commanded to do this, and that little blessing attended their efforts in this direction, was dependent upon the transitory and imperfect character of the old covenant, and the many evils which would be consequent upon association with alien peoples. In making converts, the Pharisees sought rather to secure outward conformity than inward piety, change of external religion than change of heart. There was no love of souls, no burning zeal for the honour of God, in their proselytism. They were prompted only by selfish and base motives - vain glory, party spirit, covetousness; and if they converted men to their own opinions, with their false tenets, gross externalism, and practical immorality, they had far better have left them in their irresponsible ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">When he is made;</span> <span class="accented">when he is become</span> a proselyte. <span class="cmt_word">Twofold more the child of hell;</span> <span class="accented">a son of Gehenna</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthy of hell fire.

The converts became doubly the children of hell because, seeing the iniquities of their teachers, they learned an evil lesson from them, "engrafted the vices of the Jews on the vices of the heathen," distrusted all goodness, discarded their old religion and disbelieved the new, making utter shipwreck of their moral life. "Ita natura comparati sumus," says an old commentator, "ut vitia potius quam virtutes imitemur, et in rebus malis a discipulis magistri facile superentur."

They were by profession leaders and guides, and yet by their literalism and externalism they lost the true significance of the Scriptures which they taught, and the ritual of which they were the exponents.

An oath by the temple was not binding; it might be broken or evaded with impunity. <span class="cmt_word">By the gold of the temple -</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the sacred treasure and ornaments therein - <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); he is bound by his oath.

It was because the temple was the place of God's presence that what was therein was consecrated. The gold was nothing without the temple; the temple, the originally holy, is superior to the gold, the derivatively holy, and an oath that calls the temple to witness is surely obligatory.

This, too, opened up large opportunities of evasion.

From such passages we learn that God sanctifies things and places to be devoted to his service, and to be accounted by men holy and separated from all common uses.

Christ again dissipates such sophistries. To swear by the creature is virtually to swear by the Creator. A brute, inanimate thing cannot be witness to an oath; he alone can be appealed to who owns all. Thus we "kiss the book," calling God to witness our words. Christ had already given a lesson to his followers on this subject in the sermon on the mount (ch. Matthew 5:34-37). He inculcates true reverence, that fear and awe of God's dignity and God's presence which constrains a man to avoid all profaneness and carelessness in regard to things that are concerned with God.

"Mint" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Of this well known plant several species grow in Palestine; it was one of the ingredients of the sauce of bitter herbs eaten at the Paschal feast (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), and was hung up in the synagogue for its fragrance. "Anise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is known to us as "dill," and is much used in medicine and for seasoning.

Christ seems to refer to the words of <a href="../../par/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (see also <a href="../../par/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9, 10</a>). Worthless are all outward observances when the moral precepts are neglected. "Judgment" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means acting equitably to one's neighbour, hurting nobody by word or deed; as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a> a man is sought "that exerciseth justice.'" Such impartiality is specially enjoined in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, etc.). "Mercy," loving kindness in conduct, often taught in the Pentateuch, as in the case of the widow, the stranger, and the debtor, and very different from the feeling of those who "devour widows' houses." "Faith" may mean fidelity to promises: "He that sweareth unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance" (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>); but it is more probably taken as that belief in God without which it is not possible to please him, and which should underlie and influence all moral action (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)...  <span class="cmt_word">the other</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). "These last" are judgment, mercy, and faith; these it was your duty to have done. "The other" refers to the tithing mentioned above. Christ does not censure this attention to minutiae. He would teach conformity to regulations made by competent authority, or conscientiously felt to be binding, even though not distinctly enjoined in Scripture (see vers. 2, 3); his blame is reserved for that expenditure of zeal on trifles which stood in the place of, or left no strength for, higher duties. It was a very elastic conscience which tithed a pot herb and neglected judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Strain at a gnat;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. "At" is supposed to be a misprint for "out." Thus Revised Version, and early English versions, <span class="accented">which strain out the gnat</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">excolantes culicem.</span> Alford thinks the present reading was an intentional alteration, meaning "strain (out the wine) at (the occurrence of) a gnat" - which seems more ingenious than probable. If "at" be retained, it  must be taken as expressive of the fastidiousness which had to make a strong effort to overcome its distaste at this little insect. The wine, before drinking, was carefully strained through linen (see <a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, "strained wine," Septuagint) to avoid the accidental violation of <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20, 23</a>, etc.; Leviticus 17:10-14, by swallowing an unclean insect.

But the Pharisees' motives in acting thus were not pure; they were not influenced by respect for the prophets or repentance for national sins, but by pride, hypocrisy, and self-sufficiency.

Commentators quote the old adage, herein exemplified, "Sit licet divus, dummodo non vivus."

Christ is the Wisdom of God, and by his own authority gives mission to his messengers.

The passage in the Second (Fourth) Book of Esdras 1:32, which is strikingly parallel to our Lord's denunciation, may possibly be a Christian interpolation, "I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a></div><div class="verse">That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That upon you may come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>). This phrase does not express a simple consequence, neither can it mean "in such a way that" - explanations which have been given by some commentators to avoid a seeming difficulty in the final sense; but it is to be translated, as usually, <span class="accented">in order that, ut veniat.</span> God, foreseeing the issues of their evil heart, puts in their way occasions which will aid his vengeance and accelerate the time of their punishment. He lets them work out their own destruction by committing an unpardonable sin. He does not force them into this course of conduct; they can resist the opportunity if they will; but he knows they will not do so, and the  visitation becomes judgment. To have a man's blood upon one's head is to be held guilty of the crime of murder, and to be liable to make the required atonement for it. So in their blind fury, taking the punishment on themselves, the Jews a little later cried, "His blood been us, and on our children!" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteous blood</span>. So in the Old Testament we often find such expressions as "innocent blood" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>); "blood of the just" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a>); comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> and Revelation 18:24, where it is written that in Babylon "was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all them that were slain upon the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Righteous Abel.</span> The first of the murdered, the prototype of the death of Christ and of all good men who have died for truth, religion, and justice (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>). The catalogue of such is long and terrible. Our Lord assigns a period to its dimensions, commencing with the first death mentioned in the Bible, and ending with the murder of <span class="cmt_word">Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">the sanctuary</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and the altar.</span> Our Lord is speaking of a past event well known to his hearers; but who this Zacharias was is much disputed. Origen mentions a tradition, otherwise entirely unsupported, that Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, was the son of Barachiah, and was murdered in the temple. But the story looks as if it was made to relieve the difficulty of identification; neither, as far as we know, was he a prophet. Zechariah, the minor prophet, was the son of Berechiah; but we read nothing of his being slain in the temple or elsewhere. It is true that Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:05. 4) tells how a "Zacharias, son of Baruch," an honourable man, was slain by the zealots in the temple. But this murder took place A.D. , and our Lord could not number it among past crimes, or speak of it as an event familiar to those who heard him. The only other prophet of this name in the Bible is one mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>, as stoned by the people at the command of Joash, in the court of the house of the Lord. "And when he died," it is added, "he said, The Lord look upon it, and require it." This makes his case correspond to that of Abel, the voice of whose blood cried unto God from the ground. He is also the last prophet whose death is recorded in the Old Testament, and the guilt of whose murder, the Jews say, was not purged till the temple was burned under Nebuchadnezzar. It seems to be a kind of proverbial saying which the Lord here uses, equivalent to "from the first murdered saint to the last," taking the arrangement of the Hebrew canon of Scripture, and regarding the Books of Chronicles as the conclusion of Jewish history. This (though it would exclude the murder of other prophets, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) would all be plain enough and quite appropriate to the context were it not that the Zechariah thus referred to was the son of Jehoiada, not of Barachias. But there are two solutions of this difficulty suggested; and, allowing either of these, we may confidently assert that the above-named prophet is the personage intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The words, "son of Barachias" may be an early interpolation, introduced by a copyist who was thinking of the minor prophet. They are omitted by the first correcter of the Sinaitic Manuscript, are not found in the parallel passage of St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>), and Jerome remarks that in the 'Gospel of the Nazarenes' was read "son of Joiada." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There may have been family reasons, unknown to us, why Zechariah was thus designated (see the commentators on our Lord's genealogy in St. <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, especially on ver. 23, "son of Hell," ver. 27, "son of Salathiel," and ver. 36, "son of Cainan"). Or Jehoiada may have had two names, as so many Jews had. Indeed, the two appellations are not altogether dissimilar in meaning, <span class="accented">Jehoiada</span> signifying "Jehovah knoweth," and <span class="accented">Barachiah</span>, "Jehovah blesseth." Or again, Barachiah may have been the father of Zechariah, and Jehoiada the more famous grandfather. It has been suggested (by Morison, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that one of the monuments recently erected in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem was dedicated to Zacharias. Such a one still bears his name. Hence Christ's allusion is very natural after his statement in ver. 29. The scene of the murder was the open space in the priests' court, between the holy place and the great altar of sacrifice. The sanctity of this spot made the crime abnormally atrocious.

The blood of the past was required from the Jews of the present time, because they and their evil ancestors were of one family, and were to be dealt with as a whole. In spite of the teaching of history and example, in spite of the warnings of Christ and his apostles, they were bent on repeating the acts of their forefathers, and that in an aggravated form and against increased light and knowledge.

The word is omitted by some few uncials, but retained by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, D, etc., most cursives, the Vulgate, etc. The protecting wing is withdrawn, the Divine presence removed, and the house is indeed deserted (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); (comp. Psalm 59:25; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/23-39.htm">Matthew 23:39</a></div><div class="verse">For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not see me henceforth.</span> Christ explains the denunciation just given. In a few days he will be separated from them by death and burial; and, though he appeared to certain chosen witnesses after his resurrection, he was seen no more by the people (<a href="../../par/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>); their house was deserted. Some take the word "see" in the sense of know, recognize; but it seems rather weak to say, "Ye shall not know me till ye acknowledge me as Messiah," as the knowing and acknowledging are practically identical or simultaneous. <span class="cmt_word">Till ye shall say,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!</span> The words which had greeted his triumphal entry a few days before (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>). The clause, "till ye shall say," does not shut the door of hope forever; it looks forward to a happier prospect. The time intended is that when Israel shall repent of its rejection of the Messiah, and in bitter contrition look on him whom it pierced, owning and receiving Jesus with glad "Hosannahs!" Then shall they behold him coming in power and glory, and shall regain their old position as beloved of God (see <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). Then "all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). Thus this terrible chapter, so dark and menacing, closes with a glow of hope and a promise, indefinite but certain, of final restoration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 22"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 24"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
