Not the proper name, but the official title (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-16.htm">Matthew 1:16, 17</a>, notes). The title may be merely due to the evangelist's narrative, or may represent the actual terms in which the message was brought to John. It brings out the pathos of the situation. John had prepared the way of the Christ, and had at the baptism taken part in his anointing. Yet of all the works that the Christ now did there was none to set his kinsman and herald free. <span class="cmt_word">He sent two of his</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples</span>; <span class="accented">by his disciples</span> (Revised Version). Possibly the slight difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>, the true reading here, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>, which is genuine in Luke, points to the common source (observe here a Greek source) having been written, but with the close similarity in sound this need not have been the case. Observe that the true reading lays slightly more emphasis on the fact of the inquiry coming from John himself (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). "Sent by" is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-13.htm">Exodus 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>).

The question was brought from John; the answer is sent back to him (ver. 4). This points to the cause of the question lying ultimately, not with his disciples, but with himself. Although John might justly fear that they would follow him rather than Jesus (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>, note), yet he seems to have made this inquiry for his own sake. He who stood on the Jewish side of the threshold of the kingdom (ver. 11) did not understand the methods by which the King was acting, and thus his faith was tried (comp. Tertullian, 'Adv. Marc.,' 4:18). In this he recalls his great prototype, whose plans seemed to have failed and his boldness to have done no good (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 14</a>). To both the answer implied that success was assured to quiet spiritual work. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">he that should come?</span> he <span class="accented">that cometh</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>, note). The title was probably derived from <a href="../../par/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, and would become the more known from the LXX. of <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>), and perhaps also from a directly Messianic interpretation of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or do we look for</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) contains no thought of looking about for, but only of earnest expectation. <span class="cmt_word">Another?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and so in <a href="../../par/luke/7-19.htm">Luke 7:19</a>; but <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/luke/7-20.htm">Luke 7:20</a> (where, however, Westcott and Heft margin reads <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Observe that in both records the evangelist's own summary of John's message speaks of a difference in kind, but that in the form given by the messengers (<a href="../../par/luke/7-20.htm">Luke 7:20</a>) it is only a matter of a second person coming (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 15:39, etc.). John's disciples, that is to say, are represented as failing to catch the point of their master's question whether he must look, after all, for a Messiah who acts differently from the way in which Jesus acts.

He makes no verbal self-defence, but appeals to the effects of his work.

Cheyne, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, 'Critical Note'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our Lord reverses the order of the expressions, taking the restoration of sight to the blind as the commencement of a series of physical miracles, and thus making spiritual work the climax. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He does not quote Isaiah's phrase, "liberty to the captives," although the quotation of its context could not but suggest it to John, the reason being, it would seem, that he desired to call John's attention away from the more political part of Messiah's work to that which alone forms the basis of permanent political improvement - the restoration of the individual. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> In accordance with this is the fact that when he was laying stress on the character of his adherents as the one qualification for sharing in his kingdom, he alluded to the same passage of Isaiah (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-5</a>). John was not wholly emancipated from the Jewish tendency to regard the external results of the kingdom; our Lord's mind dwelt rather on the internal results. Although John's difficulty had been felt when he heard of the works (ver. 2, note), our Lord only said in reply, "Tell him of my works." It was an old message, and yet a new one. In the nature of those works, when fully understood, lay the true solution of his difficulty. Observe that here also Christ adds a Beatitude (ver. 6). <span class="accented">The blind</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>, note), (<span class="accented">and the lame.</span> The "and" is doubtless genuine here, its omission in some manuscripts being due to the parallel passage in Luke.

Fulfilling his command (ver. 4). It' we may combine the language of St. Matthew and St. Luke ("when the messengers of John were departed"), we may say that they had left the circle immediately round our Lord, but were hardly further than the outskirts of the crowd. <span class="cmt_word">What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</span> <span class="accented">to behold</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,). It almost suggests that they went out as though to see a spectacle. They were stirred by no deeper motive. Bengel compares <a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A reed shaken with the wind?</span> If the reed referred to by our Lord was the papyrus, which still grows freely in certain parts of the Jordan valley, the description of this plant in 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' ch. 17, is specially interesting: "There is first a lateral trunk, lying on the water and half-submerged. This is sometimes as thick as a man's body, and from its lower side hang innumerable string-like roots from three to five feet long, and of a deep purple colour .... These pendent roots...  retard much of the surface-current where the papyrus grows On the upper surface of the trunks the stems grow alternately in oblique rows;, their thickness at the junction is often four inches, and their height fifteen feet, gracefully tapering until at the top is a little round knob, with long, thin brown, wire-like hairs eighteen inches long, which rise and then, recurving, hang about it in a thyrsus-shaped head." He also says, "The whole jungle of papyrus was <span class="accented">floating upon the water</span>, and so the waves raised by the breeze were rocking the green curtain to and fro." This explained "a most curious hissing, grinding, bustling sound, that was heard like waves upon a shingly beach," as "the papyrus stems were rubbing against each other as they nodded out and in." It is, however, much more probable that the reed referred to was "the <span class="accented">Arundo donax</span>, a very tall cane, growing twelve feet high, with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It grows especially on the western  side of the Dead Sea (cf. Tristram, 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 4,37, edit. 1889). To our Lord's question no answer was needed. John had rejected the overtures of the nationalists (<a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19-21</a>), and had not feared to rebuke a king (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-4.htm">Matthew 14:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/11-8.htm">Matthew 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">But what went ye out for to see?

Menahem the Essene was by the wish of Herod the Great made deputy to Hillel in the Sanhedrin, but afterwards left his office. "Whither did he go out? Abai said. He went out to destruction. Rabba said, He went out for the service of the king. There is also a Baraitha [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> an 'uncanonical' Mishna] to this effect, that Menahem went out for the service of the king, and there went out with him eighty pairs of disciples clothed in Syrian robes" (Talm. Bab., 'Chagigah,' 16b, edit. Streane). It has been conjectured, though hardly on sufficient evidence, that our Lord was thinking of this case; but the Talmudic passage at least illustrates the gorgeousness of the apparel of the courtiers, and suggests the luxury of living that St. Luke speaks of ("They which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts"). It is, however, only fair to Menahem to say that Gratz ('Geschichte der Judaer,' 3. p. 230, edit. 1877) is able to suppose that he merely went back again to his solitude.

He thus passes on to show the relation in which John stood to himself. John was more than a prophet such as they thought of, for he was "the subject as well as the vehicle of prophecy" (Alford), and was the immediate forerunner of the great King. <span class="accented">More than</span>; <span class="accented">much more than</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;</span> is probably neuter, for this not only agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, but emphasizes the thought more than the masculine (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>, note).

Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-27.htm">Luke 7:27</a>), save for the omission of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>, is the same; Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>) only omits <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span> and "before thee." Christ does not hesitate to apply to himself a prophecy of the coming of God, nor did the early Church shrink from recording this of him. Such an application of an Old Testament passage Bengel calls "luclentissimum argumentum Deitatis Christi." (On this subject, cf. Bishop Westcott, Add. Note on <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>.)

This seems almost less praise than ver. 9.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a></div><div class="verse">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - It is curious that in St. Luke's account of this speech of our Lord's he should omit our vers. 12-14 (on ver. 15, see note there), thus leaving out all Christ's plainer and more direct teaching about the relation of John to himself. St. Luke places (<a href="../../par/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>) our vers. 12 and 13 in what appears to be merely a cento of sayings. Possibly the original occasion has been recorded by neither evangelist, but in Matthew the passage certainly brings out the thought upon which our Lord was insisting on this occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. Slightly adversative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>), for there is a change of subject. Christ urges his hearers to more definitely range themselves under his banner. <span class="cmt_word">From the days of John the Baptist until now</span>. Yet this was not more than a few months! Possibly the sentence had become modified in oral teaching, so as to include many years, say up to A.D.  or 60. St. Luke's <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is easy enough. Observe the implied success of John's work as herald. He so prepared the way that men were eager to enter the kingdom which  he had said was at hand. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven</span>. The realm ruled over by Messiah, of which the then community of believers was the earnest (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 25.). <span class="cmt_word">Suffereth violence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In Luke it is middle, "Every man entereth violently into it;" and though it is certainly passive here, St. Luke's phrase compels us to understand the reason of the violence to be entrance into the kingdom. The kingdom is not ill treated, but it is as it were taken by storm (Meyer). Nosgen strangely understands the phrase to mean that the kingdom is set forward with power, and he would apparently see in "the violent" a special reference to our Lord and John. <span class="cmt_word">And the violent</span>; <span class="accented">and men of violence</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>: only they; men whose mind is made up and who care not what force and power they employ to attain their object. <span class="cmt_word">Take it by force</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "grasp it for themselves," like rough and violent bandits seizing their prey. Weiss sees in this verse blame of the politico-Messianic endeavours to hasten the completion of the kingdom. This explanation is good in itself (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>), but disconnects the verse from its context. Our Lord is describing the energy with which some souls are pressing in, and urging the need of such energy if salvation is to be obtained.

In Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>) the Law is mentioned first, because the context is there dealing chiefly with the Law. Here our Lord has said that John was more than a prophet, and he naturally continues to speak of prophets first.

It can hardly point also to a yet future coming of the prophet. But compare Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>, and Schurer, II. 2:156.

And <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> thus gives au excellent sense. Our Lord says that the Divine Wisdom is justified in the minds of men from the results she brings about. Of what is he thinking? Doubtless moral results, and probably those found in the change that might be seen in the publicans and sinners of which he has just been speaking. The Divine Wisdom, which appeared to the careless and unsympathetic so strange and changeable in her methods, is, notwithstanding, pronounced to be in the right, because of the results of her activity, the men and the women brought under her influence. These <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>) are always the best justification of misunderstood plans. While, however, this seems the best interpretation of the sentence as recorded in Matthew, it must be confessed that in Luke it appears more natural to understand "her children" as those who justify her; and further, this was probably St. Luke's own interpretation. For he seems to purposely give an explanation of the apothegm in the verses (<a href="../../par/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29, 30</a>) by which he joins the equivalent of our vers. 16-19 to the equivalent of our ver. 11. He there tells us that all the people and the publicans "justified God," having been baptized with the baptism of John, but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's plan towards them, not having been baptized by him. Wisdom's children justified her; others did not. Anyhow, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would appear to be the more original of the two terms, for with the explanation preferred above, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would be very easily derived from it.

We know no other occasion which would be so likely to evoke this utterance. Although it is just possible that the seventy returned when our Lord was addressing the people in the manner related in the preceding verses of this chapter, it seems much more likely that a sense of a moral and not of a temporal connexion guided St. Matthew in his arrangement. What is true in a time of success (<a href="../../par/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>) is equally true in a time of failure (vers. 20-24). Observe the difference in the style of ver. 27 (<a href="../../par/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>) from that of vers. 25, 26, suggesting the use of another, apparently Johannine, source. But this must have been added before either St. Matthew or St. Luke incorporated the passage. Observe that the comparatively  early date thus indicated for Johannine phraseology suggests that the language and form of the Fourth Gospel underwent a long process of development before St. John completed his work. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>; <span class="accented">season</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. St. Luke's phrase ("in that very hour," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>) is more precise, definitely connecting the utterance with the return of the seventy. St. Matthew's refers rather to that stage or period in his ministry (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span>. Only in Matthew. If we could suppose this to be the original context of the passage, the" answer" would probably refer to some expression of astonishment or complaint at his solemn statement in vers. 20-24. Professor Marshall's derivation of both "answered" and "rejoiced" (Luke) from a common Aramaic original (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891) appears very strained. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I thank thee</span>; better, as the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">praise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). There is no thought of gratitude, but of publicity in assent (<a href="../../par/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>), in confession (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) and in acknowledgment (<a href="../../par/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>), and thus of praise (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a> (Lucian); <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It implies a profession of personal acceptance by Christ of God's methods. "I profess to thee my entire and joyful acquiescence in what thou doest." Hence St. Luke introduces the utterance by <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, adding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, thus giving us a glimpse of the unity of purpose and feeling inherent in the Trinity, even during the time that the Word "tabernacled among us." <span class="cmt_word">O Father</span>. <span class="accented">Father</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>; in fact, in all the recorded prayers of our Lord except <a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, which is a quotation, and where the phrase, "My God, my God," emphasizes his sense of desolation. The word expresses perfect relationship and intimate communion. It points to the trust, the love, and the obedience of Christ, and to the depth of natural affection and confidence (if we may say so) between him and the First Person of the Trinity. It suggests mercies in the past, care in the present, and provision for the future. <span class="cmt_word">Lord of heaven and earth</span>. <a href="../../par/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a>, by St. Paul, who may have derived it from these words of our Lord (Resch, ' Agmpha,' p. 150), or perhaps from <a href="../../par/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a> or <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>. As "Father" was the note of personal relationship, so is this of sovereign majesty. Christ unites the thought of God's love to himself with that of his ownership of all creation, thus paving the way for the main subject of the prayer - his Father's method of dealing with men of various kinds and tempers. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>; <span class="accented">that</span> (Revised Version), perhaps as more idiomatic with "thank."

(For the general truth, cf. <a href="../../par/job/37-24.htm">Job 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-27</a>.) <span class="accented">And hast revealed them</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>, note); for even the most guileless heart has no power to see spiritual truths unless God draws back the veil. <span class="accented">Unto babes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>).

The phrase implies, not merely that it seemed good to God, but that, in a sense, it was his pleasure. For the workings out of the laws of truth must give pleasure to the <span class="cmt_word"></span> God of truth. (On the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, see ver. 25, note.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Matthew 11:27 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">things.</span> Not in the widest sense, for this would forestall ch. 28:18 but all things that are required for my work <span class="cmt_word">of</span> manifesting the truth. The utterance is thus both closely parallel to <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>, and also in most intimate connexion with the preceding verses. God's twofold action in hiding the truth from some and revealing it to others is, our Lord says, all of a piece with my whole work. This is all arranged by my Father, and the knowledge of God by any man is no chance matter. <span class="cmt_word">Are</span> <span class="cmt_word">delivered unto me;</span> <span class="accented">have been delivered</span> (Revised Version); rather, <span class="accented">were delivered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Here also it is possible to interpret the aorist from the standpoint of the hereafter (ver. 25, note); but, as it is immediately followed by the present tense, it more probably refers to some time earlier than that at which our Lord was speaking. The time of his entrance on the world naturally suggests itself. Observe when bringing out his dependence upon his Father, our Lord lays stress on the notion of transmission (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); but in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where he is bringing out his post-resurrection greatness (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>), he merely mentions his authority as an absolute gift (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Notice the contrast implied in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> to the Jewish <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.

For the transmission was immediate; there were no links between the Giver and the Receiver (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My Father</span>; me...  my. Observe the double claim; his unique position as Teacher is due to his unique relation by nature. <span class="cmt_word">And no man knoweth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a gradual, but at last complete, perception (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). In the Gospels this word is used of the knowledge of God and of Christ in this verse alone, though such a reference is especially suited to its meaning of perfection of know. ledge (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Son</span>. Not "me," because Christ wished <span class="cmt_word">to</span> bring out more clearly his unique relation to God, and thus to emphasize the impossibility of any one, even an advanced disciple, fully knowing him. <span class="cmt_word">But the Father</span>. Not "his Father." It may be that Christ wishes to include the suggestion that after all there is a sense in which his Father is the Father of all men, but more probably, by making <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> completely parallel to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, he wishes to suggest that the full idea of Sonship and Fatherhood is nowhere else so fully satisfied. <span class="cmt_word">Neither knoweth any man</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, save the Son, and</span> he <span class="cmt_word">to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</span> The connexion is - You may think this (<span class="accented">i.e. ver.</span> 25) strange, but I alone have that knowledge of God which enables me to understand his ways; I alone, yet others also, if I reveal him to them. As St. Luke expressed it in his form of our ver. 19, "Wisdom is justified of her children" (comp. also <a href="../../par/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">To whomsoever.</span> Though but a babe (ver. 25). <span class="accented">Will reveal</span>; <span class="accented">willeth to reveal</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Not "is commanded," for Christ claims equality (see Chrysostom). Notice the idea of plan and deliberation, and not that of mere desire, unable, perhaps, to assign a reason for its existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>.

Our Lord purposely did not define in what the toil and burden consisted; for he would include all, from whatever quarter their toil and burden came. But since the spiritual is the central part of man (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note), the more that the toil or burden is felt there so much the stronger would our Lord's reference to it be. He would therefore be inviting most especially those that toil in legal ways of righteousness (<a href="../../par/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2, 3</a>), and are burdened under Pharisaic enactments (<a href="../../par/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I.</span> Emphatic (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>).

In confortuity with this we find <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> regularly used in the LXX. as a translation of <span class="accented">sabbathon</span> ("sabbath-keeping," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, for which <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> comes in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a> as an equivalent). The thought, therefore, here is not that those who come  to Christ will have no more work, but that Christ will give them at once such rest and refreshment of soul that they may be fit for work, should God have any in store for them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a></div><div class="verse">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Vers. 29, 30 have so much in common with both the language and the thought of Ecclus. 51:26, 27, that probably this passage was in our Lord's mind. It is noteworthy that most of the other signs of acquaintance with Ecclesiasticus are found in the Epistle of St. James (cf. Edersheim, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on Ecclesiasticus, p. 22). <span class="cmt_word">Take my</span> <span class="cmt_word">yoke upon you</span>. For there is work to be done, therefore enter on it. The yoke is the service that Christ gives us to do, and therefore implies more than his teaching. This, however, is so important a part of his service, both in itself and as being the means of knowing what he wishes done, that Christ speaks of it as though almost identical with his yoke. (On the figure of the yoke, compare a note by Professor Ryle and Mr. James, in 'Psalms of Solomon,' 7:8, suggesting that our Lord was contrasting his yoke with the yoke of minute legal observance laid upon the people by the scribes and Pharisees. For a detailed description of the yoke and plough used now in Palestine, see an article by Dr. Post in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration for 1891, p. 112.) <span class="cmt_word">And learn of me</span>. The figure of the oxen passes into that of the scholars. The "of" is slightly ambiguous, and may refer to Christ as the Example from which they may draw the lesson for themselves (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>), or as the Teacher who will himself instruct them (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>). The second meaning is more suitable here. (For the thought, comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The reason why they should learn from him and no other teacher. He alone was what he claimed to teach, therefore he alone could teach it properly, and therefore from him alone could they learn that type of character which they ought to develop. <span class="cmt_word">I am</span>. Observe the claim. It is almost greater than that of ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Meek</span>. Primarily, as regards God (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, note). Receiving in my degree whatever yoke my Father puts on me. <span class="cmt_word">And lowly in heart</span>. As regards men. Observe that <span class="accented">meek</span> and <span class="accented">lowly</span> correspond, though the order is reversed, to "He humbled himself and became obedient" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to the Incarnation (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), but to his relation to others in this world). <span class="accented">In heart</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, note). "Lowly in heart" very nearly corresponds to "he that is of a lowly spirit." Such a person as Christ's experience shows (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) "shall obtain honour" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall find rest unto your souls</span>. In this learning and service. The words are taken from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a> (not the LXX.; cf. also Ecclus. 6:28), where they form the promise given to those that ask for the old paths and walk in the good way of the Divine commandments. But these roads were now more clearly made known in Christ. Observe the full force of the two expressions, <span class="accented">I will give you rest</span> (ver. 28), and <span class="accented">Ye shall find rest.</span> The tired comers are at once refreshed by Christ; these accept his service and teaching, and in performing it find further rest. The first rest may be termed the peace of justification; the second, <span class="accented">that</span> of sanctification. Both are obtained through Christ alone, yet they are not to be confused, much less identified, with one another.
