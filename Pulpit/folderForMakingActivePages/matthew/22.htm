This fact may account for its exhibiting certain merciful and gracious features, setting forth the privilege rather than the duty of obeying the gospel call. The term "answered" often does not signify a reply given to some distinct question, but is equivalent to "took occasion to observe" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, etc.). Here the occasion was the insidious schemes of his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Again</span>. With reference to the two parables in the preceding chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Parables</span>. The plural denotes the class to which the discourse belongs; or it may refer to the many parabolic details contained herein. Only one parable follows. This bears great resemblance to the parable of the great supper (<a href="../../par/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>.), which, however, was spoken at an earlier period, in another locality, and with a different object, and disagrees in many details, especially in the absence of the wedding garment. Christ, doubtless, often repeated his parables with variations in particulars to suit time, audiences, and circumstances.

This parable supplements that of the wicked husbandmen. As that referred to Jewish times, so this refers to gospel times. The householder in the one becomes the king in the other; one demands work and duty, the other bestows gifts and blessings; one is angered at ingratitude for favours received, the other punishes for contempt of offered bounty. <span class="cmt_word">A certain king;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>: <span class="accented">a man a king</span>, even God the Father, the expression denoting "the Almighty's wonderful condescension, as assimilating himself to our infirmities in his dispensations towards us" (I.

Morison compares our English word "nuptials."

Their reasons for refusal are not given here - a fact which differentiates this parable from that of the great supper. A general disinclination or aversion is denoted; no actual outrage is perpetrated as yet, but the invited guests are ripening for this stage, in that they despise the King's Son, and believe not in his Divine mission. This backwardness and obduracy recall Christ's lamentation, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" (<a href="../../par/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34, 35</a>).

We may compare the invitation of Wisdom in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>, etc.) with this of Christ. In Jewish minds the blessings of Messiah's kingdom are constantly connected with the idea of a sumptuous feast, as in <a href="../../par/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15</a>; and our Lord himself uses the same image (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>).

These are simply careless, indifferent scorners, who are too busy with their worldly concerns to attend to the claims of the gospel. So we read, "The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His farm;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">his own farm</span>, or estate.

They are actively hostile to the King and his messengers, rejecting them not merely for worldly or interested motives, but from intense hatred to the doctrines which they taught. Such were the scribes and Pharisees, who could not endure to see the Law superseded, and the Gentiles raised to their level; such were the Sadducees, who scoffed at a faith founded on the resurrection, and refused credit to the miraculous with which the gospel was interwoven. <span class="cmt_word">Took his servants.</span> The narratives in the Acts give many instances of the seizure and imprisonment of apostles and believers (see <a href="../../par/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Entreated</span> (<span class="accented">treated</span>) them <span class="cmt_word">spitefully</span> (see <a href="../../par/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Slew</span> them; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>), James (<a href="../../par/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a></div><div class="verse">But when the king heard <i>thereof</i>, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the king heard</span> thereof. The text varies here. Some manuscripts have "that king," to whom the rejection of his messengers was a personal insult (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>, etc.). The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other authorities omit <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "heard thereof," and it may well be a gloss from the human view that the king, not being personally present, must have been informed of the incidents.

Probably both angels and men are included in the term. <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed...  burned up their city.</span> No longer his city, but theirs, the  murderers' city, Jerusalem. So a little later foretelling the same fate, Jesus speaks of "your house" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>). The Romans, in fact, some forty years after, put to the sword the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and burned the city to ashes.

This general evangelization was begun in apostolic times (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5, 38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28, 48</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>), and has been carried on ever since. The apostles' special ministrations to the Jews seemed to have ended at the martyrdom of St. James the Less, A.D. 62 (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:09, l). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Highways;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">the roads.</span> Not "the partings of the ways," whither they had been ordered to go.

The bad are named first, in order to show the infinite graciousness of the king. In the earliest times converts were baptized with very little preparation and without any probation, as we see in the case of the eunuch, the jailor, and many more mentioned in the Acts; and doubtless many were insincere and soon lapsed. When we read of whole households being baptized, and in later times of whole nations receiving Christian initiation, there must have been little individual preparation of heart or cleansing of conscience, and the missioner had to take for granted much which more careful examination would have proved to be fallacious. The mention of this mixture of bad and good in the company introduces the final scene. <span class="cmt_word">The wedding.</span> The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other manuscripts read "marriage chamber" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11</a></div><div class="verse">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king came in to see the guests,</span> who by this time had taken their appointed places at table. This second portion of the parable teaches that admission to the visible Church is not all that is required; there is also a scrutiny to be undergone and an award to be made. And that this investigation is keen and searching is denoted by the verb used, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which means not merely, to see casually, but to gaze upon with the intent of seeing the real nature and character of an object. The king makes his appearance in the banqueting hall, not to feast with the guests, but to welcome them, and to examine if they are properly ordered, served, and fitted for the high honour accorded to them. How close and personal is this inquiry is shown by the immediate detection of one unseemly guest among the multitude. The time when he thus comes is, in one view, the day of judgment; but such visitation and scrutiny are always recurring, as at solemn seasons, in days of trial, sacred services, holy communion, when he searches men's hearts, and sees if they are prepared for his presence. <span class="cmt_word">Which had not on a wedding garment;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">not garbed in wedding garment</span>, the genitive expressing the peculiar character or quality of the garment. Wordsworth compares similar phrases: <a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. It is said to have been an Oriental custom to present each guest invited to a royal feast with a festive robe to be worn on the occasion, as nowadays persons admitted to the royal presence are clothed with a caftan. Traces of the custom have been found in <a href="../../par/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-22.htm">2 Kings 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>; but they are not very convincing. The Romans seem to have had such a custom, the robes being called "cenatoria." Thus Martial, 10:87, 11, writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Pugnorum reus ebriaeque noctis,<br />Cenatoria mittat advocato."</span> But the fact remains that this guest had not presented himself in attire befitting the solemnity; in his everyday garb, and with  no proper preparation, he had dared to come to this great festival. What is the spiritual meaning of the wedding garment is much disputed. It is evidently some virtue, or quality, or mark which conditions admission to the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. On the one hand, it is said that both bad and good guests wear it, and its possession does not alter the character of the wearer. Dress is something external and visible, therefore the garment cannot represent an inward grace or feeling, but some outward token by which Christians are distinguished, such as open reception of baptism and sacraments, and public profession of the faith. On the other hand, it is contended that the whole matter is spiritual, though veiled in material forms, and is concerned with man's moral and spiritual nature. Hence it by no means follows that the wedding garment is not intended to have a spiritual signification. Ancient commentators universally look upon it in this light. Some regard it as an emblem of faith in Christ; others, of faith and love combined. "Habete fidem cum dilectione," writes St. Augustine, 'Serm.,' 90, "ista est vestis nuptialis." But it must be observed that faith of some sort was shown by accepting the invitation; so this could not be represented by the special garb which was absent. Others, again, see in it good works, or humility, or the purity effected by the grace of the Holy Spirit. Some moderns take it of "imputed," others of imparted, righteousness, bringing their controversies into the King's presence. chamber. The English Church, taking the marriage feast as a figure of the Holy Communion, applies the wedding garment to that cleansing of the conscience which enables persons to come holy and clean to that heavenly feast (see the first Exhortation to Holy Communion). This is legitimate, but too restricted in its reference. The feast denotes the present and future kingdom of God; the entrance to this is a matter of free grace; the garment is moral fitness, the life and conduct dependent on the due use of God's grace. This is in the power of all who have received the call; they have to act up to the high calling, to be wholly, heartily, really what they profess to be. The scrutiny, whether made in this life or in the life to come, shows how grace has been used, if we have put on Christ, if we have kept our soul pure and white, unsullied by sin, or washed clean by penitential tears and the blood of Christ (see <a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The metaphor concerning this robe of righteousness is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels." Commentators compare (but with doubtful appositeness) <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 8</a>.

Hatred, like poverty, makes men acquainted with strange companions. The Herodians were a political sect which supported the dynasty of Herod, and were more or less favourable to the dominion of Rome, as that which preserved their authority in the country. In religious opinions they were mostly Sadducees. The Pharisees, on the other hand, in their nominal zeal for God, were violently opposed to the claims of Rome, and ready to rebel at the first favourable opportunity. They regarded the Herodians as little better than the heathen whom they favoured, but sunk their differences in the face of a general peril. Between these antagonistic elements an impious league had been formed earlier in Christ's ministry (see <a href="../../par/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Master</span>; <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, equivalent to "Rabbi;" owning him for the nonce as one possessed of teaching authority, though they willed not to be his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">True</span>; truthful.

Caesar at this time was Tiberius; the title was now applied to the emperors, though its subsequent use was different. By asking concerning the lawfulness of the payment, they do not inquire whether it was expedient or advisable to make it, but whether it was morally and religiously right, consistent with their obligation as subjects of the theocratic kingdom. Some, as Judas of Galilee (<a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:1: 1, 6), had resorted to violence in their opposition to the tax; and indeed, the question here put was much debated between opposite parties. The Pharisees were strongly opposed to foreign domination, and thought it derogatory and sacrilegious for the people of Jehovah to pay impost to a foreign and heathen authority. The Herodians, on the other hand, submitted without reserve to the supremacy  of Rome, and, for political reasons, silenced all nationalist and ultra-patriotic feeling. By putting this question, the disputants thought to force Christ into a dilemma, where he must answer directly "Yes" or "No," and where, whichever reply he made, he would equally offend one or other of the parties into which the state was divided. If he affirmed the lawfulness of the tax, he would lose his popularity with the mass of the people, as one who disowned the sovereignty of Jehovah, and would give the death blow to his own claims as Messiah-King. If he garb a negative reply, he would be deemed an enemy of Rome and a promoter of seditious views, and be liable to be handed over to the civil power for the punishment of disaffection and treason (see <a href="../../par/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>). They falsely brought this charge against him before Pilate (<a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>).

The character which they had fiatteringly. given to Jesus (ver. 16) he here fully responds to.

The reply to the question was wholly unexpected. The Pharisaic "disciples" had hoped that Christ would have taken part against the Herodians; but he gives no decision about the matter in dispute, such as they desired. He virtually rebukes their dissimulation, and makes their own action supply the verdict which they demanded. Not seeing the drift of his request, <span class="cmt_word">they brought unto him a penny;</span> <span class="accented">a denarius</span> (see on Matthew 18:28). This was the amount of the capitation tax, and it was paid in Roman, not Jewish, coinage. Just at this period the Jews had no mintage of their own, and were forced to use Roman coins, which might well be called "tribute money."

It must have borne a likeness of the emperor, and,therefore, as Edersheim remarks, must have been either a foreign one (Roman) or possibly one of the Tetrareh Philip, who on some of his coins introduced the image of Tiberius. The coins struck by the Romans in or for Palestine had, in accommodation to Jewish prejudices, no representation of any personage upon them. The Roman denarius at this date had on the obverse side the head of Tiberius, crowned with laurel leaves, and bore the legend, "TI CAESAR DIVI AVG FAVGVSTVS," and on the reverse, a seated female figure, with the inscription, "PONTIF MAXIM."

Rabbinism ruled that the right of coinage appertained to the ruler of a state, and was a proof of <span class="accented">de facto</span> government, which it was unlawful to resist. The current coin, which they used in their daily transactions, showed that the Jews were no longer independent, but set under and acquiescing in a foreign domination. Being subjects of Caesar, it was their duty to submit to his demands, and to pay the taxes which he had a right to levy. This was an answer to the insidious question propounded. Christ does not take either side in the controversy; he makes no question of the mutual rights of conquered and conquerors; he utters no aspiration for the recovery of independence; he uses facts as they are, and points to habitual practice as a sufficient solution of the difficulty. No reply could be wiser or simpler. Herein he gives a lesson for all time. No plea of religion can hold good against obedience to lawful authority. "Render to all their dues," says St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>): "tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour." <span class="cmt_word">The things that</span> <span class="cmt_word">are God's;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The things of God arc ourselves - our life, powers, faculties, means; to use these in God's service is our duty and our privilege. There need be no conflict between religion and politics, Church and state. Let a citizen do his duty to God, and he will find his obligations to the civil power are coincident and harmonious. Let the state respect the rights of God and of conscience, and there will he no collision between itself and the Church, but both will peaceably cooperate for the good of the community. Had the Jews rendered to God his dues, they would never have been reduced to their present state of subjection and debasement; would never have had to pay tribute to a foreign nation.

Their carefully laid plot, which had seemed so irresistible, was utterly frustrated. The view of the relations of Church and state set forth by Christ was novel and incomprehensible. Hitherto the two provinces had been considered identical.  The emperor, as we see impressed on his coins, was Pontifex Maximus; the Jewish priesthood had a political character, and the civil power was its instrument. In Christ's theory the spheres were distinct and not to be confounded. The state compelled obedience to its enactments; the Church left the conscience free, and obedience was voluntary and enforced by no external powers. The new society stood aloof from all political interests, and was responsible alone to God, while it performed its duties. <span class="cmt_word">Left him.</span> They had no answer to give.

The received reading historically describes the Sadducees' opinions; the other makes them come boldly stating their sentiments. Where authorities are pretty evenly balanced, we must decide the wording of a passage by other than literary considerations; and there can be no doubt that the reading which denotes the characteristic of the sect is more appropriate than that which represents them offensively parading their views as a preparation for the coming question. We have had notice of the Saddueees before (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>). The popular account of their religious belief is given in <a href="../../par/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>, "The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit." They were rationalists and sceptics, who denied many old-established truths, and scorned many prevalent observances. They acknowledged most of the Old Testament, though, curiously enough, they, like our modern neologians, stumbled at the supernatural upon which the Scriptures were built. Tradition and traditional interpretations found no favour with them. The future life of the soul they utterly repudiated, and the resurrection of the body, when it was brought before them, met with contemptuous ridicule. The claims and doctrine of Christ were, in their eyes, puerile and unworthy of philosophic consideration. At the same time, they recognized that the people were with him for the moment, and that it was expedient that his teaching, so utterly opposed to their own opinions, should be discredited and repressed. So they came forward asking an imaginary question, which, as they thought, would reduce to an absurdity the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the flesh. Doubtless they were members of the Sanhedrin, and it was at the instigation of this body that they proposed the presumed case of conscience.

This was a law not peculiar to the Hebrews, but prevalent from immemorial times among many ancient peoples, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Persians, Egyptians, and found in force among some nations in modern times, as Arabians, Druses, Cireassians, etc. It seems not to have been enforced in any case, but to have been left to the good will of the survivor, who might escape the obligation by submitting to a certain social obloquy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7-10</a>). The motive of the regulation was the maintenance of a family and the non-alienation of property. Many authorities assert that the law did not apply in the case of a man who left daughters (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>), but only in that of a childless widow. Later rabbinism limited the obligation to a betrothed woman, not yet actually married.

He goes to the root of the matter, and shows the great error in which it originated. These disputants are treated with patience and calm argument, because they are not hypocrites like the Pharisees, but have the courage of their opinions, and do not seek to appear other than they are. They erred, said Christ, for two reasons: first, <span class="cmt_word">not knowing the Scriptures.</span> Whatever might be the lax opinions which they held respecting the prophets, there was no dispute about the supreme authority of the Pentateuch, and these Scriptures (as Christ proceeded to prove) plainly implied the doctrine of the resurrection. Secondly, they ignored <span class="cmt_word">the power of God,</span> to whom nothing is impossible, and who, in the resurrection, would perform a work very different from what they supposed - changing the natural into the spiritual, and transforming the characteristics of the life that now is into a different and higher sphere, yet preserving identity.

The Lord proceeds first to show the power of God as displayed in the resurrection. The Sadducees would limit and control this power by conceiving that it could not change the qualities of the body or alter the conditions and relations of the human consciousness. <span class="cmt_word">In the resurrection</span> (see on ver. 28). <span class="cmt_word">Marry</span>; as men. <span class="cmt_word">Are given in marriage;</span> as women. Marriage is an earthly relationship, and can have no place in a spiritual condition. All that is of the earth, all that is carnal and gross, all human passions, all that is connected with sin and corruption, shall pass away. The risen life is no mere reproduction of the present, but a regeneration, new life added to the old, with new powers, acting under new laws, ranged in a new community. On earth men are mortal, and marriage is necessary to perpetuate the race; no such necessity obtains in the other life, where men are immortal. As an old Father says, "Where the law of death is abolished, the cause of birth is abolished likewise." <span class="cmt_word">Are as the angels of God in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the angels who dwell in heaven.

The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">angeli Dei in coelo.</span> Thus Christ, in opposition to the Saddueces' creed, admits the existence of angels. Glorified men are like the angels in these characteristics especially. They are immortal, no longer subject to human wants, passions, failings, or temptations; they serve God perfectly without weariness or distraction; they have no conflict between flesh and spirit, between the old nature and the new; their life is peaceful, harmonious, satisfying. Our Lord says nothing here concerning mutual recognition in the future state; nothing about the continuance of those tender relations which he sanctions and blesses on earth, and in the absence of which we cannot imagine perfect happiness existing. Analogy supplies some answer to such questions, but they are foreign to Christ's statement, and need not be here discussed.

They may have known the letter, they certainly knew nothing of the spirit of the Word of God, its depth and fulness. The key to the interpretation of the Scripture is faith. It is not enough to be acquainted with the literal signification; this is always inadequate, and denotes not the chief matter intended. To know the Scripture, in the sense of Christ, is to have a clear apprehension of its spiritual aspect, to feel and own the moral and mystical bearing of facts and statements, and to recognize that herein lies the real  significance of the inspired record. The want of this discernment vitiated the Sadducees' treatment and reception of Holy Writ, and involved them in lamentable error. Christ proceeds to demonstrate how the very Pentateuch (reverenced unquestionably by their party), which they deemed to be entirely silent on the subject of the life of the soul, spoke plainly on this matter to all who had faith to understand and appreciate the words of Divine wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">That which was spoken unto you by God.</span> To our minds Jesus might have adduced stronger arguments from other books of Scripture, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; but the Sadducees had drawn their objection from the Pentateuch, therefore from that section of the Bible he refutes them. To the books of Moses was always made the ultimate appeal in confirmation of doctrine; in the supreme authority of these writings all sects agreed. The utterances of the prophets were explained away as allegorical, poetical, and rhetorical; the plain, historical statements of the Law could not at that time be thus treated. Christ endorses unreservedly the Divine inspiration of the Pentateuch; he intimates that it was the voice of God to all time, and providentially directed to disperse such errors as those now produced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a></div><div class="verse">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

The quotation is from <a href="../../par/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, where God gives himself this name, as the Eternal, Self-existent One. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Abraham...Jacob.</span> These patriarchs had long been dead when this revelation was made; had they been annihilated, the Lord could not have called himself still their God. By this utterance he implied that he had still to do with them - had a blessing and a reward which they were to receive, and which they must be alive to enjoy. How can they who are his cease to exist? They who are in personal relation and covenant with God cannot perish. There were personal promises to Abraham, distinguished from those made to his seed (see <a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>, etc.), which were never fulfilled during his earthly life, and await realization in a future existence. God was the patriarchs' Father, Saviour, Redeemer, Judge, Rewarder; he could not hold these relations to mere dust and ashes, but only to con-scions and responsible beings, existing, though in another condition, and in another portion of God's creation. Thus was proved the continued existence and personality of the soul; and the resurrection of the body follows consequentially from this. Man is a complex being; he has body and soul, neither of which is complete without the other. The soul is not perfect man without the body, which is its organ; the body is not perfect man without the soul, which animates it. In giving eternal life to man, God gives it to the creature as originally made, not to one portion only of his nature. <span class="cmt_word">Of the living.</span> "For," as St. Luke adds, "all live unto him." The so called dead are alive in God's view; they have an abiding relation to him, live in his world, which comprises the seen and unseen, the present and the future. Titus St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>), "Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living."

The Sadducees, thus answered in the presence of the listening crowds, attempted no reply, slunk away confounded, utterly foiled in their hope of casting ridicule on the teaching of Christ. St. Luke notes that some scribes present, doubtless of the Pharisaic faction, were highly delighted with this public defeat of their adversaries, and cried, in enforced admiration, "Master, thou hast well said!"

The Pharisees were informed of, and some of them had witnessed, the discomfiture of the Sadducees (see <a href="../../par/luke/20-40.htm">Luke 20:40</a>); hence they deemed it necessary again to attack Jesus by asking a question which specially appertained to their own teaching. They felt that, if they were ever to compass his overthrow, they must first lower his credit with the people, so that these might no longer care to support or defend him. To succeed in entangling Jesus in a difficulty would not only effect this, but would also gain them a triumph over their adversaries, who had been so completely defeated. <span class="cmt_word">Were</span> <span class="cmt_word">gathered together;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>, Which may mean, "to the same place," as perhaps <a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>; or "on the same ground, for the same purpose."

Vulgate, <span class="accented">legis doctor</span>, which gives the right sense; for such were teachers and expounders of the Mosaic Law.

It is evident, from St. Mark's account, that Christ was pleased with him personally, for he said to him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Those who put this lawyer forward had, of course, sinister motives, and hoped to make capital from Christ's answer; but the man himself seems to have been straightforward and honest. We have had the terra "tempting" used in a hostile sense (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), but there is no necessity for so taking it; and it seems to imply here merely the renewal of the attack on Christ.

Which were of absolute obligation? which were not? The schools made a distinction between heavy and light commandments, as though some were of less importance than others, and might be neglected with impunity; and some of such exceeding dignity that fulfilment of them would condone imperfect obedience in the case of others. Some taught that if a man rightly selected some great precept to observe, he might safely disregard the rest of the Law (see <a href="../../par/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, etc.). This was the kind of doctrine against which St. James (<a href="../../par/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>) expostulates: "Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all." The Pharisees may have desired to discover whether Jesus knew and sanctioned these rabbinical distinctions. He had proved himself intimately acquainted with the inner meaning of Scripture, and able to evolve doctrines and to trace analogies which their dull minds had never comprehended; the question now was whether he entered into their subtle divisions and could decide this dispute for them. Such is the view usually taken of the scribe's question; but it may well be doubted, if regard is had to the character of the man, whether he had any intention of entangling Christ in these subtleties, but rather asked for a solution of the general problem - Of what nature was the precept which should be regarded as "first" (Mark) in the Law? We may compare the somewhat similar question and answer in <a href="../../par/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>. Lange's idea, that the scribe wished to force Christ to make some answer which, by implying his own claim to be Son of God, would trench upon the doctrine of monotheism, seems wholly unwarranted. This theory is based on the supposition that the Pharisee took it for granted that Jesus would answer, "Thou shalt love God above all," and intended to found upon that reply a condemnation for having made himself equal with God by his assertion of Sonship. But the text gives no countenance to such intention, and it has been suggested chiefly for the purpose of accounting for Christ's subsequent question (vers. 41-45), which, however, needs no such foundation, as we shall see.

The expressions mean generally that God is to be loved with all our powers and faculties, and that nothing is to be preferred to him. It is difficult to define with any precision the signification of each term used, and much unprofitable labour has been expended in the endeavour to limit their exact sense. "Quum," as Grotius says, "vocum multarum cumulatio nihil quam intensius studium designet." It is usual to explain thus: <span class="accented">Heart</span>; which among the Hebrews was considered to be the seat of the understanding, is here considered as the home of the affections and the seat of the will. <span class="accented">Soul</span>; the living powers, the animal life. <span class="accented">Mind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, intellectual powers.

"This commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-21.htm">1 John 4:21</a>).

Scripture enunciates the duty to God and our neighbour, shows the right method of fulfilling it, warns against the breach of it, gives examples of punishment and reward consequent upon the way in which the obligation has been treated. Thus the unity and integrity of revelation is demonstrated. Its Author is one; its design is uniform; it teaches one path, leading to one great end.

It was as it were a last hope. He and the Pharisees had some common ground, which was wanting in the case of the Sadducees and Herodians (comp <a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>); he would use this to support a last appeal. Let us observe the Divine patience and tenderness of Christ. Not to gain a victory over inveterate enemies, not to expose the ignorance of scribe and Pharisee, not to exhibit his own profound knowledge of the inner harmonies of God's Word, does he now put this question. He desires to win acceptance of his claims by the unanswerable argument of the Scripture which they revered; let them consider the exact meaning of a text often quoted, let them weigh each word with reverent care, and they would see that the predicted Messiah was not merely Son of David according to earthly descent, but was Jehovah himself; and that when he claimed to be Son of God, when he asserted, "I and my Father are one," he was vindicating for himself only what the prophet had affirmed of the nature of the Christ. He had, so to speak, hope that some among his hearers would accept this teaching, and save themselves amid that untoward generation. It was when this last hope failed, when he saw nothing but hardened hearts and wilful prejudice, that he uttered the woes and predictions in the following chapter.

Universal tradition, extending to this very time, which gave to the psalm a Messianic interpretation, is surely more worthy of credit than a theory elaborated in the present century, which in no respect regards the natural signification of the language, and can be made to support the novel idea only by forced and unreal accommodations. By speaking of David as having uttered the quoted words, Christ does not formally state that this king wrote the psalm; he merely gives the accepted view which classed it as Davidic.

The psalmist acknowledges the recipient of the utterance as his sovereign Lord; this could be no earthly potentate, for on earth he had no such superior; Jewish tradition always applied the term unto the Messiah, or the Word. The prediction repeats the promise made by Nathan to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>), which had no fulfilment in his natural progeny, and could be regarded as looking forward only to the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Sit thou on my right</span> <span class="cmt_word">hand.</span> Thus Messiah is exalted to the highest dignity in heaven. Sitting at God's right hand does not necessarily imply complete Divine majesty (as Hengstenberg remarks), for the sons of Zebedee had asked for such a position in Messiah's earthly kingdom (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-21.htm">Matthew 20:21</a>); but it denotes supreme honour, association in government, authority second only to that of Monarch. This is said of Christ in his human nature. He is "equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood." In his Divine nature he could receive nothing; in his human nature all "power was given unto him in heaven and earth" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till I</span> <span class="cmt_word">make</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thine</span> <span class="cmt_word">enemies thy footstool;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>.

The relative particle "till" must not be pressed, as if Christ's session was to cease when his victory was completed. We have before had occasion to observe that the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, asserts nothing of the future beyond the event specified. As St. Jerome says of such negative phrases, "Ita negant praeteritum ut non ponant futurum" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>). Of Christ's kingdom there is no end.

Son?</span> The argument is this: David speaks with highest reverence of Messiah, calling him his Lord: how is this attitude consistent with the fact that Messiah is David's Son? How can Messiah be both Son and Lord of David? We, who have learned the truth concerning the two natures of Christ, can readily answer the question. He is both "the Root and the Offspring of David" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>). The Athanasian Creed offers the required solution of the seeming paradox: "God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the substance of his mother, born in the world; perfect God, and perfect Man...  who although he be God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ." Here was an explanation (if the Pharisees took his words to heart) of much that had excited their indignation, and caused cavil and carping. He claimed to be the Messiah; and Messiah, as Scripture presented him, had a twofold nature. When, therefore, he asserted equality with the Father when he, "being man, made himself God" (<a href="../../par/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>), he was vindicating that Divine nature which he as Messiah possessed. Jesus did not further elucidate this mystery. He had given food for reflection; he had unfolded the hidden meaning of Scripture; he had shown the shallowness of the popular exegesis; the knowledge was here; there was wanting only the will to raise the flower of faith in the heart of these obdurate hearers.

Had they had a real desire to be instructed, they would have profited by the present occasion; coming to the light with honest and good hearts, they would have been enlightened. But this was far from their  wish, so they went away empty. <span class="cmt_word">Neither durst any man.</span> They perceived that they could gain no advantage over Christ by such methods of attack. Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, had ignominiously succumbed; to make a fresh assault was to court a fresh defeat, Seeing this, they dared no longer tempt him in this way. Henceforward they would use other tactics. Treachery and violence must now play their part. These weapons would be more successful in compassing the destruction of the innocent Victim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 21"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 23"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
