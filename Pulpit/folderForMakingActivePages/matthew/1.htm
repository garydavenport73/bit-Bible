As St. Matthew was writing only for Jews, and they, by reason of their Old Testament prophecies, looked for the Messiah to be born of a certain family, he begins his Gospel with a pedigree of Jesus. In this he mentions, by way of introduction, the two points to which his countrymen would have special regard - the descent of Jesus from David, the founder of the royal line, him in whose descendants the Ruler of Israel must necessarily (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>) be looked for; and also from Abraham, who was the head of the covenant nation, and to whom the promise had been given that in his seed all the nations of the earth should bless themselves (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). After this he proceeds to fill up the intervening steps in the genealogy. The spelling of the names in the Authorized Version accords with the Greek, and so varies from the Old Testament orthography; but for the sake of the English reader it is certainly advisable to do what has been done in the Revised Version, viz. to conform the spelling to that of the Old Testament, and, where the Greek varies much, to put that form in the margin. It is better to write <span class="accented">Rahab</span> than <span class="accented">Raehab</span>, and <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span> than <span class="accented">Salathiel.</span> Those who read the Greek Gospels when these were first written read also the Old Testament in Greek, and so were in no confusion. The first verse of the Gospel is doubtless intended as a preface to what is contained in vers. 2-17. It is, indeed, true that the phrase, "the book of the generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">sepher toledoth</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>.1), might <span class="accented">in itself</span> point rather to events and works connected with the active life of him whose name it precedes (cf. the use of <span class="accented">toledoth</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; even Genesis 2:4, <span class="accented">et al.</span>) , <span class="accented">a</span>nd thus might refer to the whole of ch. 1. (Kubel), or even the whole of the First Gospel (Keil); yet the addition of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of David, the Son of Abraham</span>, by summarizing the genealogy, limits the reference of ver. 1 to this alone. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) recurs in ver. 18; but being without <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, has a slightly different meaning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the word translated" generation" in ver. 17 is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, and means a single stratum of human life. The evangelist uses the name Jesus Christ here as a proper name, customary in later Christian circles (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>, and especially the traces of development from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a> to <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>). "Christ" is not used in its signification of "Messiah," or "Anointed," till ver. 17, where it would be better rendered "the Christ." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abraham begat Isaac</span>. From Abraham to David the genealogy in St. Matthew agrees with that in <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. In the other two sections, from Solomon to Zerubbabel, and from Zerubbabel to Christ, there is some difficulty in accounting for the variations, which are considerable. The natural descent of each son from his father is emphasized by the repetition of the word "begat" at every stage (cf., however, ver. 8, note) till we come to Jesus, and then the phrase is varied, "Joseph the husband of  Mary, of whom was born Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">Judas</span> ( <span class="accented">Judah</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">and his brethren</span>. The addition of these words seems very natural here, because the twelve sons of Jacob were the fathers of the tribes of Israel, and as descended from Abraham were heirs of the promises; and although Judah was the tribe from which the Messiah was to spring, he was to be the glory of the whole of Israel. The same words, "and his brethren," are, however, found in ver. 11, where there is no such reason to account for them.

In this genealogy the only women mentioned beside the Virgin Mary herself, who must of necessity be introduced, are Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba, and many explanations have been suggested why these should be specially singled out for notice. The most plausible reasons put forward have been that they are introduced because of the sins with which all but one of them were stained, and because two were not of the race of Israel. Thus, it has been thought, St. Matthew would, in the outset of his Gospel, proclaim Christ as the Friend, even the Kinsman, of sinners, and the Saviour offered to Gentiles as well as to Jews. It is probably wiser not to put so deep a meaning on the appearance of these names, but to consider that they are here because in each case the circumstances were different from the ordinary steps of the genealogy. Had they been in the same position as all the other wives and mothers who are unnamed, they also would have been left unnamed.

This line of descent, from Nahshon to David, is also given by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31, 32</a>), and is derived from <a href="../../par/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>. But it has occasioned some difficulty, because it makes but five steps from Nahshon, who (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>) was one of the heads of fathers' houses at the time of the Exodus, to the days of David. According to the chronology added in the margin of the Authorized Version, this period extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 1490</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 1056</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> more than four hundred and thirty years, thus making a generation to consist in each case of more than eighty years. And even according to the more accurate computation of the date of the Exodus ( <span class="date">B.C. 1304</span>) the period would be two hundred and forty-eight years, thus making each generation nearly fifty years. Even this seems very long, especially in the East; so that it is probable that the genealogy in Ruth, merely adopted by the evangelists, recorded only the more important names. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salmon begat Booz</span> ( <span class="accented">Boaz</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of Rachab</span> ( <span class="accented">Rahab</span>, Revised Version). That this was Rahab of Jericho has been generally received, and it is clear from the narrative in <a href="../../par/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>, where Rahab declares, "The Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath," that, whatever this woman's previous life and character may have been, she was then not unlikely to join herself to the Israelites. Moreover, her great services rendered to the spies, and the conspicuous way in which she and her house were singled out for preservation from all the rest of the city, may have marked her as not unfit to become the wife of a chief man in Israel. The Old Testament says nothing of this marriage, but there has been no endeavour made in the Bible to preserve every detail of the genealogies, the record of the successive fathers being all that for Jewish purposes was required. But that Rahab of Jericho was received among the people of Israel, not merely as one dwelling in their midst (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>), but to a place of honour among them, was an old tradition among the Jews; cf. T. B. Meg., 14 <span class="accented">b</span> ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebr.'), where Neriah, Baruch, Seraiah, Maaseiah, Jeremiah, Hilkiah, Hanameel, and Shallum, and also Huldah, are all said to have sprung from her. Some also say that she was made a proselyte, and was married to Joshua - a tradition followed, as it seems, in the Midrash 'Koh.,' on <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <i>that had been the wife</i> of Urias;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David the king</span>. The mention of David's royal position seems made here because at this point the line of the Messiah first becomes connected with the royal house. At the time when Saul was made king the people chose to have him in opposition to the Divine will; but giving them next as king a man after his own heart, God uses the offence of his people so that it shall become a channel of blessing, and from this king Christ himself shall be born. Of her that had been the wife of Urias. It is not easy to see why Bathsheba is spoken of thus indirectly, as her own name was certainly better known, and is more frequently mentioned in the Old Testament than Uriah's. The phrase seems to call attention most pointedly to David's sin. and that too in a sentence where his kingly dignity has just been markedly emphasized. The way in which God dealt with David and his sin is very parallel to that in which he dealt with the Israelites after their choice of Saul. David's first child, like the Israelites' first king, finds not God's blessing; but the second child is the pledge of peace with God (Solomon) - is Jedidiah, "the beloved of the Lord," as David the second king was the man after God's own heart. She that had been the wife of Uriah, after David's repentance becomes Solomon's  mother. Up to this point the genealogies in St. Matthew and St. Luke have entirely accorded, but with the mention of Solomon we come upon a variation, which continues till the union of the two forms of the pedigree in Salathiel ( <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span>, Revised Ver-zion), the father of Zerubbabel. In St. Matthew the line which is followed is the succession of the kings of Judah from Solomon to Jehoiachin ( <span class="accented">Jechonias</span>) . St. Luke mentions, after David, his son Nathan (of whom we find a notice in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>), and then passes on through a series of nineteen names, none of which is found in other parts of Scripture as belonging to the race of David. We have nothing, therefore, with which to compare them; but in number they correspond very nearly with the known descendants in the line of Solo,non, so that, although we cannot verify the names, the list bears upon its face the appearance of being derived from some duly kept record of the pedigree of Nathan, the son of David.

Between Joram and Uzziah the pedigree omits three names - Ahaziah immediately succeeded Joram (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>), and was followed by his son Joash (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>), and he by his son Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1</a>). These were probably left out, that the number of generations might be reduced to <span class="accented">fourteen.</span> It is not likely that St. Matthew omitted them, but that they were absent from the form which he used. If we seek for a reason why these precise names are omitted, we may probably find it in the fact of their being descended from Jezebel; while the language of the second commandment would suggest that to the fourth generation the children' of that race would suffer for the sins of their parents. To the Jewish compiler of this genealogy no argument more forcible for the removal of these names could have been suggested. It will be seen that the word "begat" in these verses does not signify always the direct succession of son to father.

Here we come upon another omission. Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim, and he the father of Jechoniah (called also Jehoiachin); see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>. The omission is supplied in some few manuscripts; but it may be only the case of a marginal note in a previous copy having found its way into the text. There is, however, something to be said in favour of its acceptance. The similarity between the names Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin is very great, especially in some of the Greek forms, so that they might easily be confused, and thus a verse be omitted in some very early text. Then Jehoiachin (Jechonias) apparently had no brethren (but see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a>), whereas Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, had two or three (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>). To make the whole pedigree agree with the Old Testament records some addition in this form would appear necessary; <span class="accented">Josiah begat</span> [<span class="accented">Jehoiakim and his brethren</span>, <span class="accented">and Jehoiakim begat</span>] <span class="accented">Jechoniah about the time</span>, etc. But manuscript evidence for this is extremely slight ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.,' i,). Yet the supposition that the name of Jehoiakim has been omitted removes what has seemed to many another difficulty. As the list now stands, to make up the fourteen in the third as well as in the second section of the genealogy it is necessary to count Jehoiachin - a king whose reign lasted only three mouths (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>) - twice over. He closes the second fourteen and begins the third. There is nothing like this found at the other division. To substitute Jehoiakim after Josiah would avoid this repetition of the name of such a very insignificant person, especially as the reign of Jehoiakim lasted eleven years (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). And to mention Jehoiakim as the father of Jehoiachin "at the time of the carrying away to Babylon" would be very appropriate, whereas to say Josiah begat his children at that date is not so strictly correct. It seems, then, probable that we have here some clerical error, which may have existed already in the list which St. Matthew used. About the time. The preposition in the Greek means rather, "<span class="accented">at</span> the time." The Authorized Version, however, gives the sense, for the birth of Jehoiachin must have been some years before the commencement of the Babylonish conquest, which may be said to have begun with Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of the land in Jehoiakim's days (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jechonias begat Salathiel</span> ( <span class="accented">Sheal-tiel</span>, Revised Version). From <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a> it has sometimes been thought that Jechoniah died childless, though the preceding context, which speaks of him and his seed, seems hardly to warrant the supposition; but clearly the words of the prophet there imply that none of his descendants should attain to a position such as was held by Zerubbabel, and that his family should soon come to an end. If we look at the genealogy in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> we find Assir mentioned as the son of Jechoniah (cf., however, Revised Version, "Jeconiah <span class="accented">the captive"</span>), and Salathiel as his son; and in the next verse Pedaiah, a brother of Salathiel, is named as father of Zerubbabel. By St. Luke (Luke 3:27) Salathiel is called the son of Neri, and in <a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>; and <a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel.  These are all the details we have, and to decide on how they are related to each other is very difficult. We may, perhaps, be right in supposing that Pedaiah, the brother of Shealtiel, having died, his son Zerubbabel was adopted by Shealtiel. We must then suppose that, the royal line through Solomon having ended, and Jechoniah's only child, Assir (if he ever existed, <span class="accented">vide supra</span>) , having left no issue, the line of David is taken up through the family of the other son, Nathan, and that from him descended Neri, the father of Shealtiel, who takes the place of Jechoniah's issue, which has altogether failed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-13.htm">Matthew 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Zorobabel</span> ( <span class="accented">Zerubbabel</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">begat Abiad</span>. Here the two lines of pedigree in St. Matthew and St. Luke seem tc separate, and not to converge again till we come to Matthan (or Matthat), the grandfather of Joseph, which name is common to both. The Bishop of Bath and Wells has shown some reason for supposing that <span class="accented">Rhesa</span>, mentioned in St. Luke as Zerubbabel's son, is merely a title signifying "a chief," and also for identifying Hananiah, who is called a son of Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a>), with Joanna, who follows Rhesa in St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>), and there being some relation between the Juda of St. Luke and the Abiud (i.e. father of Juda) given as Zerubbabel's son in St. Matthew. Except in these few particulars, the two lines show no connexion of names, and it seems likely that the family of David had fallen into low estate for several generations before the birth of Christ.

St. Luke makes Matthat (or Hatthan; the names are from the same root, and in some texts are identical), to be the son of Levi. This is probably the actual fact. St. Luke seems to have traced the genealogy from Zerubbabel through a younger, son, St. Matthew through an elder. But the elder line failing, Matthan, the son of Levi, of the younger branch, becomes heir to, and is called son or, Eleazar, of the senior line. As the promise of the Messiah was to the house of David, and this was known to every Jew, we need not be surprised to find the families descended from that king preserving most careful records of every branch of the family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/1-16.htm">Matthew 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary</span>. St. Luke calls Joseph "the son of Heli." There are two ways in which these differing statements may be made to accord. The two sons of Matthan were Jacob the elder, and Heli the younger. It may be that Mary was the only child of Jacob, and Joseph the son of Heli. Then by marriage with his cousin, Joseph would become Jacob's son as well as Heli's. Or it may be that Jacob died without children, and Heli, marrying his widow according to the Jewish usage, became by her the father of Joseph, who hence would be called Jacob's son, that the elder brother's line might not die out. The points noticed above in respect of these varying pedigrees seem to be all those on which anything needs to be said with the view of comparing them. Their variety stands as a constant evidence of the independence of the two evangelists. Had either of them been conscious of the existence of the other's work. it is inconceivable that he would have made no effort to adjust the pedigree, for which he would possess means now lost for ever. They both design to give us the descent of Joseph from David, this being what a Sew would most regard. The descent of Mary from David is nowhere definitely mentioned in the Gospels, but that Jesus was sprung from David on the mother's side too we are warranted in concluding from the words of the angel to Mary (Luke 1:82), "his father David" (cf. also Delitzsch, 'Hess. Proph.,' &sect; 17). But though we ought not to spend vain labour in attempting to reconcile these two genealogies of Joseph, we can see, from what we know of Jewish customs, grounds enough for understanding how these variations came to exist. The same Jew, we find, was often known under two names; of this we have several examples in the lists of the twelve apostles. It is possible, therefore, that in these two pedigrees there may have been more points of union than we are able to detect. Then the rule, before alluded to, by which a man took the childless widow of his deceased brother for his wife and raised seed unto his brother, may also have led to much confusion of names, which we have now no means of unravelling. The evangelists drew each his own list from some authentic source, accessible to others beside themselves, and the record of which could be verified when the Gospels were set forth. This should satisfy us that those we have received were held by the Jews soon after Christ's time to be truthful records, and that each established from a Jewish point of view the descent of the putative father of Jesus from King David. <span class="cmt_word">Of whom was born Jesus</span>. This name, which, through <span class="accented">Jeshua</span>, is the Greek form <span class="accented">of Joshua</span> (for which, indeed, it stands in the Authorized Version of <a href="../../par/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>), signifies "Jehovah is help," and was not an uncommon name among the Jews, though given with marked significance at this time (see ver. 21). We find, according to the best texts, that in <a href="../../par/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> this name occurs in the pedigree of Joseph (where the Authorized Version has Jose), and the Revised Version has adopted that reading. (Of the way in which  the name was augmented when given to the famous successor of Moses, see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-16.htm">Numbers 13:16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Who is called Christ</span>. The evangelist here alludes merely to the well-known fact that Jesus was called by this name. The significance of the word, which is a translation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Messiah</span>, is "anointed," and in the Old Testament it is given to priests (as <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3, 5, 16</a>), to a king appointed by Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>), also to King Cyrus (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), and to some unnamed representative of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). It was subsequently applied to Jesus both in the Greek form and in the Hebrew (<a href="../../par/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It must, however, be noticed ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Bishop Westcott, Add. Note on <a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>) that it was not a characteristic title of the promised Saviour in the Old Testament, and was not even specifically applied to him, unless, perhaps, in <a href="../../par/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25, 26</a> - a passage of which the interpretation is very doubtful.

To make the list more easy to remember, the names were so ordered that there should be the same number in each of the three divisions.

The object of this paragraph is to show that Messiah was in origin not of man but of God. This fact was accepted even by his reputed father Joseph, who was only convinced of it after a special communication by an angel in a dream; giving him the facts of the case, and foretelling that a son would be born, and that this Son would be the expected Saviour; and also showing from prophecy that such union of God with man was no unheard-of supposition, but the fulfilment and completion of ancient thought suggested by God. Joseph at once accepts the communication and takes Mary home, avoiding, however, all cause for the supposition that the child was, after all, of human origin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the birth</span> (ver. 1, note). <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("generation") of the received text refers to the causative act, the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) to the birth itself (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/1-14.htm">Luke 1:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of Jesus Christ was on this wise</span>. The Revised Version margin says, "Some ancient authorities read, 'of the Christ,'" but perhaps the reading, "of Christ Jesus" (B [Origen]), is even preferable, as in no good manuscript of the New Testament is the article elsewhere prefixed to "Jesus Christ," and the easy residing, "of the Christ," would hardly provoke alteration, while it might easily arise from assimilation to the preceding "unto the Christ" of ver. 17 (cf. Dr. Hort, in Westcott and Hort, 'Appendix.' Bishop Westcott, however, seems to prefer the reading. "of the Christ," and so distinctly Irenaeus, 3:16). If the reading, "of Christ Jesus," be accepted, the evangelist purposely repeats his phrase of ver. 17, and then identifies him with the historic Person. <span class="cmt_word">When as</span>. The Revised Version omits "as" because obsolete; cf. "what time as." <span class="cmt_word">His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph</span>; <span class="accented">had been betrothed</span> (Revised Version), the tense clearly showing that the betrothal had already taken place. Betrothal was and is with the Semitic races a much more formal matter than with us, and as binding as marriage; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; cf. also the words of the angel, "Mary thy wife" (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">Before they came together</span>; including, probably, both the home-bringing (ver. 24) and the consummation (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">She was found</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Although Cureton ('Corp. Ign.,' p. 271) shows that the Aramaic equivalent is used in the sense of "became," and wishes to see this weaker meaning in several passages of the Greek Testament (including, apparently, the present), the references that he gives (<a href="../../par/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-12.htm">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>) do not justify us in giving up the stronger and more usual sense. On <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> always involving more or less prominently the idea of a surprise, cf. Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a>.

According to the usual interpretation of these words, "the Holy Ghost" refers to the Third Person of the Trinity, and "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) is used because the agent can be regarded as the immediate source (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-2.htm">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>). But the questions suggest  themselves: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> whether <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is here used in a strictly Christian or in a pre-Christian sense? and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if the latter, what was this pre-Christian sense? As to (1), it may be argued that the evangelist himself, writing long after Pentecost, and recording sayings taught among Christians only alter Pentecost, would naturally wish his words to be understood in a Christian sense; and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here has at least that comparatively developed doctrine of the Personality of the Holy Ghost which we find indicated in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14-16</a>. It may, however, be justly replied that the words are in themselves rather a record of the feelings of Joseph and Mary about the Incarnation, and are merely a translation of the phrase <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> (or its Aramaic equivalent, <span class="accented">Ruah Kudsha</span>) , which they themselves used; and that hence its true meaning here must be rather sought in the meaning of the Semitic phrase in pre-Christian times. In other words, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here means neither more nor less than <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> meant on the lips of a godly and instructed Jew before the teaching of Christ, and especially before Pentecost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was this pre-Christian sense? What did R<span class="accented">uah-hakodesh</span> mean? To answer this fully would be to compile a treatise on one of the most difficult and disputed points of Old Testament and early Jewish theology. But a cursory comparison of passages in the Old Testament and the pre-Christian writings seems to show that, though there are many places which quite fall in with the Trinitarian view, and which are often marked by strong personification of the Spirit (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10-14</a>; cf. further App. A. in Dr. Sharpe's 'The Tree of Life,' Cambridge, 1889), religious Jews did not understand by <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> a permanent and distinct hypostasis in the Deity, but rather the Deity itself in relation to the world as the Source and Maintenance of its life (<a href="../../par/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; cf. Wisd. 1:7 Wisd. 12:1), in contrast to the Deity absolutely and as the object of worship. Pre-Christian thought, that is to say, used the term "Holy Spirit" as designating the One God in a certain relation to the world, not as designating a permanent and real distinction in the Godhead. If this be so, we must understand the phrase here to mean that Christ was conceived of God (not of any Person in the Godhead) in contrast to man. We may, perhaps, even give to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> its fullest meaning of" origin" (cf <a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The phrase as a whole thus only insists that the Child was by origin Divine. It will be noticed that <a href="../../par/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a> is then closely parallel, "the Holy Ghost" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) there apparently connoting an outpouring of life; "the power of the Most High" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), an outpouring of strength. Dorner ('System.,' 3:343; cf. 162, etc.) says that the expression in our text is "the less precise ancient Christian designation of the Divine Essence generally, out of which ( <span class="accented">de quo</span>) Christ has come. To the Holy Spirit in the Trinitarian sense is only to be ascribed, according to the Scriptures, first, the internal preparation of humanity for the Divine Incarnation, and, secondly, after the <span class="accented">Unio</span> the animation of the humanity of Christ by the Divine power issuing from the Logos." The passage in Martensen's 'Dogmatics,' &sect; 139, so well known for its latter part, apparently agrees with this: "He is born not of the will of a man, nor of the will of the flesh; but the holy will of the Creator took the place of the will of man and of the will of the flesh, - that is, the creating Spirit, who was in the beginning, fulfilled the function of the plastic principle. He was born of the Virgin Mary, the chosen woman in the chosen people. It was the task of Israel to provide, not, as has been often said, Christ himself, but the mother of the Lord; to develop the susceptibility for Christ to a point when it might be able to manifest itself as the pro-foundest unity of nature and spirit - a unity which found expression in the pure virgin. In her the pious aspirations of Israel and of mankind, their faith in the promises, are centred; she is the purest point in history and in nature, and she, therefore, becomes the appointed medium for the new creation." Observe that the Greek Creeds (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, Marcellus] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) , by not inserting the article (contrast afterwards <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) , probably intended only to reproduce St. Matthew's language. The Latin could not fail to be ambiguous (de <span class="accented">Spiritu Sancto</span>) . If, however, we divest ourselves of considerations directly derived from exegesis, and, turning to the theological side, ask which Person of the Blessed Trinity, in fact, prepared Mary for the Incarnation of the Second Person, we must undoubtedly answer that it was the Third Person. For this is his peculiar function, uniting alike the Persons in the Godhead and also the Godhead to creation (cf. Dorner, 'System.,' 1:425,437; 4:159, etc.).

Comparative salvation from sin, due to acceptance of Christ, must precede that restoration which Joseph then desired, and all true Jews still ardently pray for; full salvation from sin will be the final issue of that restoration. From their sins. With a greater salvation,  therefore, than that which Manoah's wife was told that her son should begin to accomplish (<a href="../../par/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). Observe that this promise of Christ as Saviour is given to Joseph, who had deeper experience of sin (ver. 20, note), while to Mary, who is marked by promptness of personal devotion, is given the promise of Christ as King (<a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <span class="accented">Sate</span>... <span class="accented">from</span>( <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>) , not merely "out of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>), but from all attacks of sin considered as coming born without (but see <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note).

The answer is, as it seems, that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> '<span class="accented">almah</span>, by derivation, means "young woman" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Cheyne). but in ordinary usage, "virgin." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When the promise was uttered by Isaiah, the word suggested" virgin," but not (for who would have supposed such a thing?) maintenance of the virginity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The child, thus naturally born, should be called "Immanuel," in sign of God's presence with his people to deliver them from Rezin and Pekah, and, while he was still in childhood, this deliverance should come. The definite article prefixed to "virgin" (<span class="accented">ha-'almah</span>) either designated a person who was known to the prophet and perhaps also to Ahaz, or, as "the article of species" (Cheyne), pictured the person more definitely to the mind, though in herself unknown. Thus the promise meant to Ahaz and Isaiah that a woman, at that time a virgin, should bear a son, synchronous with whose childhood should be the Lord's deliverance of his people. It is possible that Isaiah further saw in this child' the hoped-for Messiah, identifying it with that of <a href="../../par/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>, the long time that was yet to intervene being hidden from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The angel sees a further meaning in the promise than either Ahaz or Isaiah saw, and perceives that, in the providence of God, the words were so chosen as to form a promise of a virgin-birth, the son being of suck origin that, in the highest sense, he could be truly called "Immanuel." "It seems not unwise to suppose that God, who designed to send his Son to be the Deliverer of mankind, so ordered the course of the world in his Divine providence that many things should tell of the coming Saviour, so that when he appeared those who had studied God's revelation should tirol that the scheme of salvation had been one and the same throughout all time. Thus by past events, which had specific meaning in their own time, are found to have further con-rained a prefiguration of greater things in time to come; and to have been promises, ready to receive their highest accomplish-merit as soon as the fitness of time should appear" (Dr. Lumby). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall call</span>.

St. Matthew emphasizes the interpretation in order to, bring out the fact that this Son, now to be born to Joseph, shall not only be Jesus, Saviour, but also <span class="accented">God</span> with us; he is the manifestation of God in our midst.
