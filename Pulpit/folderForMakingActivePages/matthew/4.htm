(Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>; a summary in <a href="../../par/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12, 13</a>.) The Father's acceptance of the Lord's consecration of himself for the work of the kingdom does not exclude temptation, but rather necessitates it. Psychologically, the reaction from the ecstasy of joy in hearing the announcement of <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a> was certain; ethically, such testing as would accompany the reaction was desirable. Even the Baptist was, as it seems, not without a special temptation during this period (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; and Bishop Westcott's note). At the very commencement of his official life the Lord is led consciously to realize that he has entered on a path of complete trust (even as his brethren in the flesh, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>) for all personal needs, a path which required great calmness and common sense, and along which he must take his orders for final victory, not from worldly principles, but direct from God. In Luke the order of the second and third temptations is reversed. Against the supposition of Godet and Ellicott, that St. Luke is historically correct, the "Get thee hence  Satan!" (ver. 10) seems conclusive. At any rate, for St. Matthew's aim in this Gospel the temptation that he places third is the crucial one; the true King will not take an irregular method of acquiring sovereignty. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; temporal. Mark, "and straightway." Immediately after the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him. <span class="cmt_word">Was led up ... into the wilderness.</span> <span class="accented">Up</span> (Matthew only); from the Jordan valley into the higher country round (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), in this case into the desert (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). There is nothing told us by which we may identify the place, but as the scene of the temptation must have been near the scene of the baptism, namely, on the west side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note), it may be presumed that the temptation was on the west side also. The sharp limestone peak (Godet) known since the Crusades as Quarantana, "from the quarantain, or forty days of fasting" (Trench, Studies,' p. 6), may, perhaps, have been the actual spot. The only important objection to this is that directly after the temptation (as seems most probable) he comes to John in "Bethany beyond Jordan," <a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> (not necessarily to be identified with "Bethabara" of the Received Text; its locality is quite unknown). If he went east of Jordan after the temptation, he would still be on one of the great roads to Galilee (<a href="../../par/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52</a>, etc.). The conjecture that the fasting and temptation took place on Sinai is suggested by the analogy of Moses and Elijah, but by absolutely nothing in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">Led up of the Spirit into the wilderness;</span> Mark, "the Spirit driveth him forth;" Luke, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness" (with a leading that lasted throughout the temptation, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>...<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). He was no doubt himself inclined to go apart into the desert that he might meditate uninterruptedly upon the assurance just given, and the momentous issues involved in his baptism; but the Holy Spirit had also his own purposes with him. The Holy Spirit cannot, indeed, tempt, but he can and does lead us into circumstances where temptation is permitted, that we may thereby be proved and disciplined for future work. In Christ's case the temptation was an important part of that moral suffering by which he learned full obedience (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Notice that even if the expression in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>, "the Spirit of God descending," does not in itself go beyond the expressions of Jewish teachers who deny his Personality, it would be hard to find so personal an action as is implied by the words, "Jesus was led up of the Spirit," attributed to the Spirit in non-Christian writings. For <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10, 11, 14</a> is much less definite, and passages, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>  in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12-14</a>, interpret themselves by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. To St. Matthew himself the Personality of the Holy Ghost must, in the light of <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, have been an assured fact. <span class="cmt_word">To be tempted of the devil</span>. So Luke; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great calumniator, him whose characteristic is false accusation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> against men (<a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10-12</a>); against God (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>). Here chiefly in the latter aspect. Each of the three temptations, and they are typical of all temptations; is primarily a calumniation of God and his methods. Mark has "of Satan," a Hebrew word equivalent to "adversary," which the LXX. nearly always renders by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, (compare also <a href="../../par/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22, 32</a>). Probably by the time of the LXX. the idea of the evil spirit accusing as in a law-court, was more prominent than the earlier thought of him as an adversary. Spiritual resistance by the evil spirit to all good is a less-developed thought than his traducing God to man, and, after some success obtained, traducing man to God. Evil may resist good; it may also accuse both God and those made after the likeness of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had fasted...  he was afterwards an hungred</span>. He was so absorbed in prayer that it was only after his six weeks meditation that he felt the need of food. But though his humanity had been elevated and his spiritual sense quickened by this at the time almost unconscious fast, it left him physically prostrate and completely exposed to attack. "In certain morbid conditions, which involve a more or less entire abstinence from food, a period of six weeks generally brings about a crisis, after which the demand for nourishment is renewed with extreme urgency. The exhausted body becomes a prey to a deathly sinking. Such, doubtless, was the condition of Jesus; he felt himself dying. It was the moment the tempter had waited for to make his decisive assault" (Godet). Luke (cf. Mark?) probably (though not in the Revised Version) represents the temptation as continuous during the whole period. Of this Matthew says nothing, but only describes the final scenes, when the might of the tempter was felt to the uttermost, and his defeat was most crucial. <span class="cmt_word">Forty</span>. Trench's remark is well worth study: "On a close examination we note it to be everywhere there [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Holy Scripture] the number or signature of penalty, of affliction, of the confession, or the punishment, of sin (Studies, p. 14). <span class="cmt_word">Nights</span>. The mention of nights as well as days brings out more vividly the continuance and the completeness of the abstinence (cf <a href="../../par/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4, 12</a> [17, LXX.]; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9.htm">Deuteronomy 9</a>, especially 18; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>).  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tempter</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> only; cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Came</span>; came up to him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>). The word expresses local nearness, and suggests, though we cannot affirm it as certain, that he appeared visibly. The thought of physical nearness is continued in "taketh him" (vers. 5, 8), and "the devil leaveth him" and "angels came near" (ver. 11; cf. ver. 5, note). On the other hand, such expressions may be parabolic, and intended to express the closeness of the spiritual combat. To him; not after "came," but after "said" (Revised Version, with manuscripts). If thou be; <span class="accented">art</span> (Revised Version) (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>) - the "if" of assumption (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>). The devil does not attempt to throw doubt on the truth of the utterance in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. His words rather mean, "Thou knowest what was said, thou bast been gradually realizing that assurance of Sonship; use, then, that privilege which thou undoubtedly hast" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>, where, in mockery, the same truth is assumed). Wetstein, following Origen and pseudo-Ignatius,' Philipp.,' &sect; 9, says that the tempter did not know, or at least doubted, whether Jesus was really God, for otherwise he would never have tempted him. This is, surely, to miss the meaning of the temptation for our Lord himself; for he was tempted as Man. Satan might well haw known that he was God incarnate, and yet not have known whether as Man he might not yield. Weiss ('Life,' 1:343) mistakenly thinks that the object of this first temptation was to insinuate doubt in the mind of Jesus as to his Messiahship. "Command that these stones become bread, and if thou canst not do so, then thou art not the Son of God." <span class="cmt_word">Command that</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (cf.

Farrar (on <a href="../../par/luke/4-3.htm">Luke 4:3</a>; and especially in 'Life of Christ,' illustrated edit., pp. 99, 100) suggests that there is a special reference to the "loaf-shaped fossils," <span class="accented">septaria</span>, which are found in Palestine - as, indeed, in most other countries. But though these "flattened nodules of calcareous clay, ironstone, or other matter" (Page, ' Handbook of Geolog. Terms,' etc., 1859, p. 327) often assume fantastic shapes, perhaps even distantly resembling either an English loaf or a fiat Jewish cake (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) , it seems quite unnecessary to see any allusion to them here.

"The Israelites made bread in the form of an oblong or round cake, as thick as one's thumb, and as large as a plate or Platter; hence it was not cut, but [<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>] broken" (Thayer). In Luke the devil points to one stone only, and tempts him to bid it become a loaf.

Our Lord's three quotations are from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16, 13</a>. Some portion of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21, because included in the Sh'ma) was the first part of Scripture taught a Jewish child. Possibly, though there is no evidence upon the subject, the neighbouring portions were often added. If they had been in our Lord's case, such a recurrence of them to his mind in his present state of exhaustion is in complete accord with psychological probability. <span class="cmt_word">Man...  God</span> (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, LXX.). As we could not accept Weiss's interpretation of the object of the devil's temptation, so neither can we accept his interpretation of our Lord's reply, that it is equivalent to "Not by means either natural or supernatural, is man's life really sustained, but by exact obedience to God's command." Our Lord quotes the passage in its primary meaning, which was fully applicable to the present occasion. It is equivalent to "Man lives, not necessarily by natural means, but by even supernatural means, if God so wishes." "The creative word, the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which alone imparts to the bread its sustaining power, can sustain, even as he is confident that in the present need it will sustain, apart from the bread" (Trench, 'Studies,' p. 35). The words of Deuteronomy are paraphrased in Wisd. 16:26, where the author, in a thoroughly Jewish exposition, enumerates the lessons taught by the giving of the manna. "It was altered...  that thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man; but that it is thy Word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee." <span class="cmt_word">By every word</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> (Textus Receptus; Westcott and Hort) is doubtless right. The alteration to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (Lath-mann, Tregelles) is probably due to a tendency towards the simple expression of <span class="accented">means</span>, but perhaps to the feeling that life, especially spiritual life, is maintained rather <span class="accented">in</span> a sphere than on a basis (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the devil taketh him up.</span> Revised Version omits "up." Matthew (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, here and ver. 8) lays stress on the companionship, and, in a sense, compulsion; Luke (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 9; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 5), on guidance and locality. <span class="cmt_word">Into the holy city</span> (Luke, "into Jerusalem"). From <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>, the end of which verse, "There shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean," heightens the implied contrast of the devil's presence there. (For the expression, cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11, 12</a>.)

The right reading (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in Luke) is probably a trace of the basis common to the two records. Possibly, however, it may here be a merely accidental similarity with Luke (who employs the aorist throughout the section), caused by Matthew's desire to emphasize the momentariness of the devil's act. Some think that, as at the end of the temptation Christ is in the wilderness, this removal to Jerusalem is solely mental, without any motion of his body. Improbable; for to make such a temptation <span class="accented">real</span>, our Lord's mind must have suffered complete illusion. He must have <span class="accented">thought</span> that he was "on the pinnacle." <span class="cmt_word">On</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">pinnacle</span> of the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) . What is exactly meant by this definite and evidently well-known term is not easy now to determine. "Some understand this of the top or apex of the sanctuary (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)  [cf. Hegesippus, in Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 2:23:11, 12 (Heinichen), where the Jews bid James stand, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and it is afterwards said that they set him <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>]; others of the top of Solomon's porch; and others of the top of the Royal Portico" (Thayer). Of this last Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11. 5) makes special mention, saying, in his exaggerated style, that human sight could not reach from the top of it to the bottom of the ravine on whose edge it stood. Edersheim ('Life,' etc., 1:303) thinks that possibly the term means "the extreme corner of the 'wing-like' porch, or <span class="accented">ulam</span>, which led into the Sanctuary." This last would suit a possible interpretation of <a href="../../par/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, as referring to a part of the temple under the name of "the pinnacle," which had been used for heathen sacrifices, probably in the worship of the sun. Cf. Revised Version margin there, with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of Theodotion's version, and also the LXX. itself (<span class="accented">vide</span> Field's 'Hexapla').

Luke omits only "in all thy ways." The clause, according to either record, was omitted possibly because the devil shrank from reminding Jesus of "ways" which he need not take; more probably because . ' ways" hardly fitted this case (cf. Weiss). Trench ('Studies,' p. 40), following St. Bernard, says that the omission of the clause alters the whole character of the quotation, considering that "ways" implies ways appointed by God. But this appears to be strained. The devil, appealing to Jesus' consciousness of abiding communion with God (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>), bids him enjoy to the full the promise of God's protection. There is no thought here of a "miracle of display" to the multitudes who were assembled, "as a matter of course," on the temple area (Meyer; cf. even Trench). Neither the devil's solicitation nor our Lord's reply hint at anything else than Divine protection. If it be urged that for this any one of the many precipices by the Dead Sea, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> those of the Quamntana (ver. 1, note) itself, would have been sufficient, the answer may be found in the fact that at the temple, the seat of God's special manifestation, God's special protection might be looked for.

In favour of the latter view is the fact that the recitative <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is not used elsewhere in this section (vers. 4, 7, 10), but as in <a href="../../par/luke/4-10.htm">Luke 4:10</a> it can hardly be other than recitative (for another <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is inserted before "on their hands"), the probability is that it was recitative in the oral source, and therefore recitative here. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">on</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

The Quarantana, which "commands a noble prospect" (Soein's ' Baedeker,' p. 263), may have been the spot.

The devil puts "these things" and "thee" in the sharpest contrast. In Luke the devil says, "To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the authority] hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there the devil speaks of giving, not actual possession of the things themselves (Matthew), but the authority that this implied, "and the glory of them." According to St. Luke, he does not attempt to conceal the fact that he has not absolute possession, but he claims authority as delegated to him, and as capable of being delegated by him to another. His claim was false as absolutely stated, but is true relatively in so far that even his usurpation of power must have been permitted (cf. our Lord's term for him, "The prince of this world"). <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt fall down and worship me;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prostrate thyself in obeisance before me - the Eastern method of acknowledging the superiority of a person (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a>). The expression does not mean "worship me as God" (for this surely was far too coarse a temptation to overcome any even ordinarily pious Israelite; cf.

It is not a question of apostasy (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), but of submission to the methods inculcated by Satan, which placed the immediate and the visible above the future and the unseen (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>).

This temptation calls out a passionate utterance of a personality stirred, because touched, in its depths.

Note). Our Lord's reply cuts up the devil's solicitation by the root. "I do not enter," he means, "into the question of thy authority over these things, and of thy power concerning them. I acknowledge thee not. The command which I willingly obey excludes all homage and service to any other over-lord than God alone. I accept not thy orders and thy methods. I take my commands direct from God." Observe that our Lord does not say <span class="accented">how</span> he is to gain the kingdoms for his own; this would be the care of him whose command he follows. But before ascending, the Lord proclaimed (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>) that he had received (i.e. gained through suffering, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>: <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) more than (note "in heaven") what the devil would have given him as a reward of obedience to false principles.

If we had the synoptic Gospels alone, we should have supposed that the Baptist was imprisoned immediately after the end of our Lord's temptation (cf. this verse with <a href="../../par/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>); but St. John (<a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>) expressly states that he had not been cast into prison when the events recorded in <a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43-3:23</a> took place. "For a time Christ and the Baptist worked side by side, preaching ' repentance' (<a href="../../par/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> [also <a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>]) and baptizing [<a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>]. The Messiah took up the position of a prophet in Judaea, as afterwards in Galilee" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-24</a>). The events in Galilee related in <a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a> were "preparatory to the manifestation at Jerusalem which was the real commencement of Christ's Messianic work. St. John records the course and issue of this manifestation: the other Evangelists start with the record of the Galilaean ministry, which dates from the imprisonment of the Baptist" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). He adds, on <a href="../../par/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43</a>, "It seems probable that the earlier part of the synoptic narratives (<a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14 - 2:14</a>, and parallels) must be placed in the interval which extended from <a href="../../par/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43-5:1</a>." Matthew alone states directly that the news of the Baptist having been taken by Herod was the motive of our Lord's withdrawal into Galilee. He says nothing to show whether our Lord withdrew because he would avoid a like treatment himself, or, as is on the whole more likely, because he did not wish to be mixed up in the tumults to which John's capture appears to have given rise (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was cast into prison;</span> "was delivered up" (Revised Version and Authorized Version margin); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, absolutely (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>). If the more proper meaning of the word may be insisted on, the thought is of the person to whom John was committed rather than of the place; John being delivered up, that is to say, by Herod to his officials. But in usage it appears rather to mean only compulsory removal, loss of liberty. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>) points out the temporary protection that the imprisonment gave to John against the resentment of Herodias. <span class="cmt_word">He departed</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he withdrew</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,.

In Galilee he would still be in Herod's dominions; but, as being in his own home, he would not attract so much attention. N.B. - Between vers. 12 and 13 some place the incident of his preaching at Nazareth (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>); but ver. 23 of that passage assumes much previous work at Capernaum, and can therefore hardly be as early as this.

He himself explains the discrepancy by saying that St. Matthew imitates the Haggadistic methods in accommodating the geography to the text he quotes. But it is clear that the expression is satisfied by the fact that Zebulun was really near Capernaum, and that numbers of those who frequented the town must have come from Zebulun. The position of Capernaum thus formed quite a sufficient reason for quoting the prophecy in Isaiah. Our evangelist, who (ch. 2.) had noticed the coining of distant heathen to worship Messiah, though he was persecuted by the then ruler of the nation, found it very significant that his public activity should begin at a distance from the home of the hierarchy, and in a district which had been the first to suffer from heathen attacks in the past, and had at the present moment a population in which there was a great mixture of the heathen element (cf. Weiss, 'Matthiaus-Evang.').

A kind of confederacy, originally of ten towns, the organization being apparently the work of Pompey. All were east of Jordan except Bethshan (Scythopolis). The names, as given in Pliny, are - Damascus, Philadelphia, Raphana, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippus, Dium, Pella, Galasa (read <span class="accented">Gerasa</span>) , Kanatha. Schurer adds, Abila (not <span class="accented">Abila</span> of Lysanias) and Kanata (distinct from <span class="accented">Kanatha</span>) . These towns, like the great maritime cities, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Joppa, and Caesarea Stratonis, were independent political communities, which - at least, after the time of Pompey - were never internally blended into an organic unity with the Jewish region, but were at most externally united with it under the same ruler" (Schurer, II. 1. p. 121).
