We return in this section to matter which resembles that of Mark and Luke, and undoubtedly belongs to the Framework (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction). St. Matthew has given a lengthy summary of the teaching of the Christ, and he now supplements it by a summary of his daily work. He is not concerned with the chronological connexion of the incidents here narrated, for this is evidently to him a matter of but secondary importance. He only desires to bring out different aspects of the Lord's life. Thus he notices - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Christ's miracles of healing, and the secret of his ability to perform them (vers. 1-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The personal trials that Christ incurred in his work (ver. 18-<a href="../../par/matthew/9-8.htm">Matthew 9:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The liberty of the gospel as shown by Christ's treatment of the outcast, and his answer to those who insisted on fasting (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9-17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The completeness of his healing power (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-34</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">Christ's miracles of healing</span>, <span class="accented">and the secret of his ability to perform them.</span> Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The variety in the patients. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> One of the chosen people, who had lost all social and religious privileges; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> a Gentile, an outsider by birth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the near relation of a personal follower; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> multitudes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The variety in the requests for his aid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The request by the sufferer; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the request by another; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> apparently no request, yet the personal follower has Christ with him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the sufferers are brought to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> <span class="accented">- Healing the leper.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-45</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12-16</a>.

It carries on the thought of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in the last verse of the preceding chapter, and serves to introduce the following examples of sick folk; or, perhaps, it may be connected with the "great multitudes" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) of <a href="../../par/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>, coming, as the plural suggests (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>) from the various places there enumerated. If we must combine this verse with <a href="../../par/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>, we must suppose our Lord to have descended the mountain, and to be passing through "one of the cities," coming (our ver. 5) afterwards to Capernaum, the "great multitudes" (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>)being drawn from the various cities through which he passed. The verse reminds us that the two sides of the Lord's life, preaching and work, were intimately connected. Men not only wondered at what they heard (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), they also followed him, and this led to occasions for the exercise of his practical activity. The result was that they wondered at his work (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>), as they wondered at his preaching. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>. In this case the unexpected (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, note) was the near approach (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), the "worship," and the prayer of an outcast. <span class="cmt_word">There came a leper</span>. Loathsome physically and typically. The other passages which speak of the healing of lepers by our Lord or the apostles are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>; parallel passage, <a href="../../par/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="../../par/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> perhaps <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And worshipped him</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-9.htm">Matthew 4:9</a>, note). From the parallel passages we may see that the word here refers more to the posture of his body than to the nature of his thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean</span>. Leprosy stood in so peculiar and solemn a relation to the Israelites that it would hardly be included under the terms, "all manner of disease, and all manner of sickness," in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23, 24</a>; we have therefore no evidence that up to this time any leper had been healed by our Lord. The man's utterance marks, therefore, a distinct advance in faith. None like him, the object of the Divine "stroke," had been healed; but from lesser examples of Jesus' power he argues to the greater. Sure of Jesus' power, he appeals to his heart. <span class="cmt_word">Make me clean</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Not merely "heal me;" for a leper could not but think of healing <span class="accented">and its consequences -</span> restoration to social and religious privileges (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean.

The careful record of the twofold action may be either a trace of the increasing astonishment of the bystanders or a means of indicating that this was no accidental touch, but the result of deliberate will (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>). According to the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a> with Leviticus 11:40), our Lord by this action would become unclean until the evening. But of this there is no hint. That indeed he could not by it contract any real impurity, or even any ceremonial impurity in the eyes of God, is self-evident. But how could he himself justify his exemption from the Law? and how could the people justify it? Probably both he and they felt that as "<span class="accented">the</span> priests, in their contact with the leper to be adjudged, were exempted from the law of defilement," much more was the One who "cleansed" him. "He says, <span class="accented">I will</span>,' to meet the heresy of Photinus. He <span class="accented">commands</span>, because of <span class="accented">Afius.</span> He <span class="accented">touches</span>, because of Manichseus" (Ambrose, in Ford). <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>).

The external power which the man had himself acknowledged was now applied to him, and he was made clean by it, physically and therefore ceremonially (cf. Bishop Westcott, on 'Hebrews,' p. 346). <span class="cmt_word">And immediately his leprosy was cleansed</span>. (On the parallel passage in Mark and Luke, "departed from him," see Professor Marshall, in <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, June, 1891, p. 464).

The Lord did not desire to be thronged with multitudes who came only to see his miracles; he would work in quiet (cf. the quotation from Isaiah in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But go thy way, show thyself to the priest.</span> The latter clause belongs verbally to <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-49.htm">Leviticus 13:49</a>, but the thought is that of <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> Without the official verdict, the man could not be restored to communal privileges (so also <a href="../../par/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And offer the gift that Moses commanded</span>.

Keil, 'Arch.,' &sect; 59; and for details of the traditional ceremonial, Edersheim, 'Temple,' pp. 315-318). <span class="cmt_word">For a testimony unto them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Although a fair sense might be extracted by connecting this clause with. the words, "Moses commanded," it would, especially in the parallel passages, be a very awkward addition to them. Rather it must represent the man's "offering" in its ultimate purpose, and this not necessarily in the man's own mind. So more clearly the "Western" reading in the parallel passage in Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. Whether "them" refers to the priests or to the nation generally is not of grave importance, for the priests themselves, in act and feeling, represented the nation (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>, note). Of more interest is the question  - What is that which is here testified of? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Prima facie</span> the man's own state. The performance of the rites would be legal evidence that he was clean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet this interpretation is hardly borne out by the usage of the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. (never closely with the dative as here) seems to always refer to that which is both permanent and important (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). And in the New Testament with the dative it elsewhere refers either to work for the Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>) or to a solemn judgment (<a href="../../par/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>). So probably here. The man's offering is to be a permanent testimony to the nation of our Lord's relation to the Law. His miracles confirmed his profession (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some, however, accepting the above view in the main, translate, "for a testimony against them" (as <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>, and as perhaps <a href="../../par/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, but <span class="accented">vide</span> Plumptre there); but it is unlikely that so harsh a thought towards the nation would be expressed by our Lord at this early stage of his ministry. In <a href="../../par/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a> there is a definite reason for its use. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-13.</span> <span class="accented">- The healing of the centurion's servant.</span> (Vers. 5-10; parallel passage <a href="../../par/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1-3, 6-10</a>. Vers. 11, 12, equivalent to <a href="../../par/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28, 29</a>.) According to St. Luke, the centurion sent first elders of the Jews to plead for him, and afterwards friends, and expressly said by them that he did not think himself worthy to come to Jesus. Their return in ver. 10 seems to forbid the supposition that he eventually came. This detailed narrative seems more likely than St. Matthew's, which is not only compressed, but, if taken by itself, gives a wrong idea of what appears to have actually taken place. But <span class="accented">quod tacit per alium facit per se</span>, and as Trench points out, this is "an exchange of persons, of which all historical narrative and all the language of our common life is full. A comparison of <a href="../../par/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a> with ch. 20:20 will furnish another example of the same." The fact is that St. Matthew (or, perhaps, the original framer of the source that he used, or those through whose hands it passed) seizes on the Gentilic origin of the centurion, without troubling himself to record his previous kind and generous attitude towards the Jews, and the interest that they now show on his behalf. This led to the omission of the second group of messengers also, and, of course, to the modification of the language where necessary, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 13. For the same reason, St. Matthew records vers. 11, 12 in this place. For the contrast between this and the superficially similar miracle recorded in <a href="../../par/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, cf. Trench on that miracle. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">he</span>) was entered into Capernaum.

The centurion probably belonged to the soldiers of Antipas, in whose district Capernaum lay. They would naturally be organized after the Roman manner; of the forces of the Indian native states and our own. It should be observed, by the way, that even the imperial troops stationed in Palestine were drawn, not from distant lands, but from the non-Jewish inhabitants of the country, perhaps especially from Samaritans (<span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, I. 2. p. 50).

St. Matthew in this verse calls attention to two points. First, that prophecy had foretold that Christ would heal the sick. For this he might have adduced <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>, and similar passages; but as one verse will serve his double purpose, he prefers it. Secondly, that the method by which Christ did this was specially noteworthy. He did not perform miracles by magic (as is commonly asserted of him in the Talmud; cf. Laible, 'Jesus Christ in Talmud,' p. 44: Berlin, 1891),nor by the power of God exerted as it were externally on his behalf, nor by his own inherent Divine power, but by himself bearing the sicknesses that he removed. He wrought his miracles at his own expense,and that expense the greatest. The thought is far-reaching, and implies both that he bore the ultimate cause of sickness, the sin of the world (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), and also that each miracle of healing meant for him a fresh realization of what bearing the sin of the world included. In other words, the passage in Isaiah, as interpreted by St. Matthew, refers, not only to the Passion as such, but also to Christ's suffering an earnest and a foretaste of it at each miracle. May not this have been in part the cause of his sigh at one miracle (<a href="../../par/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>), and his deep emotion at another (<a href="../../par/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>)? Observe that this may be the complementary side of his experience recorded in <a href="../../par/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a> (parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>), that "power" went out of him. A miracle of healing, though performed in momentary unconsciousness of what was taking place, still necessitated personal contact with sin, which to Christ's whole nature meant moral effort. The utterance recorded by Origen, "For those that are sick! was sick, and' for those that hunger I suffered hunger, and for those that thirst I suffered thirst" (Bishop Westcott, 'Introd.,' Appendix C; Resch, 'Agmpha,' Log. 47), probably expresses the same thought as our verse, though in the language of <a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35, 36</a>. A similar idea seems to underlie the well-known saying of Talm. Bab., 'Sanh.,' 98b, with reference to Messiah, "The Leper of the house of Rabbi is his name; for it is said, 'Surely he hath berne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.'"

The original phrase, "one like unto a son of man," was used in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, apparently as a symbol of the Jewish nation, to which was to be given supreme power. There is no evidence that it was understood of Messiah before our Lord employed it, but rather the re verse (cf.

Our Lord uses it here for the sake of the contrast it suggested to the lower creation. Man, the head of creation (as none would acknowledge more fully than this student of the Law), has in the person of the ideal Man not even the luxuries which correspond to those enjoyed by beasts and birds.

His heart told him that he ought to go, but he asks for a delay, and, in fact, a real difficulty seems to hinder him from going.

The paradox was self-interpreting. Let the spiritually dead have to do with death; dead men belong in a special sense to them. Observe that there was no danger of his father remaining unburied. Christ means that there are times when his service admits of no postponement, however sacred the conflicting duty. His followers must on such occasions be very Nazarites (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a>) or high priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>).

But in our present knowledge of the extent of inspiration, we cannot confidently affirm that the evangelists were kept from errors in numbers, and that the addition of the second demoniac is not due' to some misunderstanding, perhaps of the use of the plural in the demoniac's answer in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a> (cf. Weiss, 'Marcus-ev.,' p. 172). (For a similar difficulty, cf. the note on Matthew 9:27-31.)

The lake is so near the base of the mountain that the swine, rushing madly down it, could not stop, but would be hurried on into the water and drowned." To this Origen's  description (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) corresponds: "Gergesa, to which the Gergesenes belong, is an ancient city by what is now called the Lake of Tiberias, by which is a steep place adjacent to the lake, and down this, as is pointed out, the swine were cast headlong by the demons." Gadara, in some sense the capital of Peraea (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:07. 3), and one of the towns of the Decapolis confederacy (ch. 4:25), was some twelve miles distant from <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, and six miles from the nearest part of the lake, to which, in fact (as the stamp of a ship on its coins shows), its territory extended (cf. Schiirer, II. 1. p. 100, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). St. Matthew describes the locality, not by the little-known village, but by the well-known city of the district, to which (as we may gather from the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>) the news of the miracle afterwards spread. But since he leaves the expression, "the city," in vers. 33, 34 as he fontal it in his sources, <span class="accented">i.e. Khersa</span>, the result is at first misleading <span class="cmt_word">There met him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">occurrerunt</span>, Vulgate). St. Matthew (contrast vers. 2, 5, 19) omits the nearer approach recorded in the parallel passages, <a href="../../par/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Two</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Possessed with devils</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">coming out of the tombs;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">coming forth out.</span> The Greek shows that they did not merely come from among the tombs, but actually out of them (cf. the experience of Warburton, as quoted in Trench on this miracle).

These Gerasenes, vexed at the loss of wealth, felt, like the demoniacs, that there was nothing in common between themselves and Jesus, but, unlike them, showed no consciousness of sin. Without this he could do nothing for them, so he granted their request (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>). St. Peter also once bade Jesus depart (<a href="../../par/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>), but his reason, "for I am a sinful man, O Lord," showed a heartfelt desire after the deepest union with him. With the ungranted request of the man to remain with Jesus, and his subsequent preaching to these Gerasenes and others (parallel passages), St. Matthew does not concern himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
