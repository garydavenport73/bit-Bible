Ascending from the south, we followed a wild, narrow wady overhung by trees, bushes, and tangled creepers, through which my guide thought we could get up to the top; but it became absolutely impracticable, and we were obliged to find our way back again. And even after we reached the summit, it was so rough and broken in some places, and the thorn bushes so thickset and sharp, that our clothes were torn and our hands and faces severely lacerated; nor could I see my guide at times ten steps ahead of me.

Under the figure of a supernatural fertility are represented the victories of grace (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 34:25, etc.). The blessing is founded on the Mosaic promise (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ploughman shall overtake the reaper.</span> Ploughing and harvest shall be continuous, without sensible interval. <span class="cmt_word">The treader of grapes him that soweth seed.</span> The vintage should be so abundant that it should last till sowing time. <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall drop sweet wine.</span> This is from <a href="../../par/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And all the hills shall melt.</span> As Joel says, "shall flow with milk," in this promised land "flowing with milk and honey."

For, as Corn. a Lapide quotes, "Bacchus amat colles" (Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:113). The hyperbolical expressions in the text are not to be taken literally; they depict in bright colours the blessings of the kingdom of Messiah. Material and temporal blessings are generally represented as closely connected with spiritual, and as figurative of them. Such predictions, understood literally, are common in the so called Sibylline Books; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> lib. 3:743, etc., where, among other prodigies, we have - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> One is reminded of the golden age depicted by Virgil in his fourth eclogue. Trochon cites Claudian, 'In Rufin.,' 1:381, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"... nec vomere sulcus adunco<br />Findetur; subitis messor gaudebit aristis.<br />Rorabunt querceta favis; stagnantia passim<br />Vina fluent, oleique lacus."</span>
