St. Jerome identifies it with Ctesiphon, on the east bank of the Tigris.

This was the principal city of Upper Syria, and a place of great importance. In after years it was called Epiphania, after Antiochus Epiphanes (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>).

The site is placed by Porter at <span class="accented">Tell-es-Safi</span>, an isolated hill; standing above the bread valley of Elah, and "presenting on the north and west a white precipice of many hundred feet." Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 215, etc.) considers Gath to be the same city as Betogabra, Eleutheropolis, and the modern <span class="accented">Beth Jibrin</span>, which is some few miles south of <span class="accented">Tell Safi</span>. He thinks the site of Tell Sift is not adapted for the seat of a large city, and he saw few indications of ancient ruins there; whereas Beit Jibrin has in and around it the most wonderful remains of antiquity to be found in all Philistia. It had probably declined in importance at this time (see note on ch. 1:6), but its old reputation was still remembered. It was taken by Uzziah, but seems not to have remained long in his possession (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). In the year  <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon reduced Ashdod and Garb, which he calls Gimtu Asdudim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Gath of the Ashdodites. <span class="cmt_word">Be they better?</span> Have they received more earthly prosperity at God's hands than you?

Schrader and Bickell regard the verse as an interpolation, grammatically, metrically, and chronologically inadmissible; but their arguments are not strong, and Ames makes no mention of the fate of these cities.

This is the same person as the kinsman. the butler; but tot some reason, either from the number of deaths, or from the pestilence, or from the distance of the burying place, which would be out of the city and inaccessible in the blockade, he cannot lay the body in the brave, and is forced to take and burn it. Though the Jews generally buried dead bodies, cremation was sometimes used, both in honour or emergency (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) and in punishment (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The bones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the corpse, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; and <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>; Keil. The kinsman takes it up to bring it out of the house to burn it. <span class="cmt_word">Him that is by the sides of the house;</span> <span class="accented">him that is in the innermost parts of the house</span>; <span class="accented">qui in penetralibus domus est</span> (Vulgate). This is the last living person, who had hidden himself in the most remote chambers; or it may be a messenger whom the kinsman had sent to search the house. He asks him - Is there yet any with thee? Is there any one left alive to succour, or dead to bury? <span class="cmt_word">And he shall say, No;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">et respondebit, Finis est. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Then he</span> (the kinsman) <span class="cmt_word">shall say, Hold thy tongue</span> (<span class="accented">Has!</span>); <span class="accented">Hush!</span> He stays the man in the inner chamber from speaking; and why? <span class="cmt_word">For we may not make mention of the name of the Lord;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">et non</span> <span class="accented">recorderis nominis Domini.</span> Some, as Pussy, Schegg, and Gandell, see here the voice of despair. It is too late to call upon God now; it is the time of vengeance. We rejected him in life; we may not cry to him in death. St. Jerome refers the prohibition to the hardness of heart and unbelief of the people, who even in all this misery will not confess the name of the Lord. Keil says, "It indicates a fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, his eye should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death." Others again think that the notion in the mind of the impious speaker is that Jehovah is the Author of all their calamities, and that he is impatient at the very mention of his name. The simplest explanation is the first, or a modification of it The person addressed is about to pray or to call on God in his distress. "Be silent," says the speaker; "we can no longer appeal to Jehovah as the covenant God; by naming him we call to his remembrance how we have broken the covenant, violated our relation to him; therefore provoke him not further by making mention of his name."

All houses, great and small, shall be smitten. Possibly Israel and Judah are signified respectively by "the great house" and "the little house" (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>);  and their treatment by the Assyrians may be thus symbolized.

The answer, of course, is "No." Yet your conduct is equally foolish, your labour is equally lost. Some, dividing the words differently, translate, "Does one plough the sea with oxen?" which reminds one of the Latin proverb, "Litus arare bubus." Thus Ovid, 'Ep. Heroid,' 5:115 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Quid facis OEnone?

Some plant with an acrid juice. Ye turn the administration of justice, which is "the fruit of righteousness," into the bitterest injustice and wrong. It were "more easy," says Pusey, "to change the course of nature or the use of things of nature, than the course of God's providence or the laws of his just retribution."
