Nothing more is known of Tola than what is here told us, viz., his name, his parentage, his dwelling-place, his office, the length of time which he held it, and the place of his burial. Who were the enemies from whom Tola was raised up to save Israel we are not told. There was probably no great invasion or grievous servitude, but perhaps frequent border wars requiring an able and watchful chief to maintain the independence of Israel. Tola and Puah (otherwise written Puvah) were both names of families in Issachar (Genesis 46:13; Numbers 26:23). Shamir in mount Ephraim, to distinguish it from Shamir in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:48). Both are otherwise unknown.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Jair. We read of Jair the son of Segub, the son of Machir's daughter by Hezron, in 1 Chronicles 2:21-23, and are there told that he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (called Havoth-jair), which were included in the territory of the sons of Machir. The same information is given in Numbers 32:40-42, and in Deuteronomy 3:14, 15, in both which passages Jair is styled the son of Manasseh, and is stated to have called the cities after his own name, Havoth-jair. In the present verse we are also told that Jair the judge was a Gileadite, and that he had thirty sons who had thirty cities in Gilead called Havoth-jair. The question arises, Can these two be the same person? If they are, Deuteronomy 3:14 must be a later parenthetical insertion, as it has very much the appearance of being. The notice in Numbers 32:41 must also refer to later times than those of Moses, and we must understand the statement in 1 Chronicles 2:22, that \"Segub begat Jair,\" as meaning that he was his lineal ancestor, just as in Matthew 1:8 we read that \"Joram begat Ozias,\" though three generations intervened between them. If, on the other hand, they are not the same, we must suppose that Jair in our text was a descendant of the other Jair, and may compare the double explanation of the name Havoth-jair with the double explanation of Beer-sheba given Genesis 21:31; Genesis 26:31-33; the threefold explanation of the name Isaac, Genesis 17:17; Genesis 18:12; Genesis 21:6; and the double explanation of the proverb, \"Is Saul among the prophets?\" given in 1 Samuel 10:11, 12; 1 Samuel 19:23, 24. The Hebrew name Jair is preserved in the New Testament under the Greek form of Jairus (Mark 5:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thirty ass colts. The number and dignity of these knightly sons of Jair shows that Jair himself, like Gideon (Judges 8:30), assumed the state of a prince. The word in Hebrew for ass colts is identical with that for cities, as here pointed, and this play upon the words belongs to the same turn of mind as produced Jotham s fable and Samson's riddle (Judges 14:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jair died, and was buried in Camon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Jair... was buried in Careen. A city of Gilead according to Josephus, and probability. Polybius mentions a Camoun among other trans-Jordanic places, but its site has not been verified by modern research. Eusebius and Jerome place it in the plain of Esdraelon, but without probability. The careful mention of the place of sepulture of the judges and kings is remarkable, beginning with Gideon (Judges 8:32; Judges 10:2, 5; Judges 12:9, 10, 12, 15; Judges 16:31; 1 Samuel 31:12; 2 Samuel 2:10, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:6-18NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Did evil again. We may conclude that Tola and Jair had used their influence to maintain the worship of Jehovah; but at their death idolatry broke out with more virulence than ever. Not only were the many altars of Baal and Ashtoreth honoured, as in former times, but new forms of idol-worship, according to the rites of all the neighbouring nations, were introduced among them. The gods of Syria, i.e. Aram, who are not usually named, but whose worship is spoken of (2 Chronicles 28:23), and whose altar attracted the attention of Ahaz (2 Kings 16:10), and one of whom was Rimmon (2 Kings 5:18); the gods of the Zidonians, Baal and Ashtoreth, probably with rites somewhat differing from those of Canaan; Chemosh, the god of the Moabites; Milcom or Moloch, the god of the children of Ammon; and Dagon, the god of the Philis-tines - all were worshipped, while the service of Jehovah was thrust aside (see 1 Kings 11:5-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The anger of the Lord, etc. See Judges 2:13, 14. Into the hands of the Philistines. Probably the same Philistine domination as is described more fully in the history of the judgeship of Samson (chs. 13-16.). But now the writer confines his attention first to the oppression of the Ammonites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - That year. It does not appear clearly what particular year is meant. Jarchi explains it as the year in which air died. It may mean the very year in which the idolatries spoken of in ver. 6 were set up, so as to mark how closely God's chastisement followed the apostasy from him. They, i.e. the children of Ammon. Eighteen years. The same length as that of the Moabite servitude (Judges 3:18). The land of the Amorites, i.e. the territory of Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan (Numbers 32:33). In Gilead - in its widest acceptation, including, as in Deuteronomy 34:1; Joshua 22:9, 13, 15; Judges 20:1, the whole country held by the Amorites on the east of Jordan, and given to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. But in its narrower and stricter sense Gilead was bounded on the north by Bashan proper, and on the south by the Mishor, or plain of Medeba, which lay between the valley of Heshbon and the river Arnon, thus excluding that part of the territory of Reuben from Gilead (see Joshua 13:9-11). Originally, as we learn from Judges 11:13-22, the territory bounded by the Arnon on the south, by the Jabbok on the north, by the wilderness on the east, and by the Jordan on the west, had belonged to Moab, but the Amorites had taken it from them before the conquest of Sihon by the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The children of Ammon, etc. It would seem that at this time the king of the children of Ammon was also king of the Moabites, since he laid claim (Judges 11:13, 24) to the land which had once belonged to Moab. If we may trust the king of the Ammonites' statement, the object of the war was to recover that land, and he carried the war across the Jordan into the territory of Judah and Ephraim in order to compel the Israelites to give it up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Did not I deliver you, etc. These references to former deliverances are of great historical value, and not the least so as they allude to events of which the existing records give no account, or a very imperfect one. They show the existence of a real history in the background of that which has been preserved in the Bible (see Judges 8:13, note). From the Egyptians, as related at large in the Book of Exodus; from the Amorites, as related in Numbers 21:21-35; from the children of Ammon, who were confederate with the Moabites under Ehud, as we learn from Judges 3:13; from the Philistines, as is briefly recorded in Judges 3:31.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The Zidonians also. This allusion is not clear; it may mean the subjects of Jabin king of Canaan, as the northern Canaanites are called Zidonians in ch. 18:7; and this agrees with the order in which the deliverance from the Zidonians is here mentioned, next to that from the Philistines, and would be strengthened by the conjecture that has been made, that Harosheth (Judges 4:2) was the great workshop in which the tributary Israelites wrought in cutting down timber, etc. for the Phoenician ships; or it may allude to some unrecorded oppression. The Amalekites, who were in alliance with the Midianites (Judges 6:3, 33), as previously with the Moabites (Judges 3:13) and with the Canaanites (Judges 4:14), and whose signal defeat seems to have given the name to the mount of the Amalekites (Judges 12:15). The Maonites. It is thought by many that the true reading is that preserved in the Septuagint, viz., the Midianites, which, being the greatest of all the foes of Israel, could scarcely be omitted here (see chs. 6, 7, 8.). If Maonites or Maon is the true reading, they would be the same people as the Mehunim, mentioned 2 Chronicles 26:7 (Maon, sing., and Meunim, plur.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And they put away the strange gods. Here at length were \"the fruits meet for repentance,\" and \"the returning to the Lord their God;\" the intended result of the severe but loving correction (see Homiletics, Judges 6:25-32). Cf. Genesis 35:2; 1 Samuel 7:3, in which passages, as here, the phrase the strange gods is the correct rendering; not, as in the margin, gods of strangers. The Hebrew phrase here rendered his soul was grieved occurs Numbers 21:4; Judges 16:16; Zechariah 11:2; it means was impatient - literally, was shortened, i.e. he could bear it no longer. A somewhat similar description of the Divine relenting is contained in the beautiful passage Hosea 11:7-9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This verse ought to begin the new chapter. The preliminary matter of Israel's sin, of their oppression by the Ammonites, of their repentance and return to the God of their fathers, and of God's merciful acceptance of their penitence and prayer, was concluded in the last verse. The history of their deliverance by Jephthah begins here. And the children of Ammon, etc., i.e. they encamped, as they had done during the previous seventeen years, in Gilead, either to carry off the crops or to wring tribute from the people, or in some other way to oppress them, expecting no doubt to meet with tame submission as before. But a new spirit was aroused among the Israelites. By whatever channel the bitter reproach in vers. 11-14 had been convey. ed to them, probably by the same channel, whether angel, or prophet, or high priest, had an answer of peace come to them on their repentance, and so they were roused and encouraged to resistance. As a first step, they encamped in Mizpeh (see Judges 11:11, 29, 34). Mizpeh, or Mizpah of Gilead, is probably the same as Mizpah in Gilead where Laban and Jacob parted (Genesis 31:25, 49); as Ramoth-Mizpeh (Joshua 13:26), called simply Ramoth in Gilead (Joshua 20:8; 1 Chronicles 6:80); and as the place well known in later Israelite history as Ramoth-Gilead (1 Kings 4:13; 1 Kings 22:3, 6), situated in the tribe of Gad, and a strong place of much importance. It was the place of national meeting for the whole of Gilead. Mizpah means the watch-tower, and would of course be upon a height, as the name Ramoth-Mizpeh, the heights of Mizpeh, also shows. It almost always preserves its meaning as an appellative, having the article prefixed, ham-mizpah, which is its usual form; only once ham-mizpeh (Joshua 15:38), and Mizpeh (Joshua 11:18; Judges 11:29; 1 Samuel 22:3), and once Mizpah (Hosea 5:1). Whether Mizpeh in Judges 20:1-3 is the same will be considered in the note to that passage. The modern site is not identified with certainty; it is thought to be es-Salt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Gilead. See note to ver. 8. The people and princes. There is no and in the Hebrew. It is perhaps better, therefore, to take the words in apposition, as meaning, And the assembly of the chiefs of Gilead. The first step was to find a competent leader, and they agreed to appoint such an one, if he could be found, as their permanent head and captain.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jephthah the Gileadite. Gilead has two meanings: it is the name of the country so called (Judges 10:8, note), and it is the name of the son or descendant of Machir the son of Manasseh (1 Chronicles 7:14, 17; Numbers 26:29, 30). Gileadite also may be explained in two ways: it may mean an inhabitant of Gilead (Judges 10:18), or it may mean a member of the family of the Gileadites, either an actual son or a more remote descendant of Gilead (Numbers 26:29) - two meanings which would usually coincide. Gilead begat Jephthah. Here Gilead must mean the person so called, i.e. the son or descendant of Machir, from whom the family, including Jephthah, were called Gileadites; but whether son or descendant cannot positively be affirmed. All that is certain is that he was that one of Maehir's descendants who was the head of that division of the Manassites who were called Gileadites. Again, when it is said Gilead begat Jephthah, we cannot be certain whether it is meant that Gilead was Jephthah's father, or merely his ancestor (see Judges 10:3, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Gilead's wife. Whenever Gilead lived, besides the son by the foreign harlot, whom Jephthah represented, he had sons and descendants by his legitimate wife, who claimed to be his sole heirs, and who therefore drove Jephthah from the inheritance of their father's house. They might, as far as the language used is concerned, have been Gilead's own sons, or they may have been his grandsons or great-grandsons, and so either the brothers or the cousins and fellow-tribesmen of Jephthah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The land of Tob. This is certainly the same country as is spoken of in Ish-tob, i.e. the men of Tob, of whom 12,000 were hired by the children of Ammon to fight against David. They are thus named side by side with the men of Beth-Rehob, and Zoba, and Maacah, other small Aramean or Syrian states (2 Samuel 10:6, 8). Tob is again mentioned in all probability in 1 Macc. 5:13; 2 Macc. 12:17, and the Thauba of Ptolemy agrees in situation as well as in name with Tob, but no identification with any existing place has been hitherto effected. Vain men, as in Judges 9:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This verse brings us back to Judges 10:17, and reunites the two streams of narrative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The elders of Gilead. The same as the princes in Judges 10:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Our captain. A military term, as in Joshua 10:24. It is also used in Isaiah 1:10 for the rulers of Sodom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Did not ye hate me, etc. Jephthah's reproach to the \"elders of Gilead\" strongly favours the idea that \"his brethren\" in ver. 3, and the \"father's house\" in ver. 2, are to be taken in the wider sense of fellow-tribesmen and \"house of fathers,\" and that his expulsion was not the private act of his own brothers training him out of the house they lived in, but a tribal act (taking tribe in the sense of house of fathers), in which the elders of Gilead bad taken a part. If this is so, it removes a great difficulty about Jephthah being Gilead's son, which it is very hard to reconcile with chronology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Shall I be, etc. There is no interrogative in the Hebrew. The words may be taken as the laying down of the condition by Jephthah, to which in the following verse the elders express their assent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Head and captain. Both civil ruler or judge, and military chief. Uttered all his words before the Lord. The expression \"before the Lord\" is used in Exodus 34:34; Leviticus 1:3; Judges 21:2 (before God), and elsewhere, to signify the special presence of the Lord which was to be found in the tabernacle, or with the ark, or where there was the priest with an ephod. And this must be the meaning of the expression here. Jephthah was installed at the national place of gathering and consultation for Gilead, viz., at Mizpah in Gilead, into his office as bead of the State, and there, as in the capital, he performed all his duties under the sanctions of religion. Whether, however, the ark was brought there, or the altar, or a priest with an ephod, or whether some substitute was devised which the unsettled times might justify, it is impossible to say from want of information. There seems to be some reference in the words to Jephthah's vow, in ver. 31, as one of such utterances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And Jephthah sent, etc. His first attempt was to make an honourable peace by showing that there was no just cause of quarrel. What hast thou to do with me? or, rather, What business, what cause of quarrel, is there between you and me? (he speaks in the name of Israel, as head of the State) what is it all about?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And the king, etc. The Ammonite king stated his ground of quarrel very distinctly. He claimed the land between the Amen and the Jabbok as Ammonitish or Moabitish territory, and demanded its surrender as the only condition of peace. It appears from Joshua 13:25 that part of the land of the tribe of Gad, that, namely, \"on the western side of the upper Jabbok,\" had once belonged to the Ammonites, but had been conquered by the Amorites, from whom Israel took it, together with that which had formerly belonged to the Moabites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When Israel came up, etc. In this and the following verses there is a distinct reference to the history in Numbers and Deuteronomy, and in some instances verbal quotations. Thus in this verse the words below which are put in italics are found in Numbers 13:26; Numbers 14:25: Israel... walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.

Numbers 20:17). The words in italics are found in Numbers 20:14, 17. And Israel abode in Kadesh. These words are in Numbers 20:1; see also Deuteronomy 1:46. The king of Edom would not hearken. This is related in substance in Numbers 20:18-21. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab. There is no mention of this in the Mosaic narrative. The knowledge of it must have been preserved either by tradition or in some other now lost writings; perhaps in the Book of the Wars of the Lord (Numbers 21:14). It is in itself very probable that such a message should have been sent to the king of Moab, whose territories Israel was forbidden to meddle with (Deuteronomy 2:9, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Then they went along, etc. The narrative here follows Deuteronomy 2:1. For they compassed the land of Edom. Deuteronomy 2:1 has, \"we compassed Mount Seir;\" but Numbers 21:4 has, \"to compass the land of Edom.\" By the east side - literally, by the sun-rising side, as in Numbers 21:11. They pitched on the other side of Arnon. The identical words occur in Numbers 21:13. For Arnon was the border of Moab. The identical words of Numbers 21:18, where it is added, \"between Moab and the Amorites.\" South of the Amen belonged to Moab, and north to the Amorites. The route taken by the Israelites is carefully traced (Numbers 21:11-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And Israel, etc. The text here follows Numbers 21:21-24 almost verbatim; but the expression, \"the king of Heshbon,\" is from Deuteronomy 2:24, 26, 80.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In Jahaz.

Cf. also Deuteronomy 2:33-36. The wilderness is the country lying east of Moab up to the hill country (see Judges 10:8, note). From the Amen to the Jabbok is the measurement from south to north; from the wilderness to the Jordan, from east to west.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess?

Numbers 21:29; 1 Kings 11:7, 33; Jeremiah 48:7, 13, 46, etc.). Thy god. The phrase indicates a very close connection between Moab and Ammon at the present time, both possibly being under one king. Chemosh, rather than Moloch, is mentioned because the territory had belonged to the Moabites, but Chemosh had not been able to save it from the Amorites. The Lord our God. Jehovah was the God of Israel as truly as Chemosh was the god of Moab, in one sense. Possibly Jephthah had not risen to the conception of Jehovah as the God of the whole earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Art thou anything better, etc. Jephthah now advances another argument to prove the justice of his cause and the unreasonableness of the Ammonite claim. If the territory in question was Moabite property, bow came it that Balak laid no claim to it? He was an enemy of the Israelites, and yet when Israel took possession of the land, and dwelt in Heshbon, its capital, and the daughter cities or villages thereof, and in Aroer and her daughter cities or villages, and in all the cities on the banks of the Amen, Balak never strove about them with Israel, or went to war to recover them - a plain proof that he did not look upon them as his property. If they were his, that was the time to claim and recover them, but he had not done so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The occupation of the cities and villages referred to is related in Numbers 21:23 and following verses, and in Deuteronomy 2:36; see too Joshua 12:2. Aroer is not mentioned among the cities of Moab taken by the Amorites in the ancient book quoted in Numbers 21:27-80, and it has been conjectured that it may have been built by the Amorites to secure their new frontier. It is described by Eusebius and Jerome in the 'Onomasticon' as built on a hill overhanging the bank of the Amen, and a ruin called Arair has been foBy the coasts of Arnon, i.e. on the banks. The Septuagint for Arnon reads Jordan, which was the western boundary, as Arnon was the southern (ver. 22). The corresponding description in Deuteronomy 2:36 is, From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead:, there was not owe city too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us. Three hundred years. These words seem quite unintelligible and out of place. They are also chronologically impracticable. One expects the number of the cities, as in ver. 33, rather than the number of years; and it is remarkable that the whole number of cities taken by the Israelites on the east of Jordan must have been just about 300, since the half-tribe of Manasseh had sixty. If Gad and Reuben had the same proportion, it would be exactly 300 (5 × 60). Within that time. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs about seventy times, invariably means at that time, and here can only refer to the time of the first settlement in the days of Balak, of which he had been speaking - another proof that the enumeration three hundred years is out of place here. If the reading years is not, as above suggested, an error for cities, the whole sentence, three hundred years, may very probably be an interpolation by a professed chronologist. The adding up of all the numbers of the servitudes and rests given in the book gives 301 years from the commencement of the oppression by Chushan-rishathaim to the death of Jair. But this method of reckoning gives the impossible period of 600 years from the exodus to the building of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Jephthah now asserts his own entire blamelessness, and appeals to the justice of God to decide between him and the Ammonites.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 11:29-40NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, as upon Othniel, upon Gideon, and upon Samson (Judges 3:16; Judges 6:34; Judges 13:25; Judges 14:19; Judges 15:14). He passed over, i.e. he went all through, Gilead, and Manasseh, - for the purpose, no doubt, of collecting forces, - and passed over Mizpeh. It should be to Mizpeh. Mizpeh was the capital and mustering place of his army, and his base of operations (Judges 10:17; Judges 11:11, note). Having organised his forces at Mizpeh of Gilead, he passed over to the children of Ammon, i.e. commenced his attack upon the invaders, as it is stated in ver. 32, which takes up the thread of the narrative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - And Jephthah vowed a vow. This verse and the following go back to relate something which preceded his passing over to the children of Ammon, viz., his rash and unhappy vow. This is related, as so many things in Scripture are, without note or comment, and the reader must pass his own sentence upon the deed. That sentence can only be one of unreserved con- detonation on the part of any one acquainted with the spirit and letter of the word of God. Many attempts have been made to show that Jephthah only contemplated the offering of an animal in sacrifice; but the natural and indeed necessary interpretation of the words shows that he had a human victim in mind. He could not expect any but a human being to come forth from the doors of his house, nor could any but a human being come forth \"to meet him\" - a common phrase always spoken of men (Genesis 14:17; Genesis 24:65; Exodus 4:14; Exodus 18:7; Numbers 20:20; 1 Samuel 25:34, etc., and below in ver. 34). Obviously, in the greatness of his danger and the extreme hazard of his undertaking (Judges 12:3), he thought to propitiate God's favour by a terrible and extraordinary vow. But if we ask how Jephthah came to have such erroneous notions of the character of God, the answer is not far to seek. Jephthah was \"the son of a strange woman,\" probably, as we have seen, a Syrian (Judges 11:1-11, note), and had passed many years of his life as an exile in Syria. Now it is well known that human sacrifices were frequently practised in Syria, as they were also by the Ammonites, who made their children pass through the fire to Moloch, and it cannot surprise us that a man brought up as Jephthah was, and leading the life of a freebooter at the head of a band of Syrian outlaws, should have the common Syrian notion of the efficacy of human sacrifices in great emergencies. His language, indeed, about Jehovah and Chemosh in ver. 24 savoured of semi-heathenism. Nor is it any valid objection that we are told in ver. 29 that \"the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah.\" The phrase does not mean that thenceforth he was altogether under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, so that all that he did was inspired by the Spirit of truth and wisdom, but that the Spirit of the Lord inspired him with extraordinary strength and power for the great task of leading Israel to battle against the Ammonites. And I will offer. The rendering suggested by some, or I will offer, meaning, if the first. comer is a human being he shall be the Lord's, or if it is an animal I will offer it as a burnt offering, is wholly inadmissible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - So Jephthah. The narrator takes up again the thread of the narrative, which was interrupted at ver. 29, the words he passed over up, to the children of Ammon being repeated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - From Aroer... to Minnith. The Aroer here mentioned seems to be that in the tribe of Gad (Numbers 32:34; Joshua 13:25), now Nahr Amman. Minnith is thought to have been situated four Roman miles from Heshbon, on the road to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, afterwards called Philadelphia. It was called Manith in the time of Eusebius. The plain of the vineyards, better taken as a proper name, Abel-ceramim. The site is not certainly known. Eusebius speaks of two Abels, both fertile in vineyards, one seven Roman miles from Rabbah, which is probably the one here meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - To his house. Soever. 11. His only child (Je'hid) - the same term as is applied to Isaac (Genesis 22:2). Eusebius says that Cronus sacrificed his only son, who on that account was called Jeoud, which in the Phoenician tongue means an only son ('Prep. Evang.,' 4:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Thou hast brought me very low - literally, thou hast thoroughly bowed me down, i.e. with sorrow. I cannot go back. A forcible illustration of the evil of rash vows. He who makes them is so placed that he must sin. If he breaks his vow, he has taken God's name in vain; if he keeps it, he breaks one of God's commandments. So it was with Saul (1 Samuel 14:24, 39-45), with Herod (Mark 6:23); so it has often been since with those who have made unauthorised vows, and who in attempting to keep them have fallen into deadly sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - My father, etc. See Numbers 32:2. The touching submission of Jephthah's daughter to her unnatural and terrible fate, while it reveals a most lovable character, seems also to show that the idea of a human sacrifice was not so strange to her mind as it is to ours. The sacrifice of his eldest son as a burnt offering by the king of Moab, some 300 years later, as related 2 Kings 3:27; the intended sacrifices of Iphigenia and of Phrixus in Greek mythology; the sacrifices of children to Moloch, so often spoken of in Scripture; the question in Micah 6:7, \"Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\" the Phoenician custom mentioned by Sanchoniatho (quoted by Porphyry), of sacrificing to Saturn one of those most dear to them in times of war, pestilence, or drought; the yearly sacrifice at Carthage of a boy chosen by lot ('Sil. Italicus,' 4, 765), and many other examples, prove the prevalence of human sacrifices in early times, and in heathen lands. This must be borne in mind in reading the history of Jephthah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And bewail my virginity. It is a striking evidence of the strong desire among Hebrew women to be mothers, as seen in Sarah, Rachel, Hannah, and others, that it was the prospect of dying unmarried which seemed to Jephthah's daughter the saddest part of her fate. So in Psalm 78:63, their maidens were not given to marriage is one of the items of the misery of Israel (see too ver. 39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Who did with her according to his vow. Nothing can be more express than this statement. In fact, except the natural horror we feel at a human sacrifice, there is nothing to cast the least shade of doubt upon the fact that Jephthah's daughter was offered up as a burnt offering, in accordance with heathen notions, but, as Josephus says, neither \"conformably to the law, nor acceptably to God.\" Most of the early Jewish commentators and all the Christian Fathers for ten or eleven centuries (Origen, Chrysostom, Theo-doret, Jerome, Augustine, etc.) held this view. Luther's comment is, \"Some affirm that he did not sacrifice her, but the text is clear enough.\" She knew. Rather, she had known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges11:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - The daughters of Israel, etc. No other trace of this custom, which was probably confined to Gilead, remains. To lament. The word rather means to praise, or celebrate, as in Judges 5:11 (rehearse).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Northward, or, otherwise rendered, to Zaphon, a city of the Gadites mentioned in Joshua 13:27 together with Succoth, and thought to be the modern, Amateh on the Wady Rajlb (see Vanderveld's map). It is difficult to say with certainty which rendering is right, but on the whole the latter seems most probable. Although Gilead does lie north-east of Ephraim, it hardly seems a natural description of the Ephraimite movement to say they \"went northwards;\" whereas if they marched to Zaphon the phrase would be precise. The previous phrase, gathered themselves together, means mustered for battle, as in Judges 7:23, 24. We will burn thine house, etc. - the same savage threat as the Philistine youths made use of to induce Samson's wife to discover and reveal his riddle (Judges 14:15), and as the Philistines actually put in practice upon her and her father in revenge for the destruction of their corn (Judges 15:6).

This incident is not mentioned in the previous narrative. Probably Jephthah asked the help of Ephraim when he was first made chief of the Gileadites, and they refused partly because they thought the attempt desperate, and partly because they were offended at Jephthah's leadership.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The English version of these somewhat obscure verses is obviously wrong, and devoid of sense. The obscurity arises partly from verses 5 and 6 being merely an amplification, i.e. a narrative in detail of what is more briefly related in ver. 4; and from the insertion of the explanatory words, \"Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh,\" in ver. 4. The literal translation of the two verses is as follows: - And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim (at the fords of Jordan), for, said they, ye are fugitives of Ephraim. (Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh, i.e. between Manasseh and Ephraim, so that in coming from Manasseh, where they had taken refuge, to return to Ephraim they were obliged to pass through Gilead, and the Gileadites had taken the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me pass over, that the men of Gilead said, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay, then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth, etc., i.e. they put him to the test of pronunciation; and if they found by his pronunciation of the word Shibboleth, viz., Sibboleth, that he was an Ephraimite, in spite of his denial, then they took him and slew him (killed him in cold blood) at the passages of Jordan. ) And there fell at that time, etc. The direct narrative goes on here from ver. 4. Omitting the long explanatory parenthesis from the latter part of ver. 4 to the latter part of ver. 6, the narrative runs (ver. 4), And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, for, said they, ye are fugitives of Ephraim; and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. The parenthesis explains why the Ephraimites had to pass through Gilead, and how the Gileadites ascertained in each case whether a man was an Ephraimite or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?

Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Say now Shibboleth, etc. We have thus, as it were, accidentally preserved to us a curious dialectical difference between the Ephraimites and the inhabitants of Gilead. A similar difference exists at the present day between the pronunciation of the inhabitants of different parts of Germany. What the Hanoverians call stein, a stone, the other Germans call shtein. Shibboleth means both an ear of corn and a stream. Forty and two thousand. It is possible that the war between Jephthah and the Ephraimites may have lasted a considerable time, though only the single incident of the slaughter at the fords of Jordan is mentioned, so that the large number of 42,000 men may be less improbable than it seems at first sight. There is, however, always some doubt as to the correctness of numbers (see 1 Samuel 6:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jephthah judged Israel six years.

Then died Jephthah the Gileadite. Better, And Jephthah the Gileadite died. In one of the cities. His exact burial-place was perhaps unknown, and therefore the general phrase in the cities of Judah was used, as in Genesis 13:12. Lot is said to have dwelt in the cities of the plain, and in Nehemiah 6:2 San-ballat asked Nehemiah to meet him in the villages of the plain. Still the phrase is not what you would expect here, and it seems unlikely that Jephthah's burial-place should be unknown. The Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions read, \"in his city Gilead,\" as if Gilead had been the name of Jephthah's paternal city. Another conjecture is that there might have been an Ar of Gilead as well as the well-known Ar of Moab, or there might have been a collection of towns called Arey- Gilead (the towns of Gilead), after the analogy of Havoth-jair (Judges 10:4), but there is no evidence in support of these conjectures.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:8-15NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Ibzan of Bethlehem. It is uncertain whether Bethlehem of Judah is meant, or Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebu-lun, mentioned in Joshua 19:15. Josephus says that Ibzan was of the tribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem, and some have supposed a connection between the names of Boaz and Ibzan. ' But as Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah is generally called Bethlehem of Judah, or Bethlehem-Ephratah, and as Elon and Abdon were judges in North-East Israel, it is perhaps more probable that Bethlehem of Zebulun is meant. Dr. Robinson has identified it with a village - a \"very miserable one\" - called Beit Lahm, six miles west of Nazareth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.

Not Aijalon in the tribe of Dan, mentioned Joshua 10:12; Joshua 19:42, but another city, only spoken of here, whose name is probably preserved in the ruins of Jalun, four hours east of Akka. It is remarkable that the two names Elon and Aijalon are identical in Hebrew as far as the consonants are concerned. It looks as if Aijalon, which is not mentioned among the Zebulonite cities in Joshua 19:10-16, was named from Elon, its possessor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A Pirathonite, i.e. an inhabitant of Pirathon in the tribe of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites (ver. 15), afterwards famous as the birthplace of Benaiah, one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:30). The Pharathon which is mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:50, and by Josephus, following its authority, as fortified by Jonathan the brother of Judas may have been the same, though its collocation between Titans and Tekoah rather suggests a more southern position; and the Ferata found by Robinson between two and three hours from Samaria, south-south-west, on the way to Jerusalem, seems certainly to represent Pirathon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Nephews.

This name points to some incident of which the memory is lost, though, with the usual tenacity of names, the name which once recorded it survives. It may have been some ancient settlement of the Amalekites, who were a very wandering, wide-spread race, which gave the name; or it may have been some great defeat and slaughter which they suffered from the Israelites, whose land they invaded (Judges 6:3, 33), just as the rock Oreb and the wine-press of Zeeb (Judges 7:25) commemorated the victory over those princes.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Did evil again. It by no means follows from this phrase that this chapter is in direct chronological sequence to the preceding The scene is shifted to the tribe of Dan, and to the Philistines on the west, and there is nothing to guide us as to the exact time when the things narrated occurred. But the end of the forty years probably coincided with the judgeship of Samuel; for there was no complete deliverance in the time of Samson, only occasional cheeks to the Philistine domination (see ver. 5). It was not till the days of Samuel that the Philistines were really smitten (see 1 Samuel 7:3-14). We may suppose the date of the ensuing narrative to be somewhere in the first decade of the Philistine oppression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Zorah. Enumerated among the cities in the tribe of Dan in Joshua 19:41, but ascribed to Judah, ibid. 15:33 (there transliterated Zoreah) and in 2 Chronicles 11:10. Probably the boundary passed through the city, as that of Judah and Benjamin did through Jerusalem. In Nehemiah 11:29 it is transliterated Zareah, and also ascribed to Judah. It is almost always coupled with Eshtaol, as in ver. 25 of this chapter. It was situated in the Shephelah, or plain country, and was fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:10). It is supposed to be represented by the modern Surah, at the entrance of the Wady Ghurab. The family of the Danites. It appears from Numbers 26:42, 43 that there was only one family in the tribe of Dan, so that in this case tribe and family were co-extensive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt... bear a son. It is obvious to compare the promise to Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 17:19; Genesis 18:10, 14), to Hannah (1 Samuel 1:17), to Elizabeth (Luke 1:13), and to the blessed Virgin (Luke 1:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The child shall be a Nazarite, etc. So it was said, though not in the same words, concerning Samuel (1 Samuel 1:11) and concerning John the Baptist (Luke 1:15). A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a Nazi-rite) means one separated, and specially dedicated to God. The law of the Nazarites is contained in Numbers 6, where, however, only Nazarites of days, i.e. Nazarites for a definite time, arc spoken cf. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were perpetual Nazarites, Nazarites of for ever, as the Mishna classifies them. Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with \"the hair of the head of his separation,\" as we read in Acts 18:18; Acts 21:23-26. He shall begin, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did. He did not \"deliver Israel\" as the other judges did; but he began to shake the Philistine power, and prepared the way for the deliverance of Israel in the time of his worthier successor Samuel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A man of God, i.e. a prophet, applied to Moses, Samuel, David, Shemaiah, Elijah, Elisha, and other prophets, and to Timothy in the New Testament.

I asked him not, etc. No doubt from awe. Jacob, on the contrary, asked the angel with whom he had wrestled, \"Tell me, I pray thee, thy name\" (Genesis 32:29). See vers. 17, 18. In the Septuagint (Cod. Alex. ) and Vulgate the not is omitted. \"I asked him, but he did not tell me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the woman... ran, etc. Acting in the true spirit of a loving and trustful wife, and showing that she felt that neither angel nor man of God stood before her own husband in the claim to her confidence and obedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let thy words come, etc. The verb is singular in the Hebrew here and in ver. 17. Possibly the true reading is word, as in the Septuagint. If the text is correct, words must be taken collectively, as making one promise. The saying marks Manoah's earnest desire for a son. Some, however, construe it, If thy words come. How shall we order, etc. - literally, What will be the manner of the child, and what will be his doing? i.e. either, What will be his manner (cf. 1 Samuel 8:11, and following verses), and what will be his action or work? or, What will be his proper treatment, and what shall be done to him? The former is the most natural rendering of the words, and though the latter seems at first more suitable to the angel's reply, yet if we take the angel's reply as referring Manoah to what he had said before in vers. 4 and 5, we have a distinct answer to the questions. His manner will be to live as a Nazarite, and his action or work will be to begin to deliver israel (cf. Genesis 16:12, where both the manner and the actione of Ishmael are foretold). In fact, Manoah's question refers directly to vers. 4 and 5, and is a request to have a confirmation of what was then said; just as David asked again and again, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine? (1 Samuel 17:26, 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - She may not eat of anything, etc. Nearly the identical words of Numbers 6:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let us detain thee, etc. He wishes to detain him as a guest till he has had time to cook a kid for him (cf. Genesis 18:7). For thee. The Hebrew is before thee. The phrase is elliptical. The full sentence would be, until we have dressed a kid and set it before thee, as in Genesis 18:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will not eat of thy bread, etc. The angel refuses to eat of his meat, but suggests that if he would offer the kid as a burnt offering, he must offer it to the Lord. The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, \"See thou do it not\" (Revelation 22:9); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (Acts 14:14-18). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - What is thy name? See note to ver. 6. The phrase is very peculiar, literally, Who is thy name? as if he had been going to say, Who art thou? and then changed the form to is thy name. The Hebrews seem to have attached great importance to names, a circumstance due, in part, to every name being significant in the spoken language (see Genesis 4:1, 25; Genesis 5:29; Genesis 16:5, etc.; Genesis 17:19; 25:25, 26; 29 and Genesis 30; 1 Samuel 1:20 Isaiah 9:6; Isaiah 62:4; Jeremiah 23:6; Ephesians 1:21; Philippians 2:9, 10; Revelation 19:16, etc., and. many other passages). Compare also the phrase, the name of the Lord (Isaiah 30:27; Exodus 23:21; Exodus 33:19; Exodus 34:5, 6, 7). Manoah had certainly some suspicious as to the mysterious character of his visitor, and expected the name to reveal his true nature. We may do thee honour. Manoah seems throughout to use ambiguous language, suitable either to a man, if he was speaking to a man, or to a celestial visitant, should he be angel or God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - It is secret. The Hebrew word does not mean secret, but wonderful, as it is rendered in Isaiah 9:6, and elsewhere. His name was one which, as St. Paul expresses it, it is not lawful, or possible, for a man to utter (2 Corinthians 12:4), it was so transcendently wonderful. The feeling of the Hebrews in abstaining from uttering the name יחוה was akin to this. Some take the angel to say that WONDERFUL is his name, but the A.V. is right in prefixing seeing - seeing it is wonderful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Offered it, etc. He had the angel's sanction for doing so in ver. 16. But we must not look for strict compliance with the Levitical law in the lawless days of the Judges, though we find many of its prescribed ordinances in use, as, for instance, the institution of Nazarites, and here the offering of the meat offering with the burnt offering (Leviticus 2:1, etc.). And the angel. These words are rightly inserted, to give the sense of the original, as more fully explained in the following verse. Did wonderously - literally, was wondrous in his doing. The verb here is the same root as the substantive or adjective wonder, or wonderful, in ver. 18. Compare the similar account in Judges 6:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Looked on it. There is no occasion for the italic it, the phrase is identical with that at the close of ver. 19; but the rendering would be better, And when Manoah and his wife saw it, they fell, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - But. It is better rendered and, in close sequence to the preceding words. It follows, Then, i.e. when they saw him go up, they knew that he was an angel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - We shall surely die, etc. Similarly Gideon (Judges 6:22, 28) expressed his alarm because he had \"seen an angel of the Lord face to face,\" but was assured, \"Thou shalt not die.\" And so Isaiah said, \"Woe is me! for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts\" (Isaiah 6:5). So again the Lord said to Moses, \"There shall no man see me and live\" (Exodus 33:20). The name of the well, Beer-lahai-roi, is also thought to mean the well of him that is alive after seeing God (Genesis 16:14). And Jacob called the name of the place where he wrestled with the angel Peniel, \"for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved\" (Genesis 32:30). See too Exodus 20:19. The same belief also prevailed amongst the heathen, that seeing a god without his special permission was visited by death or some grave calamity, as Callimachus, quoted by Grotius, says-NEWLINENEWLINE\"The laws of Saturn thus decree,NEWLINEWho dares immortal gods to seeNEWLINEShall suffer loss, whoe'er he be.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - But his wife said, etc. The woman's faith saw more clearly than the man's fear. With the acceptance of the sacrifice the conscience was cleared from guilt. The ascent of the angel in the flame of the altar was to her the same evidence of an accepted sacrifice as the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus are to us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Called his name Samson. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means \"a strong one,\" but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean like the sun, from shemesh, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as the sun's strength,' possibly with an allusion to Judges 5:31. Others make it equal shim-shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of shamem, to devastate. Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee shemash, to minister, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The Spirit of the Lord, etc. See Judges 3:10, note. To move him - to urge and impel him to strange actions by fits and starts. It is an uncommon expression. In Genesis 41:8 the passive of the verb means to be troubled or agitated, and the substantive is the common word for a time in the phrases time after time, twice, thrice (according to the number specified), other times, etc.; also a footstep; and its derivatives mean an anvil, a bell. The idea is that of sudden, single impulses, such as are described in the following chapters. In the camp of Dan, or, as in Judges 18:12, Mahaneh-Dan, where the reason of the name is explained. For Zorah see ver. 2, note. Eshtaol has not hitherto been identified with any existing place, but it ought to lie east or north of Mahaneh-Dan, since this last was between Zorah and Eshtaol (see note on Judges 18:12). Kustul, a conical hill one hour west of Jerusalem, has been suggested.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Timnath, or, more correctly, Thimnathah, as in Joshua 19:43, a town in the tribe of Dan, the name of which survives in the modern Tibneh, about three miles south-west of Zorah (Judges 13:2, note). It may or may not be identical with Timnath in Genesis 38:12-14, and with Timnah in Joshua 15:10. It appears to have been in the possession of the Philistines at this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Get her, etc. Rather, take her. It is the technical phraseNEWLINENEWLINE(1) for a man taking a wife for himself, as Genesis 4:19; Genesis 6:2; 1 Samuel 25:39, 43, and vers. 3, 8 of this chapter;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) for a man's parents taking a wife for him, as Exodus 34:16; Nehemiah 10:30. The parents of the bridegroom paid the dowry agreed upon (see Genesis 34:12; 1 Samuel 18:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Uncircumcised. Cf. Genesis 34:14. A term of reproach here added to deter Samson from the marriage. It is particularly applied to the Philistines (see Judges 15:18; - 1 Samuel 17:26, 36; 1 Samuel 18:29; 1 Samuel 31:4; 2 Samuel 1:20, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - It was of or from the Lord. It was the method decreed by God's providence for bringing about a rupture with the Philistines. That he sought. Rather, because he sought. The writer explains the purpose of the providence. It is doubtful whether \"he\" refers to Samson or to the Lord. Most commentators refer it to Samson; but it is contrary to the whole tenor of Samson's impetuous course, and to all probability, that he should have asked for the Timnathite damsel merely for the sake of quarreling with the Philistines; whereas the statement that Samson s obstinate determination to take a Philistine wife was the means which God's secret purpose had fixed upon for bringing about the eventual overthrow of the Philistine dominion is in exact accordance with other declarations of Holy Scripture (cf. e.g. Exodus 7:3, 4; Joshua 11:20; 1 Samuel 2:25; 1 Kings 12:15; 2 Chronicles 10:15; 2 Chronicles 22:7; 2 Chronicles 25:20). An occasion. The noun only occurs here; but the verb, in its several conjugations, means, to happen at the right time; to bring a person or thing at the right time (Exodus 21:13, deliver, A.V.); to be brought at the right time (Proverbs 12:21, happen, A.V.); to seek the right time for injuring any one (2 Kings 5:7, seeketh a quarrel, A.V. ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Went down, showing that Timnath was on lower ground than Zorah; it was in fact in the Shephelah. The vineyards of Timnath. The valley of Sorek (Judges 16:4), so famous for its vines (Isaiah 5:2; Jeremiah 2:21), from which it derived its name (Sorek, translated in the above passages the choicest vine, and a noble vine), is thought to have been in the immediate neighbourhood. Probably the whole district under the hills was a succession of vineyards, like the country round Bordeaux. Samson had left the road along which his father and mother were walking, at a pace, perhaps, too slow for his youthful energy, and had plunged into the vineyards. Of a sudden a young lion, - a term designating a lion between the age of a cub and a full-grown lion, - brought there, perhaps, in pursuit of the foxes or jackals, which often had their holes in vineyards (Song of Solomon 2:15), roared against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Spirit of the Lord, etc. - as a spirit of dauntless courage and irresistible strength of body. Came mightily. Hebrew, fell upon him, or passed over upon him, as in ver. 19; 15:14; 1 Samuel 10:6, 10; 1 Samuel 18:10, etc. He rent him, etc. He \"had nothing in his hand,\" no weapon or knife, nor even a stick; but he rent him with as much ease as the kid is rent. The Hebrew has the kid, with the definite article, which is not prefixed unless some particular kid is meant, as in Genesis 38:23. Perhaps the kid means the one about to be served, which the cook rends open either before or after it is cooked. Unless some such operation is alluded to, it is not easy to understand what the rending of the kid means. He told not his father, etc. This is mentioned to. explain ver. 16; but it shows that Samson had wandered some distance from his parents among the vineyards (see note to ver. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Went down, as in ver. 1, where see note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He returned to take her. All the preliminaries being settled between the parents, he returned to Timnath to take his bride by the same road which he and his parents had travelled by before, and, remembering his feat in killing the lion, very naturally turned aside to see what had become of the carcase. And, behold, there was a swarm of bees, etc. This has been objected to as improbable, because bees are very dainty, and would not approach a putrefying body. But as a considerable time had elapsed, it is very possible that either the mere skeleton was left, or that the heat of the sun had dried up the body and reduced it to the state of a mummy without decomposition, as is said to happen often in the desert of Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And... he went on eating, etc. Compare the account of Jonathan finding and eating the wild honey (1 Samuel 14:25, and following verses).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:10-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - So his father went down. It is not clear what is meant by this mention of his father alone; but it was probably some part of the wedding etiquette that the father should go to the bride first alone; perhaps, as Kimehi says, to give her notice of the bridegroom's approach, that she might get ready. Among the preparations may have been the selection of the thirty young men to be \"the children of the bride-chamber\" (Matthew 9:15). As these were all Philistines, the inference is that they were selected by the bride, just as with us the bride has the privilege of choosing the minister who is to officiate at the marriage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When they saw him, i.e. when the father and mother and friends of the bride saw him approaching, they went to meet him with the thirty companions who had been selected. We still see a strong resemblance to the wedding arrangements referred to in Matthew 9:15, and Matthew 25:1-12; only in this case they were young men instead of young women who went out to meet the bridegroom. We may observe, by the way, that the scale of the wedding feast, as regards numbers and duration, indicates that Samson s family was one of wealth and position.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Riddle. The Hebrew word is the same as that which is rendered hard questions in 1 Kings 10:1, and dark questions, Numbers 12:8, and occurs also in Ezekiel 17:2, where the phrase is the same as here and in ver. 16, as if we should say in English, I will riddle you a riddle. In English, however, to riddle, as a verb active, means to solve a riddle, not, as in Hebrew, to propound one. The derivation of the Hebrew word and of the English is the same as regards the sense - something intricate and twisted. Thirty sheets, or rather, as in the margin, shirts, a linen garment worn next the skin. In Isaiah 3:23 spoken of the women's garment, \"the fine linen,\" A.V., as also Proverbs 31:24. The word (sadin, Sanscrit sindu) means Indian linen. Change of garments - the outward garment of the Orientalist, which was part of the wealth of the rich and great, and was, and is to the present day, one of the most frequent presents on all state occasions (see Genesis 45:22; 2 Kings 5:5, 22; Isaiah 3:6, 7; Matthew 6:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - On the seventh day. There is some apparent difficulty in understanding how to reconcile this statement with what was said in ver. 14, that they could not in three days expound the riddle; and also with what is said in vers. 16 and 17, that Samson's wife wept before him the seven days of the feast. And several different readings have arisen from this difficulty: viz., in this verse, the reading of the fourth day for the seventh, and the omission of the words, And it came to pass on the seventh day; and, in the latter part of ver. 14, seven days for three days. But all difficulty will disappear if we bear in mind the peculiarity of Hebrew narrative noticed in note to section vers. 1-6 of ch. 2, when we come to consider ver. 16. Entice thy husband. Cf. Judges 16:5. That he may declare unto us. If the text is sound, they must mean to say, declare it unto you, that you may declare it unto us, i.e. declare it unto us through you. But it is simpler either to read with the Septuagint, that he may declare unto you, etc., or to read, and declare unto us, in the imperative mood. Burn with fire. See ch. 12:1, and Judges 15:6. Have ye called us, etc., i.e. Did you invite us to this feast in order to impoverish us, to plunder us of our property? We shall conclude that you did so if you do not disclose to us the riddle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And Samson's wife, etc. This statement does not follow ver. 15, but is a parallel narrative to that beginning in ver. 14, \"And they could not in three days,\" etc., down to the end of ver. 15, bringing the story down to the same point of time, viz., the seventh day. One stream of the narrative tells us what the young men did when Samson had propounded his riddle; the other tells us what Samson's wife did. From the very first, no doubt, she had wished to be in the secret, not perhaps from treacherous motives, but from curiosity, and the natural desire to be in her husband's confidence, and she pressed her request with cajolery and petulance. The young men at the same time had tried to find out the riddle by fair means. But on the seventh day they threatened to burn her and her father unless she found out the riddle for them, and under the terror of this threat she extracted the secret from Samson and divulged it to the Philistine young men. The only difficulty is to explain why a gap of four days occurs in the account between vers. 14 and 15. The most likely thing is, that after three days' vain attempt to find out the riddle, they began to tamper with Samson's wife, offering her money, as the Philistine lords did to Delilah (Judges 16:5), though the narrative does not mention it; but that on the seventh day, becoming desperate, and thinking that the woman was not doing her best, they resorted to the dreadful threat of burning her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - She lay sore upon him. In Judges 16:16 the same word is rendered pressed him. It came to pass on the seventh day. This is the confluence of the two streams of narrative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The men of the city - the same as were spoken of in ver. 11 as Samson's companions. Before the sun went down - just in time, therefore, to save the wager, as defined in ver. 12. This is the uncommon word for the sun used also in Judges 8:13, where see note. What is sweeter, etc. They put their answer in a form to make it seem as if they had guessed the riddle; but Samson instantly perceived his wife's treachery, and showed that he did so by quoting the proverb of plowing with another person s heifer. They had not used their own wit to find out the riddle, but had learnt the secret at Samson's cost, through his wife. He insinuates that had they acted fairly he would have won the wager.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The Spirit of the Lord, etc. - as in ver. 6 and Judges 13:25, where see notes. The verb here, came upon him, is the same as in ver. 6. Thirty men - the number of the companions to whom he felt bound to pay the thirty changes of garment. Ashkelon (Judges 1:18) - one of the five Philistine cities, but the least often mentioned, owing, it is thought, to its remote situation \"on the extreme edge of the shore of the Mediterranean, far down in the south.\" It still preserves its ancient name, and was famous in the time of the Crusaders. \"Within the walls and towers now standing Richard (Coeur de Lion) held his court.\" The onion called eschalot, or shallot, is named from Eshkalon, or Ashkalon. Their spoil - that which was stripped from them. His anger was kindled - against the Philistines in general, and his wife in particular, so that he went back to his father s house without her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - His companion - no doubt his \"best man,\" the \"friend of the bridegroom.\" The parents of the Thimnathite, having no doubt obtained Samson's dower, and supposing him to have finally broken with his treacherous wife, proceeded to give her in marriage to the Philistine young man who had been Samson's friend - perhaps the man to whom she had told the riddle. The sad end of this unhappy alliance fully justified the opposition of Samson's parents to it in ver. 3.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Within a while - the same expression as that in Judges 14:8, rendered \"after a time,\" and in Judges 11:4, rendered \"in process of time.\" In the time of wheat harvest - about the month of May. The harvest, as appears from ver. 5, had begun, some corn being already cut, and in shocks; the rest still standing, and, being ready to be cut, of course extremely dry and inflammable. With a kid, as a present, intended no doubt to make peace (Genesis 38:17). His anger (Judges 14:19) had now passed away, and his love for his wife had returned. He was little prepared to find her married again to his friend.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Is not her younger sister, etc. Samson's father-in-law might well have thought that Samson had forsaken his wife, and would never forgive her treachery. Possibly too he was a covetous man, and glad to get a second dower. Anyhow, his answer was conciliatory; but Samson was not in a mood to accept excuses, or be softened by conciliation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I shall be more blameless than the Philistines. The phrase rather means, I shall be blameless (or guiltless) before the Philistines, i.e. in relation to the Philistines, - they will have nothing to lay to my charge; my revenge will be a just one, - as in Numbers 32:22: Then shall ye be guiltless before the Lord, and be. fore Israel. He means that so grievous an injury as he had received in having his wife taken from him and given to a Philistine will justify any requitals on his part.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Foxes. The word here rendered fox (shu'al, in Persian shagal, which is etymologically the same word as jackal) includes the jackal, which is as common in Palestine as the fox. Here, and in Psalm 63:10, the gregarious jackals, the canis aureus, are undoubtedly meant. Caught. The Hebrew word means especially caught in nets or snares. See Amos 3:5 (have taken nothing at all); Psalm 35:8 (let his net catch himself); Jeremiah 18:22; Isaiah 8:14 (taken), etc. And it is in this sense that the A.V. uses the word caught. A clever sportsman, as no doubt Samson was, would have no difficulty whatever in netting or snaring 300 jackals, which always move in packs, and would be attracted by the vineyards of Thimnathah, for which their partiality is well known (see Judges 14:5, note). The writer of the additional article Fox in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' states that he had tried the experiment of throwing grapes to the foxes, jackals, and wolves in the Zoological Gardens. The wolves would not touch them, the others ate them with avidity. Took firebrands, etc. Many cavils have been directed against the truth of this account, but without the slightest reason. The terrified animals, with the burning torches and the blazing straw behind them, would necessarily run forwards. Samson would, of course, start the couples at numerous different points, and no doubt have a number of Hebrews to assist him. To the present day the corn-fields in that part of the Shephelah extend continuously for twenty or thirty miles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The shocks and the standing corn. See ver. 1, note. With the vineyards and olives. The Hebrew text has the orchards of olive trees - the word cherem, usually translated vineyard, meaning also any orchard; but the Septuagint in both codices supplies and, as does the A. Y., which gives the more probable sense, vineyards and olives. It is unlikely that the vineyards should not be mentioned, in a district abounding in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the Philistines... burnt her and her father with fire. See Judges 14:15. It appears from Genesis 38:24; Leviticus 20:14; Leviticus 21:9; Joshua 7:15, 25, that burning with fire was a judicial punishment among the Hebrews. Possibly the Philistines, in their fear of Samson, and perhaps also from a rude sense of justice, inflicted this punishment upon the Thimnathite and her father as the real authors of the destruction of their corn-fields, by giving Samson so unheard-of provocation. Note the fact of the identical fate overtaking Samson's wife which she had sought to escape by base treachery (cf. John 11:48 with what actually happened).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And Samson said, etc. There are two ways of understanding Samson's speech: one, with the A.V., as meaning to say that though the Philistines had taken his part, and repudiated all fellowship in the shameful deed of the Thimnathite and her father, yet he would have his full revenge upon them; the other, translating the particle in its more common sense of if, makes him say, \"If this is the way you treat me, be sure I will not cease till I have had my full revenge.\" This is perhaps on the whole the most probable meaning. It still leaves it uncertain whether the Philistines meant to do Samson justice, or to do him an additional injury, by putting his wife and her father to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He smote them hip and thigh, etc. A proverbial expression, the origin of which is uncertain; it means, he smote them with a great and complete slaughter. It is reasonable to suppose that he had gathered a few Hebrews round him to help him. He went down, etc. This shows that Etam must have been situated lower than Tinmath, and seems to preclude its identification with Urtas, in the hill country of Judah, between Bethlehem and Tekoah, which apparently represents the Etam of 2 Chronicles 11:6. But there is another Etam in the tribe of Simeon (1 Chronicles 4:32), which may possibly be the Etam of our text. In the top of the rock. Rather, the cleft or fissure of the rock - some narrow and inaccessible ravine. The site has not been identified.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 15:9-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Went up, i.e. from their own country in the Shephelah to the hill country of Judah. As Samson had avenged his wrongs on the whole Philistine people, so they now came up to Judah to take vengeance for Samson's injuries. In Lehi, or, rather, hal-Lehi, the Lehi, the place afterwards so called, as related in vers. 17 and 20 (see Judges 7:25, note). Lehi has been identified by some with Tell-el-Lekhiyeh, four miles above Beer-sheba; and by others with Beit-Likiyeh, in the Wady Suleiman, two miles below the upper Beth-heron, and so within easy distance of Timnath and other places mentioned in the history of Samson. But no certainty can at present be arrived at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Men of Judah. It is rather three thousand men went down from Judah, showing that the rock Etam was below. The top. It should be the cleft, as in ver. 8. Knowest thou not, etc. The language of these cowardly men shows how completely the Philistine yoke was fastened upon the necks of Judah. The history gives no account of the Philistine conquest; except the brief allusion in Judges 10:6, 7; but Samson's story brings to light the existence of it. The abject state to which they were reduced is shown By their complaint of Samson, What is this that thou hast done unto us?\" instead of hailing him as a deliverer. As they did unto me, etc. It is instructive to read Samson's defence of himself in the very words used by the Philistines in ver. 10. \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\" There is no end to rendering \"evil for evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - We are come down to bind thee. There is something very base in this deliberate agreement with their Philistine masters to deliver up Samson bound into their hands. But it is not very unlike the spirit in which the Hebrews looked upon Moses when he first began to work to rescue them from their Egyptian bondage (Exodus 2:14; Acts 7:25-28). Samson's forbearance towards his own countrymen is commendable. Brought him up - from the deep ravine or cleft in which he was hid. His place of concealment was probably unknown to the Philistines, or may be they had quite a superstitious fear of Samson from their experience of his prowess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When he came, i.e. as soon as he was come to Lehi, where the Philistine camp was (ver. 9). Shouted against him. Rather, shouted as they ran out to meet him. It expresses concisely the double action of their all going out to meet him, and shouting with joy when they saw him bound and, as they thought, in their power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A most vivid and stirring description! The Spirit of the Lord (Judges 14:19), with that suddenness which marks his extraordinary movements (1 Kings 18:12; 2 Kings 2:16; Acts 2:2; Acts 8:39, etc.), came upon Samson, and mightily strengthened him in his outer man. The strong new cords snapped asunder in an instant, and before the Philistines could recover from their terror at seeing their great enemy free, he had snatched up the heavy jawbone of an ass recently dead, and with it smote the flying Philistines till a thousand of them had fallen under his blows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And Samson said, etc. The exploit gave birth to one of Sam son's punning, enigmatical, sayings: \"With the jawbone of the ass, one heap, two heads of slain.\" Hamor, an ass, means also an heap. If one were to imitate the passage in English, supposing that the jaw of a sheep had been the implement, it might run something like this - By the jaw of a sheep they fell heap upon heap. A Latin imitation is, Maxilla cervi, acervum acervos (Bochart). He adds, as if in explanation, With the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. So the women sang, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands (1 Samuel 18:7), And a Latin song is quoted, in which Aurelian is made to say after the Sarmatic war - \"Mille Sarmatas, mille Frances, Semel et semel occidimus, Mille Persas quaerimus\" (Bp. Patrick on Judges 15.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Made an end of speaking, i.e. of reciting the song about the heaps of slain. It is singular that the word rendered speaking might also be rendered destroying, as in 2 Chronicles 22:10. Called that place Ramath-lechi, i.e. the height of Lechi, or of the jawbone, or, rather, the throwing away of the jawbone. He commemorated the exact spot where the slaughter ceased and the weapon Was thrown away by giving it the name of Ramath-Lechi, or, as it was called for shortness, Lechi (or hal-Lechi).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He was sore athirst. The incredible exertions which he had made in pursuing and slaying the Philistines put him in danger of his life from thirst. He thought he should die, and be found and abused by his uncircumcised foes. His only resource was prayer to God, who had helped him hitherto, We may note by the way that the more God gives, the more he encourages us to ask.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But (or, and) God clave, etc. Cf. Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:8, 11. The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi (hal-Lehi, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name En-hakkorch, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) hollow place (ham-maktesh) means a mortar; also the cavity in the jaw from which the molar teeth grow. The hollow ground from which the spring rose, with which Samson quenched his thirst, from its shape and from the connection with hal-Lechi (the jawbone) was called hammaktech. In Zephaniah 1:11 it is also a proper name, apparently of some spot near Jerusalem. The name thereof, i.e. of the fountain, with which thereof, which is in the feminine gender, agrees. Which is in Lehi unto this day. This punctuation does not agree with the Hebrew accents, which put a strong stop after Lehi. The Hebrew accents rather convey the sense that the name En-kakkoreh continued to be the name of the well unto the day of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And he judged Israel, etc. See ch. 16:81. It looks as if it had been the intention to close the history of Samson with these Words, but that ch. 16. was subsequently added, possibly from other sources. Compare the close of chs. 20. and 21. of the Gospel of St. John. A possible explanation, however, of this verse being placed here is that it results from the statement in ver. 19, that Samson's spirit came again, and he revived, or came to life again, after being on the very point of death; and, adds the writer, he judged Israel after this for twenty years.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Then. It should be and. There is nothing to show when the incident occurred. It may have been many years after his victory at hal-Lechi, towards the latter part of his twenty years' judgeship. Gaza, now Ghuzzeh, one of the five chief cities of the Philistines, once a strong place, but now a large open town. It was the last town in South-West Palestine on the road from Jerusalem to Egypt (Acts 8:26, 27). It played an important part in history in all ages - in the times, of the Pharaohs, the Seleucidae, the Maccabees, the Romans, the Khalifs, and the Crusaders. It was within the limits of the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:47). It is first mentioned in Genesis 10:19, as the south-west border of the Canaanites. Its real transliteration from the Hebrew is Azzah, as it is actually expressed in the A.V. of Deuteronomy 2:23, and 1 Kings 4:24. Gaza is the Greek form.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And it was told. These words have no doubt accidentally fallen out of the Hebrew text, but they are necessary to the sense, and are expressed in all the ancient versions. We have no clue as to the motive of Samson's visit to Gaza, whether he was meditating its conquest, or an assault upon its inhabitants, or whether he came merely in the wild spirit of adventure, or upon civil business. We only know that he came there, that, with his usual weakness, he fell into the snare of female blandishments, that the Philistines thought to have caught him and killed him, but that he escaped by his supernatural strength. Gaza is about thirteen hours' march from Thimnathah. They compassed him in. The Hebrew does not express this idea, nor is it what the Gazites did. It should be rendered, They went about and lay in wait for him. Instead of attacking him directly, they took a round-about course, and set an ambush for him in the city gates, probably in the guard-room by the side of the gate, intending when he came forth unsuspectingly in the morning, at the hour of opening the gates, to rush upon him and kill him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Samson arose at midnight. Possibly the woman had learnt the plot, and gave Samson warning, after the manner of Rahab; or she may have been his betrayer, and reckoned upon retaining him till the morning; anyhow he arose at midnight, when the liers in wait were sleeping securely, and tearing up the two gate-pests, with the gates and the cross-bar attached to them, walked off with them \"as far as the top of the hill that is before Hebron.\" Took the doors, etc. Rather, laid hold of. For went away with them, translate plucked them up. It is the technical word for plucking up the tent pins. Bar and all, or, with the bar. The bar was probably a strong iron or wooden crossbar, which was attached to the posts by a lock, and could only be removed by one that had the key. Samson tore up the posts with the barred gates attached to them, and, putting the whole mass upon his back walked off with it. The hill that is before Hebron. Hebron \"was about nine geographical, or between ten and eleven English, miles from Gaza, situated in a deep, narrow valley, with high hills on either side.\" It is approached from Gaza over a high ridge, from the top of which Hebron becomes visible, lying in the valley below at fifty minutes' distance. This spot would suit very well the description, \"the hill that is before Hebron.\" Some, however, think that the hill called el Montar, about three-quarters of an hour from Gaza, on the road to Hebron, is here meant, and that the plain before Hebron merely means towards, as in Genesis 18:16; Deuteronomy 32:49.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Sorek. See Judges 14:5, note. The name has not yet been discovered as applied to any existing spot; but Eusebius in the 'Onomasticon' speaks of a village Caphar-sorek as still existing near Zorah. The term valley (nachal) describes a wady, i.e. a narrow valley with a stream.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Lords. See Judges 3:3, note,' His great strength lieth - literally, wherein (or by what means) his strength is great. They guessed that it was through some charm or secret amulet that his Herculean might was nourished. Eleven hundred pieces, or shekels, of silver. The whole sum promised by the five lords would be no less than 5500 shekels, equal to about £620 of our money. The curious notation, eleven hundred pieces, occurs again Judges 17:2. The reason of it is unknown.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - As another man - literally, as one of men, i.e. of mankind, not different from other men. As regards the word rendered withs, it is not certain whether strings of cat-gut are not meant In Psalm 11:2 the same word is used of a bow-string. The word rendered green means fresh or new, and might be equally applied to catgut strings or withs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - There were men lying in wait - literally, and the liers in wait were abiding for her in the chamber. She had hid some three or four men in the chamber unknown to Samson, that they might be ready to fall upon him should his strength really have departed from him. The word for liers in wait is in the singular number, but is to be taken collectively, as in Judges 20:33, 36-38. In Judges 20:37 it is joined to a plural verb. It is to be presumed that through some concerted signal the liers in wait did not discover themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Wherewith, or rather, as in ver. 8, by what means.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ropes - literally, twisted things; hence cords or ropes, as Psalm 2:3; Isaiah 5:18. Occupied - an old obsolete phrase, for which we should now say used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDelilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Took new ropes. She had them by her, apparently, or could easily procure them, as it is not said that the lords brought them to her. And there were liers. Rather, as before, and the liers in wait were abiding, etc. Each time she had persuaded the lords that Samson had divulged his secret, and that she would deliver him into the hands of the men whom they sent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The seven locks, by which we learn that his mass of hair as a Nazarite was arranged in seven locks or plaits. His resistance was becoming weaker, and he now approached the dangerous ground of his unshorn hair. With the web. This must mean the warp, which was already fastened in the loom, and across which Samson s locks were to be woven as the woof.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And she fastened it with the pin. The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, So she struck with the shuttle, i.e. she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. To strike with the peg or shuttle may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, \"Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle.\" With the pin of the beam, and with the web. The Hebrew word 'ereg cannot mean the beam, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb to weave in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is the woof. The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, i.e. Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the warp. He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his plucking up the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it. However, as we do not know the technical term of the art of the weaving among the Hebrews and Philistines, nor the precise construction of their looms, some obscurity necessarily attaches to this description.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thy great strength lieth - as before, ver. 6, thy strength is great.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So that.

This begins a new sentence. Read, And he told her. Any other man. Rather, like all men. Man, though singular in the Hebrew, is collective as in ver. 7, and as the lier in wait in vers. 9 and 12, and is properly rendered men in English.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.

So the Keri; but the written text has her instead of me, which is favoured by the tense of the verb came up. If her is the true reading, these words would be the addition of the messenger, explaining why she told them to come up once more, or of the narrator, for the same purpose. Brought money. It should be the money, the stipulated bribe (ver. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - She called for a man. It is she called to the man - the man whom she had secreted in the chamber before she put Samson to sleep, that he might cut off the locks. She caused him to shave. In the Hebrew it is she shaved, but it probably means that she did so by his instrumentality. She began to afflict, or humble, him. His strength began to wane immediately his locks began to be shorn, and it was all gone by the time his hair was all cut off.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And shake myself, i.e. shake off the Philistines who encompass me; but when he said so he knew not that the Lord had departed from him, and that he was indeed become weak like other men (see a fine sermon of Robert Hall's from this text).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Put out his eyes. One of the cruel punishments of those times (see Numbers 16:14; 2 Kings 25:7), and still, or till quite lately, practised by Oriental despots to make their rivals incapable of reigning. So King John, in Shakespeare, ordered Arthur s eyes to be put out with a hot iron (King John, Act IV. scene 1.). Herodotus (Melp. 4:2) says that the Scythians used to put out the eyes of all their slaves. He did grind - the most degrading form of labour, the punishment of slaves among the Greeks and Romans (see too Isaiah 47:2).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:23-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Gathered them, i.e. themselves. To rejoice. The Hebrew is for a festivity, or merry-making, or feast. There was to be a great feast upon the sacrifices offered to Dagon their God. Dagon (from dag, a fish in Hebrew), the national male god of the Philistines, as Atergatis, or Derceto, was their goddess. Both the male and female divinities seem to have had the head and breast and hands human, and the rest of the body fish-shaped (see 1 Samuel 5:5). The fish was a natural emblem of fertility and productiveness, especially to a maritime people. The fish-shaped idol is found upon old Phoenician coins, and also on the monuments of Khorsabad, and on some Assyrian gems in the British Museum. One of the chief temples of Dagon was at Gaza. Several towns bore the name of Dagon, as Beth-dagon in Judah (Joshua 15:41) and in Asher (Joshua 19:27), Caphar-dagon near Diospolis, etc., showing that the worship of Dagon was widespread.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And when the people, etc. The .people, as distinguished from the lords in the preceding verse, to show how universally the capture of Samson was ascribed to Dagon. Rulers and people alike praised Dagon. Saw him. Not on the occasion of his being brought into the temple as mentioned in ver. 25, but after his capture, and whenever they saw him grinding or elsewhere. It was this universal ascription of praise to Dagon that led to the celebration of this great feast. This praise of Dagon is also dwelt upon to show that God, in what happened, vindicated the glory of his own great name, which was blasphemed by the servants of Dagon when they thus made him superior to Jehovah. So Milton makes Samson say, \"All the contest is now 'Twixt God and Dagon .... He, be sure, will not connive or linger, thus provoked, but will arise, and his great name assert.\" Generally, the 'Samson Agonistes' is an excellent commentary on the history of Samson.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When their hearts were merry. They would not have acted so imprudently as to bring Samson out of his prison had not their judgment been clouded with drink. That he may make us sport. And he made them sport. The two verbs are not the same in Hebrew, but they have much the same meaning. It is not certain whether the idea conveyed is that of the A.V., that Samson was brought there to be as it were baited by the populace, jeered and jested at, reviled and reproached, perhaps struck or pelted; or whether the words do not simply mean to dance with music, which is certainly the meaning of the latter verb (he made sport before them, A.V. and margin) in 1 Samuel 18:7 (played, A.V.; see ver. 6); 2 Samuel 6:5, 21; 1 Chronicles 13:8; 1 Chronicles 15:29. They set him between the pillars, i.e. when he had done dancing; because he must have been dancing outside the house for the people on the roof to see him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Suffer me, or it may be rendered, Let me rest. He pretended to be tired, and asked to be allowed to rest a few minutes and lean against the pillars. That I may feel, or, literally, and make me feel. He adds his motive for making the request - that I may lean upon them - to rest himself after the severe exercise of dancing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Now the house was full, etc. We do not know what was the construction of Philistine temples or houses of amusement; but from the description here given it seems that the interior was ranged like an amphi- theatre, with seats for the lords and principal people, and with an open front, so as to command a view of the stage just outside, and that front supported by pillars on which the beams of the roof, both the transverse beam and the longitudinal ones running into it, rested. The roof itself was fiat, and had the weight of 3000 people upon it, throwing a great strain upon the beams which rested upon the pillars. The sudden removal of the pillars would bring the roof down at that end, crowded as it was with the people, and would inevitably drag the whole mass in the same direction one over another, while the swaying of the people would bring the whole roof down upon the heads of those beneath, who would be crushed by the heavy timbers and stones and bodies of men falling upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And Samson called unto the Lord. This is the first mention we have of Samson praying since the memorable occasion when he gave the fountain the name of En-hakkoreh (Judges 15:19, note). Perhaps we may see in this an evidence that his affliction and shame had not been without their effect, in bringing him back to God humbled and penitent. The language is very earnest. \"O Lord, Jehovah, remember me strengthen me only this once, O God!\" The threefold name by which he addresses the Almighty implies great tension of spirit. That I may be at once avenged. Meaning at one stroke - he would take one vengeance so terrible that it would be sufficient for his two eyes, which makes very good sense if the Hebrew will bear it. The literal translation would be, that I may be avenged with a vengeance of one stroke. Others take it, that I may be avenged with a vengeance for one of my two eyes, which it is not easy to understand the meaning of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The two middle pillars. There may have been, say, four pillars in the front; the two middle ones standing near together, and the other two nearer the sides.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Let me die, or, my life shall perish with the Philistines. He knew it was certain death to himself, but he did not shrink from it. His last act should be to destroy the oppressors of his country. So the dead which he slew, etc. The words sound like the snatch of some song or proverb in which Samson's death was described.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - His brethren, etc. Some infer from this that Samson's mother bare other children after the birth of Samson. But the Hebrew use of the word brethren is so wide, applied to cousins, or members of the same house of fathers, or of the same tribe, that it is by no means a certain inference. Here his brethren might mean the Danites generally, and all the house of his father those who were more nearly related, as belonging to the house of his father. His father was probably dead, and indeed the mention of his father's burying-place, or rather sepulchre, makes it certain that he was, so that Milton was in error in making him alive. Zorah and Eshtaol. See above, Judges 13:2, 25, note. And he judged Israel. See Judges 15:20. The parallel between Samson and Hercules is in many respects very remarkable, and has been drawn out by Serdrius and others. The supernatural strength of each, the slavery to women (\"Quem non mille for, quem non Sthenellius hostis, Non potuit Mayors vincere, vicit amor.\" Ovid), the tearing asunder of the lion, the violent death of each, partly voluntary and partly forced, are all points of strong general resemblance. But one of the most remarkable is the connection of Hercules with two pillars. The \"pillars of Hercules\" on each side the straits of Gibraltar, Mount Abila and Mount Calpe, were said to have been rent asunder by the strength of Hercules' arms. And Herodotus relates that in the temple of Hercules at Tyre were two remarkable pillars, one of refined gold, the other of smaragdus, some green stone like an emerald (2:44). But the account given of a visit of Hercules to Egypt is still more remarkable, as compared with the history of the binding of Samson and the slaughter of the Philistines, as related in ch. 15. The following are the words of Herodotus: - \"The Greeks say that when Hercules went down to Egypt, the Egyptians surrounded him, and led him in a procession to sacrifice him to Jupiter; that he kept quite still for a time, but that when they were commencing the sacrifice at the altar\" (the first act of which was cutting off the hair) \"he turned in self-defence, and by his prowess slew them all.\" On which Herodo. tus remarks, \"How was it possible for him, being but one, and being only a man, to slay many myriads?\" The prevalence of the worship of Hercules among the Phoenicians, as, e.g., at Tyre and Thasos, a Phoenician colony, and the close connection of Egypt with Gaza, where the prowess of Samson was so well known, are points not to be omitted in considering the probability of some of the legends of Hercules being drawn from the history of Samson. So also is the title of the Phoenician Hercules, the saviour or deliverer, as compared with Judges 2:16, 18; Judges 13:5.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - We here light upon quite a different kind of history from that which has preceded. We no longer have to do with judges and their mighty deeds in delivering Israel from his oppressors, but with two detached histories, which fill up the rest of the book, relating to the internal affairs of Israel. There is no note of time, except that they happened before the time of Saul the king (Judges 17:6; Judges 18:1), and. that Phinehas the son of Eleazar was alive at the time of the occurrence of the second (Judges 20:28). Both, no doubt, are long prior to Samson. The only apparent connection of the history of Micah with that of Samson is that both relate to the tribe of Dan, and it may be presumed were contained in the annals of that tribe. Compare the opening of the Books of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:1). Mount Ephraim; i.e. the hill country of Ephraim, as in Judges 3:27; Judges 7:24, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The eleven hundred. See Judges 16:5, note. Thou cursedst. The Cethib and the Alexandrian Codex of the Septuagint read, Thou cursedst, i.e.. adjuredst me, which is a better reading. There is a direct and verbal reference to the law contained in Leviticus 5:1. The word thou cursedst here and the voice of swearing in Leviticus are the same root. It was in consequence of this adjuration that Micah confessed his guilt. Compare Matthew 26:63, when our Lord, on the adjuration of the high priest, broke his silence and confessed that he was Christ, the Son of God. In Achan's confession (Joshua 7:19, 20) there is no distinct reference to Leviticus 5:1, though this may have been the ground of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I had wholly dedicated. It is not clear whether the words are to be rendered as in the A.V., had dedicated, expressing the dedication of them before they were stolen, or whether they merely express her present purpose so to dedicate them. But the A.V. makes very good sense. Her former purpose had been that the money should be given for her son's benefit to make his house an house of gods. Now that he had confessed, she resumed her purpose. Now therefore I restore it unto thee - that is, in the shape of the graven and molten images, as it follows in the next verse. The narrative gives a curious example of the semi-idolatry of the times. A graven image and a molten image. There is a good deal of difficulty in assigning the exact meaning of the two words here used, and their relation to one another in the worship to which they belong. The molten image (massechah), however, seems to be pretty certainly the metal, here the silver, image of a calf, the form which the corrupt worship of Jehovah took from the time when Aaron made the molten calf (Exodus 32:4, called there 'egel massechah, a molten calf) to the time when Jeroboam set up the golden calves at Dan and Bethel (1 Kings 12:28, 29). And that massechah means something molten is certain both from its etymology (nasach, to pour) and from what Aaron said in Exodus 32:24: \"I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\" Here too Micah's mother gives the silver to the founder, i.e. to the fuser of metals. The pesel, or graven image, on the other hand, is something hewn or graven, whether in wood or stone, and sometimes overlaid with gold and silver (Deuteronomy 7:25). One might have thought, from the language of ver. 4, and from the mention of the pesel alone in Judges 18:30, 31, that only one image is here intended, which was graven with the chisel after it was cast, as Aaron's calf seems to have been. But in Judges 18:17, 18 they are mentioned separately, with the ephod and teraphim named between them, so that they must be distinct. From the above passages the pesel or graven image would seem to have been the most important object, and the difficulty is to assign the true relation of the massechah or molten image to it. Hengstenberg thinks the massechah was a pedestal on which the pesel stood, and that the ephod was the robe with which the pesel was clothed, and that the teraphim were certain tokens or emblems attached to the ephod which gave oracular answers. But this is not much more than guess-work. Berthean considers the ephod, here as elsewhere, to be the priest's garment, put on when performing the most solemn services, and specially when seeking an answer from God. And he thinks that the massechah formed a part of the ornament of the ephod, because in Judges 18:18 the Hebrew has \"the pesel of the ephod.\" The teraphin he thinks are idols, a kind of Dii minores associated with the worship of Jehovah in this impure worship. But there does not seem to be any means at present of arriving at any certainty. The massechah might be a rich gold or silver overlaying of the wooden image, possibly movable, or it might be the separate image of a calf supposed to belong, as it were, to the pesel, and to symbolise the attributes of the Godhead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Yet he restored. Rather, so he restored, repeating what was said in ver. 3, and adding the consequence, that his mother took two hundred shekels and gave them to the founder. It is a great puzzle to explain why two hundred shekels only are here spoken of, and what became of the other nine hundred. Bertheau thinks the two hundred were different from the eleven hundred, and were the fifth part of the whole value stolen, which the thief, according to Leviticus 6:5, was bound to give in addition to the principal. He therefore translates ver. 4 thus: \"So he restored the money to his mother (and his mother took two hundred shekels), and she gave it (the money 1100 shekels) to the founder,\" etc. Others understand that two hundred only were actually made into the graven and molten image, and the other nine hundred were devoted to other expenses of the worship. In the house of Micah. This explains, Now I will restore it unto thee, and, for my son to make, etc., in ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the man Micah, etc. It is impossible to say for certain whether the state of things here described in respect of Micah preceded the events narrated in the preceding verses, or was consequent upon them. If it preceded, then we have the reason of his mother's vow: she wished to make her son's \"house of God\" complete by the addition of a graven and molten image. If it was consequent upon his mother's vow, then we have in the opening verses of this chapter a history of the circumstances of the foundation of Micah's \"house of God,\" which was to play an important part in the colony of Danites, whose proceedings arc related in the following chapter, and for the sake of which this domestic history of Micah is introduced. House of gods. Rather, of God (Elohim); for the worship was of Jehovah, only with a corrupt and semi-idolatrous ceremonial. An ephod. See Judges 8:26, 27, note. Teraphim. See Genesis 31:19 (images, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); 1 Samuel 15:23 (idolatry, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); 19:13 (an image, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); Hosea 3:4,to etc. They seem to have been a kind of Penates, or household gods, and were used for divination (Ezekiel 21:21; Zechariah 10:2). Became his priest. One function of the priest, and for which it is likely he was much resorted to, was to inquire of God by the ephod (Judges 18:5, 6). What his other duties might be does not appear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - There was no king. This must have been written in the days of the kings of Israel and Judah, and perhaps with reference to the efforts of such kings as Ass (1 Kings 15:13) and Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22:43) to put down idolatry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Of the family of Judah. These words are difficult to explain. If the man was a Levite he could not be of the family or tribe of Judah. Some explain the words to be merely a more accurate definition of Bethlehem-judah, as if he would say, I mean Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah. Others explain them to mean that he was one of a family of Levites who had settled in Bethlehem, and so came to be reckoned in civil matters as belonging to Judah. Others, that he was of the family of Judah on his mother s side, which might be the cause of his settling at Bethlehem. But many commentators think them spurious, as they are not found in the Septuagint (Cod. Vat.), nor in the Peschito, nor in No. 440 of De Rossi's MSS. The Septuagint has Bethlehem of the family of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - From Bethlehem-judah.

So the Levite went in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - A father. This is not a common application of the word father in the Old Testament. The prominent idea seems to be one of honour, combined with authority to teach and advise. It is applied to prophets (2 Kings 2:12; 2 Kings 6:21; 2 Kings 13:14), and to Joseph (Genesis 45:8). The idea is implied in the converse phrase of son, applied to those to whom the prophets stood in 'the relation of spiritual fathers (see 2 Kings 8:9; Proverbs 4:10, 20, and frequently elsewhere). The abuse of the feeling which dictates the term as applied to human teachers is reproved by our Lord (Matthew 23:9). It has been freely used in the Christian Church, as in the titles papa or pope applied to bishops, abbot and abbas, father in God, fathers of the Church, etc. Here there is perhaps a special reference to the function of Micah's priest to ask counsel of God, and then give that counsel to those who came to inquire (see note to ver. 5). It may be added that the idea of counsellor seems to be inherent in the word cohen or priest, as in 2 Samuel 8:18; 1 Kings 4:5, etc. Ten shekels - a little over a pound of our money, but probably equivalent to £20, when considered relatively to articles of consumption. A suit of apparel. There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of the word rendered suit in this connection. The word means anything arranged, i.e. put in a rank, or row, or order. In Exodus 40:23 it is applied to the shewbread: \"He ordered the bread in order.\" Thence it came to mean the estimation or worth of a person or thing - some-what as we use the word rank. From this last sense some interpret the word here to mean the worth or price of his clothes. Others, including St. Jerome and the Septuagint, interpret it a pair of vestments, meaning summer and winter clothing. But perhaps the A.V., suit, meaning the whole set of under and upper garments, is after all the best interpretation. The Levite went in. The Hebrew is went, i.e. according to the common use of the word, went his way. And such is probably the meaning here. He went his way to consider the proposal made to him. The result is given in the next verse: And the Levite was content, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then said Micah, etc. We may notice this incidental proof that the Levites in the time of Micah held the religious position which is ascribed to them in the Pentateuch. I have a Levite. Rather, the Levite, meaning the particular Levite of whom it is the question. A Levite would be without the article, as in ver. 7, or would be expressed as in Judges 19:1 (Hebrews), a man a Levite.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In those days, etc. See Judges 17:6. The tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance, etc. This does not mean that the whole tribe of Dan were still seeking their inheritance. The bulk of the tribe, as we read in Joshua 19:40-48, did receive their inheritance by lot before the death of Joshua (ibid. ver. 49) and Eleazar (ibid. ver. 51). But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity. This is in part accounted for by what we read Judges 1:34, that the Amorites would not suffer the children of Dan to come down to the valley, so that those who could not get possession of their land there would be crowded into other parts of the tribal territory. These Danites, of whom we are here reading, were dwelling in Zorah and Eshtaol (Judges 13:1, 25), as we see by vers. 2, 11.

The words the land must be supplied after the analogy of Numbers 34:2. What follows in this chapter is a more detailed account of what was briefly mentioned in Joshua 19:47, where, however, the A.V. went out too little for them is not a translation of the Hebrew text, which is very difficult to explain. Houbigant, by an ingenious conjecture, gives the sense was too narrow for them. Prom the mention of this migration in the Book of Joshua, it is probable that it took place not many years after Joshua's death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - They came to Mount Ephraim (Judges 17:1, 8). The hill country of Ephraim would be on their way to the north from Eshtaol. They would naturally avoid the plain where the Amorites and Philistines were strong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When. Rather, while. By the house. Rather, in or at the house. They knew the voice, having, as some think, known him before he left Bethlehem, or perceiving a southern accent. But it may merely mean that they discerned his voice as he was singing or reciting prayers in the house of God. Micah's house seems to have been a collection of houses (vers. 14, 22), approached by one gateway (ver. 16), in one of which the Levite dwelt. They turned in thither. This seems to have been next morning, when they were starting on their journey. Hearing the Levite's voice, they turned aside into his house. What makest thou, etc. Rather, What doest thou in this place? and what is thy business here?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And I am his priest, or, to be his priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Ask counsel of God, or simply Ask God, as the identical phrase is rendered in Judges 1:2, where see note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the priest said, etc., having first, it is to be presumed, put on the ephod (see Judges 8:26, 27, note; Judges 17:5). Before the Lord is your way, i.e. he looks upon it with favour, has respect unto it, and will make it successful, as it is said in Psalm 34:15: \"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous.\" \"Whether,\" says Bishop Patrick, \"he had any answer from the teraphim, or feigned it out of his own head, is uncertain.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - To Laish. Called in Joshua 19:47 Leshem, which is perhaps a corruption caused by the statement that they called it after the name (Ke-shem) of Dan, or it may be only another form. The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into Oulamais, and in Joshua 19:47 into Lesem-dan. St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has Lesem Dan. Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to. Tyre, on one of the sources of the Jordan. Robinson identifies it unhesitatingly with Tell-el-Kady, \"the mount of the judge\" (where Kady has the same meaning as Dan), close to the great fountain, \"one of the largest fountains in the world,\" called el-Leddan, which is the source of the lesser Jordan (Josephus), and which may very possibly be the ultimate form of ed-Dan, corrupted into Eddan, el-Eddan, Led-dan, el-Leddan, by successive incorporations of the article el into the word itself, of which there are other examples. The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: \"And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, 'quiet and secure, and none doing any injury to any one in the land, possessing wealth;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.\" The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word dwelling is in the feminine gender, agreeing with people, the words quiet and secure and possessing are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, \"dwelling in security,\" \"quiet and secure,\" and for the poetical character of the phrase \"possessing wealth,\" and for the unusual form of the word here rendered wealth (etzer with an ain, instead of the usual otzar with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of wealth from collecting, from which the common word atzereth derives its meaning of a collection or congregation of people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - To go, and to enter. The exact meaning is, Be not slothful to go (i.e. to go on your way from hence), so as to enter in and possess the land. This would be expressed by leaving out to before enter - to go and enter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Translate, \"When ye come, ye shall come unto a people secure; and the land is very large (for God hath given it into your hands), a place where there is no want,\" etc. The Hebrew of very. large is, literally, wide on both hands. The parenthetic for God hath given it into your hands, merely explains why they speak so confidently about it (cf. Deuteronomy 8:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The family - meaning the tribe (see Judges 13:2, note, and cf. Joshua 7:17). Possibly a reason for the use of the word family here and in ver. 2, as applied to Dan, may be that there was only one family in the tribe of Dan, that of the Shuhamites (Numbers 26:42). Six hundred men. With their wives and sisters and children (see ver. 21), the whole company, must have amounted to two or three thousand souls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Kirjath-jearim (city of forests), otherwise called Kirjath-Baal and Baalah, in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:60). It, lay on the border of Benjamin (Joshua 18:14, 15). Its modern representative in all probability is Kurit-el-enab, nine miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Joppa. The district is still very woody. Mahaneh-dan, i.e. the camp of Dan (see ch. 13:25). Behind, i.e. to the west cf. The exact site of Mahaneh-dan has not been identified with certainty. Mr. Williams was shown a site called Beit-Mahanem in the Wady Ismail which answers well in position, but it has not been noticed by any other traveller ('Dictionary of Bible').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In these houses, showing that Beth-Micah, the house of Micah, was in fact a small village (see ver. 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Even unto the house, etc. Rather, at Beth-Micah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Went up, viz., into the upper chamber, where it appears the chapel wan So we read in 2 Kings 23:12 that there were altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz (cf. Jeremiah 19:13). And came up, and took. There is no and in the Hebrew, and the tense of the verb is changed. A fuller stop must be put after went up. And then the account proceeds, with a certain solemnity of diction, They came in thither; they took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image (full stop). The narrative goes on, Now the priest was standing in the entering of the gate, etc. But these five went into Micah's house, etc., as just related, and of course brought them out to the gate where the priest was standing with the 600 Danites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The carved image. It should be the graven image, as elsewhere. The Hebrew text here has the graven image of the ephod, as was noticed in Judges 17:3, note. But it is very possible that the ray, and, has fallen out of the text by accident, and it does not seem likely that a different phrase should be adopted in this one place from that followed throughout in the enumeration of the articles in Micah's chapel, so that the A.V. is probably right. Then said the priest, etc. When he saw the idols and teraphim in the hands of the five men he cried out in alarm. It is remarkable that here and in the preceding verse he is styled the priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Lay thine hand upon thy mouth. Cf. Job 21:5; Job 29:9; Job 40:4. A father and a priest. See Judges 17:10, note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The priest's heart was glad, etc. The prospect of greater dignity and greater emolument stifled all sentiments of gratitude and loyalty to Micah, and made him cheerfully connive at an act of theft and sacrilege.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They turned, i.e. turned their backs upon Beth-Micah, and went on their way to the north. The little ones. The term necessarily includes the women of the emigrant party. Compare Jacob's care for his wives and children (Genesis 33:1-5); only Jacob expected an attack from Esau in front, the Danites an attack from Micah from behind. The carriage. It is the same word as is translated in Genesis 31:1 glory; it might be rendered valuables. It would no doubt include the precious images and ephod which they had just stolen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The houses near to Micah's house. See ver. 14, note. Year to, the same Hebrew word as is rendered by in ver. 3, where see note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - That thou comest, etc. - literally, that thou art gathered together, the same word as in ver. 22. It is the idea of the clan, or family, or tribe which causes the phrase. Just as Israel or Judah designates the whole nation, or the whole tribe, under the name of their patriarch, so here Micah would include all the clan who dwelt in Micah's house; and hence the Danites speak of Micah being gathered together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - My gods, or, as some render it, my god. But the plural is probably right, as Micah was thinking of the molten and graven images, and the teraphim, and called them gods, without perhaps meaning to imply that there was any God but Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Run upon thee. Rather, run, or fall, upon you; it is the plural pronoun, comprehending the whole party. The argument of the Danites was the argument of the stronger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The verse tells us what the two parties did, but not in the Order in which an English writer would express it; for no doubt the Danites, encumbered with their women, and children, and baggage, did not go on their way till Micah and his party had turned back, though in English the contrary order is rather implied. The Hebrew merely puts the actions side by side, and leaves the order to be inferred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And they. In the Hebrew the they is emphatic. It would be better expressed in English by repeating The children of Dan. The repetition of the epithets quiet and secure, as applied to the people of Laish, rather seems to indicate the writer's reprobation of the deed as cruel, like that of Simeon and Levi in slaying Hamor and Shechem. They smote them with the edge of the sword - a phrase denoting an exterminating slaughter (Exodus 34:26; Joshua 19:47; 1 Samuel 15:8, etc.). And they burnt the city, etc. Perhaps they had made the people and city a cherem, a devoted thing, and therefore slew the one and burnt the other (cf. Numbers 21:3; Joshua 8:19; Joshua 11:11, etc.); or the burning of the city may have been one of the means by which they destroyed the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Because it was far, etc. He reverts again to the description given in ver 7. That lieth by Beth-Rehob. It is literally, which belongeth to Beth-Rehob, i.e. the valley here spoken of was part of the territory of the Syrians of Beth-Rehob in the time of David (and very likely earlier), as we read in 2 Samuel 10:6. It seems to have taken its name, House of Rehob, from Rehob the father of Hadadezer, king of Zobah (2 Samuel 8:12), and to have been called Beth-Rehob very much as Micah's settlement was called Beth-Micah. It was also called for shortness Rehob, as Numbers 13:21; Judges 1:31; 2 Samuel 10:8. It was situated, as we learn from Judges 1:31, in the bounds of the tribe of Asher, in the extreme north of the Holy Land, near the entering in of Hamath, the site of which, however, is unknown (see Numbers 13:21). The valley is that through which the Leddan fountain flows (ver. 7, note), and is the upper part of the plain called el-Hulleh, which is the northern continuation of the Jordan valley. They built a city. Rather, they rebuilt the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Howbeit Laish was the name, etc. The strange form here given in the Septuagint, Oulamais, arises from their having taken the Hebrew word for howbeit (oulam) as part of the name, and left out the L of Laish (see ver. 7, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - And the children of Dan, etc. It was probably the long existence of this semi-idolatrous worship of the graven image at Dan that induced King Jeroboam to set up one of his golden calves at Dan, as we read 1 Kings 12:28-30. And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh. The Hebrew text really has the son of Moses. But a little n is written above the line between the M and the S of Moses (Mosheh), so as to be read Manasseh, as thus: MSH; so that they avoided the pain of reading aloud that the grandson or descendant of Moses was an idolatrous priest, without actually altering the written text. It is indeed most sad that it should have been so, though like examples are not wanting, as, e.g., the sons of Eli and of Samuel. For Gershom the son of Moses see Exodus 2:22; Exodus 18:3; 1 Chronicles 23:14-16. It does not follow that Jonathan, the priest of the Danites, was literally the son of Gershom. It may merely mean that he was of the family of which Gershom was the head. Until the day of the captivity of the land. There is great diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this phrase. Many understand it, as is the obvious meaning of the words, of the Assyrian captivity (2 Kings 15:29; 2 Kings 17:6). But some of the best commentators, as Kimchi among the Jews, and many moderns, think it refers to the taking captive of the ark by the Philistines in the days of Eli, because this is the time indicated in the next verse by the mention of the house of God in Shiloh. The ark of God never returned to Shiloh after it was taken thence (1 Samuel 4:3, 4) and captured by the Philistines (ibid. ver. 11). It is also noticed that the expression, The ark of God is gone into captivity (is taken, A.V.), occurs in 1 Samuel 4:21, 22. It certainly would be strange that one verse (30) should speak of the worship of the graven image lasting till the Assyrian conquest of the land, and the next verse (31) limit it to the time that the house of God was in Shiloh, some 300 years earlier. At the same time it should be noticed that ver. 30 speaks of the time that Jonathan's sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, and ver. 31 of the worship of Micah's image. It is quite possible that the descendants of Jonathan may have been appointed priests at Dan to Jeroboam's golden-calf worship, though the original graven image of Micah may have been destroyed by Saul or David; and in the interval between such destruction of Micah's image and the setting up of Jeroboam's calves they may have been the priests of an irregular worship on a high place at Tell-el-Kady. And this would enable us to give what is certainly its natural meaning to the words, \"the captivity of the land.\" But no certainty can be arrived at without more actual knowledge. Many commentators adopt Houbigant's conjecture to read ark for land at the end of ver. 30 (aron for aretz). Others think that some deportation of the Danites by the Syrians or other neighbouring people not recorded in history is here spoken cf. All the time the house of God, etc. This must have been written not earlier than the time of Samuel, and possibly much later. The house of God, i.e. the tabernacle, was in Shiloh from the days of Joshua (Joshua 18:1) till the days of Eli (1 Samuel 1:3), after which we have no account of where the house of God was till the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by King David from the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (2 Samuel 6:12), and placed in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it (2 Samuel 6:17); but whether this was the tabernacle that had been pitched at Shiloh or a new one does not appear. It is not improbable that Samuel may have moved the tabernacle from Shiloh to Ramah (1 Samuel 7:17). The ark had rested in the house of Abinadab at Baaleh or Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (1 Samuel 7:2) previous to its removal by David.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges18:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Judg.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When there was no king (Judges 17:6; Judges 18:1; Judges 21:25). It appears from Judges 20:27, 28 that the events narrated in these three last chapters of the Book of Judges happened in the lifetime of Phinehas, and while the ark was at Shiloh (see Judges 20:27, note). Phinehas evidently outlived Joshua (Joshua 24:29, 33), though there is no evidence to show how long. The events in these chapters must have occurred in the interval between the death of Joshua and the death of Phinehas. A certain Levite, etc. It is a curious coincidence that both the Levite whose sad story is here told, and the Levite the son of Gershom of whom we read in the preceding chapters, were sojourners in the hill country of Ephraim, and also closely connected with Bethlehem-judah. Perhaps the legitimate inference (see ver. 18, and Judges 20:26, 27) is that in both cases the Levites were drawn to Ephraim by the ark being at Shiloh, and also that there was a colony of Levites at Bethlehem-judah. Whether there was any connection between the presence of Levites at Bethlehem and the annual sacrifice at Bethlehem which existed in David's time, and which argues the existence of a high place there, can only be a matter of conjecture (see 1 Samuel 9:13, and 1 Samuel 20:29). All we can say is that there was the universal prevalence of high-place worship during the time of the judges, and that the services of Levites were sought after in connection with it (Judges 17:13). On the side. Hebrew, sides. In the masculine form the word means the hip and upper part of the thigh; in the feminine, as here, it is applied only to inanimate objects, as a house, the temple, a cave, the north, a pit, a country, etc., and is used in the dual number (see 1 Samuel 24:4; 1 Kings 6:16; Psalm 48:3; Psalm 128:3; Isaiah 37:24; Ezekiel 32:23, etc.). It means the innermost, hindmost, furthermost parts. Its application here to the northern side of Ephraim seems to imply that the writer wrote in the south, probably in Judah. A concubine. An inferior wife, who had not the same right for herself or for her children as the wife had (see Genesis 25:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Played the whore, etc. Perhaps the phrase only means that she revolted from him and left him. Her returning to her father's house, and his anxiety to make up the quarrel, both discourage taking the phrase in its worst sense. Four whole months. Literally, days, four months; meaning either a year and four months, as in 1 Samuel 27:7, where, however, the and is expressed; or days (i.e. many days), viz., four months. For the use of days for a year see Exodus 13:10; Judges 17:10, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To bring her again. So the Keri. But the Cethib has to bring him, i.e. it, again, viz., her heart. But the phrase to speak to her heart is such a common one for to speak friendly or kindly to any one that it is not likely that it should here be used otherwise, so that the pronoun should refer to heart. If the masculine is here the right reading, it may be an archaism making the suffix of the common gender like the plural suffix in ver. 24, which is masculine, though applied to women, and like the masculine pronoun itself, which is so used throughout the Pentateuch and elsewhere (see also Judges 21:12; Exodus 1:21). A couple of asses. One for himself and one for her. He rejoiced. No doubt, in part at least, because the expense of his daughter's maintenance would be transferred from himself to his daughter's husband.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Retained him.

He had not at first intended to stay on, but to go on his way after he had eaten and drunk (ver. 5). But when they had prolonged their carousal, the father of the damsel persuaded him to stay on another night.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He lodged there again.

And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And they tarried. It should rather be rendered in the imperative mood: And tarry ye until the afternoon. So they did eat both of them. The imperative comfort thine heart is in the singular because only the man and the father-in-law are represented throughout as eating and drinking both of them together. The imperative tarry ye is in the plural because it applies to the wife as well as the man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Draweth toward evening. The Hebrew phrase, which is uncommon, is, The day is slackening to become evening, i.e. the heat and the light of the day are becoming slack and weak, and evening is coming on. The day groweth to an end. Another unusual phrase; literally, Behold the declining of the day, or, as some render it, the encamping of the day, as if the sun after his day's journey was now pitching his tent for the night. Go home. Literally, to thy tent, as in Judges 20:8. So the phrase, To your tents, O Israel, means, Go home (see 1 Kings 12:16, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Jebus. See Judges 1:21, note. Jerusalem is numbered among Joshua's conquests at Joshua 10:23; Joshua 12:10. But from this verse it would appear that the Israelite population had withdrawn and left the city to be entirely occupied by the Jebusites, who held it till the time of David (2 Samuel 5:6). Jerusalem is only about two hours from Bethlehem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Gibeah (or ha-Gibeah, the hill).. In the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28); Saul's birthplace. Its modern name is Jeba It would be about two and a half hours' further journey from Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Ramah (ha-Ramah, the height). Now er-Ram, less than an hour's journey from Gibeah, both being about equi-distant from Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A street of the city. Rather, the broad space or place near the gate, such as is usual in an Oriental city (cf. Ruth 4:1). There was no man that took them into his house. This absence of the common rites of hospitality toward strangers was a sign of the degraded character of the men of Gibeah (see Genesis 18:3-8; Genesis 19:2, 3; Romans 12:13; Hebrews 13:2; 1 Peter 4:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Which was also of mount Ephraim. The Hebrew is, And the man was from the hill country of Ephraim. It does not mean that he also, as well as the Levite, was from Ephraim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The side of mount Ephraim. See ver. 1, note. I am going to the house of the Lord, i.e. to the tabernacle at Shiloh. But some translate the words I frequent, am conversant with, walk in, the house of the Lord, i.e. am a Levite. But the former seems the best rendering on the whole.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Yet there is both straw, etc., i.e. he only wanted shelter, he had all his provisions with him, it was but little that he asked for, and yet no man would take him in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They washed their feet. See Genesis 18:4; Genesis 19:2; Luke 7:34; 1 Timothy 5:10, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Making their hearts merry - as in vers. 6, 9, and in Judges 16:25; Ruth 3:7. But there is nothing in the expression implying any excess in drinking. Bring forth the man. The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in Genesis 19. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah. Surely this shows the wisdom of the command to destroy utterly the workers of abomination. Sons of Belial. See Judges 20:13, where the same Hebrew phrase is rendered children of Belial. Belial in this common phrase is not a proper name, but a noun meaning worthlessness. Sons or men of Belial means worthless fellows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He pleads the sanctity of hospitality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The man took his concubine, etc. One's blood boils at such selfish baseness and such cowardly cruelty. It is not quite clear whether the man means the Levite or the old Ephraimite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Till it was light, or, as the words may mean, at daylight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The woman was fallen down at the door, etc. Poor thing! with her last breath she turned to the house where he was who should have been her protector, but who had deserted her in her hour of need.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Compare 1 Samuel 11:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges19:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And it was so, etc. Some translate this verse quite differently. They understand the whole verse as what the Levite said when he sent the twelve pieces of the murdered woman to the twelve tribes, as thus: \"He sent her into all the coasts of Israel (ver. 29), saying, It shall come to pass that all who see it will say, There hath been nothing done and nothing seen like this from the day, etc. But the A.V. makes very good sense, and the Hebrew will bear it. Consider of it, etc. The general sense of the whole nation was to call a national council to decide what to do. The Levite had succeeded in arousing the indignation of the twelve tribes to avenge his terrible wrong.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - After the death of Joshua. The events narrated in chs. 1. and Deuteronomy 2:1-9 all occurred before the death of Joshua, as appears by Judges 2:8, 9, and by a comparison of Joshua 14:6-15 and Joshua 15:13-20. The words, and it came to pass after the death of Joshua, must therefore be understood (if the text is incorrupt) as the heading of the whole book, just as the Book of Joshua has for its heading, \"Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass.\" Asked the Lord. The same phrase as Judges 18:5; Judges 20:18, where it is rendered asked counsel of. So also Numbers 27:21, where a special direction is given to Joshua to make such inquiries as that mentioned in this verse before Eleazar the priest, through the judgment of Urim and Thummim (cf. 1 Samuel 23:10, 12). A still more common rendering of the Hebrew phrase in the A.V. is \"to inquire of God\" (see, e.g. Judges 20:27, 28; 1 Samuel 22:13, 15; 1 Samuel 23:2, 4; 1 Samuel 28:6, and many other places). Such inquiries were madeNEWLINENEWLINE(1) by Urim and Thummin,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by the word of the Lord through a prophet (1 Samuel 9:9), orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) simply by prayer, (Genesis 25:22), and improperly of false gods (2 Kings 1:2, 16), of teraphim, and semi-idolatrous priests (Judges 18:5, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Bezek. The site of it is unknown; it is thought to be a different place from the Bezek of 1 Samuel 11:8. Adoni-bezek means the lord of Bezek. He was the conqueror of seventy petty kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Cut off his thumbs, etc. These cruel mutilations, like the still more cruel one of putting out the eyes (Judges 16:21; Numbers 16:14; 1 Samuel 11:2; 2 Kings 25:7), were intended to cripple the warrior in his speed, and to incapacitate hint from the use of the bow, or sword, or spear, while yet sparing his life, either in mercy, or for the purpose of retaining his services for the conqueror.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 1:8-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me.

It is the continuation of the narrative of the exploits of Judah and Simeon in conquering their respective lots.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The valley, i.e. the Shephelah, or lowlands, between the mountains and the coast of the Mediterranean, occupied by the Philistines.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hebron See Numbers 13:22; Joshua 14:13-15; Joshua 15:13-19. Hebron was the burial-place of Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 23:2, etc.; Genesis 25:9), of Isaac and Rebekah, and of Jacob and Leah (Genesis 35:27-29; Genesis 49:31; Genesis 50:13), and the mosque, within whose massive walls the tombs of Abraham and the other four above mentioned are still preserved with the utmost reverence, is the most remarkable object in the modern city, which is called El-Khalil (the friend), after Abraham, the friend of God. A very interesting account of the Prince of Wales's visit to the Mosque of Hebron in 1862 is given in Dean Stanley s 'Sermons in the East.' David reigned in Hebron seven years and six mouths before he transferred the seat of power to Jerusalem (see 2 Samuel 2:1, etc.; 2 Samuel 5:1-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Caleb's younger brother. See note on Judges 3:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - She moved him, etc. There is some obscurity in this verse, which seems to tell us that Achsah, on her wedding-day, when she was going to her husband s house, persuaded him to ask of her father the field, viz. that in which the springs of water were, and which were not included in her original dower; and then goes on to tell us that Achsah herself made the request. The Septuagint reads, \"Othniel urged her to ask the field of her father,\" and the Vulgate has, \"Her husband told her to ask her father,\" and then it follows naturally, \"and she lighted from off her ass,\" etc. But the Hebrew reading may be right, and it may be that when her husband, brave in storming a city, but timid in asking a favour, hung back, she, with the tenacious will of a woman, sprang off the ass herself, and successfully preferred her request. Dean Stanley identifies (though not with absolute certainty) the \"field thus obtained by Achsah with an unusually green valley amidst the dry, barren hills of the south country, lying south or west of Hebron, called Wady Nuukur, through which Caleb and Achsah must have ridden on their way from Hebron to Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This valley breaks into a precipitous and still greener ravine, and both the upper and lower pastures are watered by a clear, bubbling rivulet, which rises in the upper meadow, and flows to the bottom of the ravine below. The name of a village, Dewir, seems to represent the ancient Debir.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The children of the Kenite, etc. It appears from this verse that the invitation given by Moses to his \"father-in-law,\" or rather \"brother-in-law,\" Hobab, to accompany him and the Israelites to the land of promise, though at first rejected (Numbers 10:29, 30), was eventually accepted. Hobab and his tribe, a branch of the Midianites, called Kenites, from an unknown ancestor, Kain, at first settled in the city of palm trees, i.e. Jericho (Deuteronomy 34:3); but it seems that when Judah started on his expedition with Simeon to conquer the south laud, the Kenites went with him. A subsequent migration of a portion of this nomadic tribe is mentioned (Judges 4:11). Dwelt among the people, i.e. the people of Judah. For Arad see Numbers 21:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Judah went with Simeon. In ver. 3 Simeon went with Judah, because the places which follow were all in Judah's lot; but now we read, Judah went with Simeon, because Zephath or Hormah was in Simeon's lot (Joshua 19:4). For Hormah, identified by Robinson (2:181) with Es-sufeh, see Numbers 21:3. The Hebrew verb for \"they utterly destroyed\" is the root of the name Hormah, i.e. utter destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Gaza, etc. Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron, were all cities of the Philistines. But though Judah took these cities, it seems he was not able permanently to expel the inhabitants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Chariots of iron. The chariots of the Canaanites were very formidable to the Israelites, who had no means of coping with them. Thus we are told of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazer, that he had 900 chariots of iron, and mightily oppressed the children of Israel. They were later an important part of King Solomon's army (1 Kings 10:26). See too Joshua 17:16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They gave Hebron, etc. Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, an Edomitish tribe, was one of the spies sent up to spy the land, and in doing so he came to Hebron, and there saw the giants, the sons of Anak (Numbers 13:22). When all the spies brought up an evil report of the land, and by doing so raised a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, Caleb the Kenezite, alone with Joshua, stood firm, and, as a reward of his faithfulness, received the promise that he and his seed should possess the land on which his feet had trodden. Accordingly Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the Kenezite (see Numbers 13, 14; Deuteronomy 1:36; Joshua 14:6-15; Joshua 15:13, 14).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 1:21-36NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This verse is identical with Joshua 15:63, except that there we read \"the children of Judah\" instead of \"the children of Benjamin,\" as in this verse. The boundary line between Judah and Jerusalem passed through JEBUS or JEBUSI, as Jerusalem was anciently called (see Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:28; Judges 19:10, 11; 1 Chronicles 11:4, 5). Jebus was not finally held by the Israelites till the time of David (see Judges 19:10, note.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The house of Joseph, i.e. Ephraim, but probably ,,here spoken of as \"the house of Joseph because in the original document, from which both this chapter and Joshua 15:63, and 16, 17. are taken, the mention of \"the lot of the children of Joseph\" occurs, embracing both Ephraim and Manasseh. See Joshua 16:1 and Joshua 15:23, with which the twenty-first and twenty-second verses of this chapter are manifestly identical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Bethel, now Beitin. The name (house of God) had been given by Jacob (Genesis 28:19), but obviously would not be likely to be adopted by the Canaanitish inhabitants, by whom it was called Luz. As soon, however, as the Ephraimites conquered it, they reimposed the name, in memory of their father Jacob. The Saxon charters exhibit an analogous change in such transitions of name, as that from Bedericksworth to Bury St. Edmunds, which took place after the transfer of St. Edmund's body to the church there, the old name continuing for a time along with the new one, but at last disappearing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - We will show thee mercy. Compare the saving of Rahab alive, with all her house, at the taking of Jericho (Joshua 6:23). This history is not preserved in the parallel place in Joshua 16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Put the Canaanites to tribute, or made them tributaries, as in vers. 30, 33, i.e. imposed forced labour upon them, as the Gibeonites were made hewers of wood and drawers of water (Joshua 9:21, 27; see 1 Kings 9:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites. In verses 29 and 30 it was said that the Canaanites dwelt among the Israelites; but here we read that the Asherites, and in ver. 33 that Naphtali, dwelt among the Canaanites, which seems to imply that the Canaanites were the more numerous people of the two, yet the Israelites were able to keep them in subjection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges1:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The going up to Akrabbim. See Joshua 15:3, Maaleh-acrabbim. In Numbers 34:4 \"the ascent of Akrabbim.\" The whole name, put into English, is \"the ascent, or going up, of Scorpions,\" a mountain pass so called from the abundance of scorpions found in the whole region. The exact locality is uncertain, but it is thought to be the pass El-Safeh, immediately to the south of the Dead Sea. The neighbourhood to Mount Hor and Petra is indicated by its connection here with \"the rock,\" in Hebrew has-selah, which is the distinctive name of the rocks or cliffs on which Petra is built, and the name of Petra (the rock) itself. Speaking roughly, a line drawn westward from El-Safeh to the Mediterranean Sea, near the \"river of Egypt,\" formed the southern boundary, of Judah, and of the Amorites whom they displaced. The battle with the Amorites (Deuteronomy 1:44), in which the Israelites were discomfited and pursued, is thought to have been at El-Safeh.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Went out, i.e. from their several homes to the place of meeting. The congregation. The technical term (not, however, found in Samuel and Kings, except in 1 Kings 12:20) for the whole Israelitish people (Exodus 12:3; Exodus 16:1, 2, 9; Leviticus 4:15; Joshua 18:1, etc.). From Dan to Beersheba. Dan, or Laish (Judges 18:29), being the northernmost point, and Beersheba (now Bir-es-saba, the springs so called) in the south of Judah the southernmost. It cannot be inferred with certainty from this expression that the Danite occupation of Laish had taken place at this time, though it may have done so, because we do not know when this narrative was written, and the phrase is only used as a proverbial expression familiar in the writer's time. The land of Gilead. In its widest sense, meaning the whole of trans-Jordanic Israel (see Judges 10:8; Judges 11:1, etc.). Mizpeh, or, as it is always written in Hebrew, ham-Mizpeh, with the article (see Judges 21:1). The Mizpeh here mentioned is not the same as the Mizpeh of Judges 10:17; Judges 11:11, 29, 34, which was in Gilead, but was situated in the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:26). That it was a national place of meeting in the time of Samuel is clear from 1 Samuel 7:5-12, and we learn from ver. 16 of that same chapter that it was one of the places to which Samuel went on circuit. We find it a place of national meeting also in 1 Samuel 10:17, and even so late as 2 Kings 25:23, and in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:46). Its vicinity to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was, was probably one reason why it was made a centre to the whole congregation (see especially 1 Samuel 10:17, 22, 25). Its exact site is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be that of Nebi Samuil, from which Jerusalem is seen at about two hours' distance to the south-east. Unto the Lord, i.e. in the presence of the tabernacle, which was doubtless brought there, on so solemn an occasion, from Shiloh (cf. Exodus 34:34; Leviticus 1:3; Judges 11:11; Judges 21:2, and ver. 26 of this chapter).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The chief. The word here used means the corner-stones of a building. Hence it is applied to the chief men, who, as it were, bind and keep together the whole people. Their presence at this great meeting is mentioned to show that it was a regularly constituted assembly of all Israel. The same phrase occurs 1 Samuel 14:38, and Isaiah 19:13 (the stay of the tribes, A.V.). The numbers (400,000) are of course those of the whole congregation. The assembly of the people of God. So, Numbers 16:3; Numbers 20:4, Israel is called the congregation of the Lord; and Nehemiah 13:1, the congregation of God. Not dissimilar was the first great council of the Church, consisting of the Church (ἡ ἐκελησια) i.e. the assembly of disciples) and the apostles and elders (who were the cornerstones, the lapides angulares, thereof). See Acts 15:4, 6, 12. Four hundred thousand. See ver. 17. The enumeration in the wilderness gave 603,550 (Numbers 2:32; Numbers 11:21), and at the second numbering 601,730 (Numbers 26:51). In 1 Samuel 11:8 a general assembly of the whole people, summoned by sending a piece of the flesh of a yoke of oxen \"throughout all the coasts of Israel,\" amounted to 330,000. David's numbering gave of Israel 800,000, and of Judah 500,000, in all 1,300,000; but these were not assembled together, but numbered at their own homes. Jehoshaphat's men of war amounted to 1,160,000 according to 2 Chronicles 17:14-18. In the time of Amaziah there were of Judah alone 300,000 men able to go forth to war (2 Chronicles 24:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The children of Benjamin heard, etc. This seems to be mentioned to show that the absence of the Benjamites from the national council was not from ignorance, but from contumacy. Tell as, etc. This was addressed to all whom it might concern.

This was so far true that it is likely he was in fear of his life; but he doubtless shaped his narrative so as to conceal his own cowardice in the transaction. We have a similar example of an unfaithful narration of facts in the letter of Claudius Lysias to Felix (Acts 23:27). The men of Gibeah. The masters, as in Judges 9:2, meaning the citizens.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Ye are all children of Israel.

As one man. There was but one resolve, and one sentiment, and one expression of opinion, in that vast multitude. Not one would go home till due punishment had been inflicted upon Gibeah of Benjamin. To his tent, i.e. home, as in Judges 19:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - We will go up by lot against it. The words we will go up are not in the Hebrew, but are supplied by the Septuagint, who very likely found in their Hebrew copy the word na'aleh, we will go up, which has since (perchance) fallen out of the Hebrew text from its resemblance to the following word 'aleha against it. The sense will then be, Not one of us will shrink from the dangers of the war; but we will cast lots who shall go up against Gibeah, and who shall be employed in collecting victuals for the army, 40,000 having to be told off for the latter service. And exactly in the same spirit (if indeed the answer was not actually given by lot) they inquired of the Lord who should go up first (in ver. 18), and, we may presume also, who should follow in the subsequent attacks, though this is omitted for brevity. Others, however, think the words against it by lot are purposely abrupt, and that the meaning is that Israel would deal with Gibeah as they had done with the Canaanites, viz., destroy their city, and divide its territory by lot among the other tribes, after the analogy of Joshua 18:8-10. But this interpretation is not borne out by what actually happened, nor is the phrase a likely one to have been used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Tribe of Benjamin. The Hebrew has tribes, meaning probably families, as the word is used Numbers 4:18. Vice versa, family is used for tribe, Judges 17:7; Judges 18:11. What wickedness, etc. The message was perhaps toe sharp and peremptory to be successful. It roused the pride and tribal independence of the Benjamites to resist. We must suppose the message to have preceded in point of time the hostile gathering recorded in ver. 11. It was probably sent before the council broke up (see above, Judges 7:25; Judges 8:4, and note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Children of Belial. See Judges 19:22, note. There seems to be a reference here to Deuteronomy 13:12-15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But the children of Benjamin. It should be And the children, etc. It is not dependent upon the preceding verse, but begins a new head of the narrative. From the cities, i.e. the different cities of the tribe of Benjamin, enumerated in Joshua 18:21-28, twenty-six in number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Twenty and six thousand. The numbers of Benjamin in the wilderness were at the first numbering 35,400, and at the second 45,600 (Numbers 1:36; Numbers 2:23; Numbers 26:41). It is impossible to account with certainty for the falling off in the numbers by so many as near 20,000; but perhaps many were slain in the wars of Canaan, and the unsettled times were unfavourable to early marriages. For the whole of Israel there was, as appeared by ver. 2, note, a falling off of nearly 200,000 men, or, to speak exactly (601,730-400,000 +26,700), of 175,030. Which were numbered. There is some obscurity in this latter clause; but, in spite of the accents being opposed to it, the A.V. seems certainly right. The rendering acording to the accents, \"they (the Benjamites) were numbered, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, seven hundred chosen men,\" makes no sense, and does not explain who the 700 were. The population of Gibeah would be about 5 × 700, i.e. 3500, according to this statement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Seven hundred... men left-handed. It is curious that the tribe of Benjamin, which means son of the right hand, should have this peculiar institution of a corps of left-handed men. Ehud the Benjamite was a man left-handed (Judges 3:15; see also 1 Chronicles 12:2). The Roman name Scaexola means left-handed. For the use of the sling see 1 Samuel 17:40, 49. Diodorus Siculus (quoted by Rosenmuller) mentions the remarkable skill of the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands in the use of the sling, adding, in terms very similar to those of the text, that they seldom miss their aim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A repetition of the statement in ver. 2.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 20:18-48NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The house of God. In this rendering the A.V. follows the Vulgate, which has in demure Dei, hoc est, in Silo. But the Septuagint has Βαιθὴλ, and all the ancient authorities, as well as modern commentators, generally agree in rendering it Bethel. The reason, which seems a conclusive one, for so doing is that the Hebrew בית אל invariably means Bethel, and that the house of God is always expressed in Hebrew by בית האלהים (beth-ha-elohim). The conclusion is that at this time the ark of God, with the tabernacle, was at Bethel, which was only seven or eight miles from Shiloh. Bethel would be eight or ten miles from Gibeah, i.e. about half way between Shiloh and Gibeah. Asked counsel. The same phrase as Judges 1:1, where it is rendered simply asked (see note to Judges 1:1, and vers. 23, 47). In following this precedent the Israelites put the men of Gibeah on the footing of the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. With reference to ver. 9, it is worth considering whether this is not the fulfilment of the purpose there expressed by the Israelites, to go up against Gibeah by lot; either by understanding that the answer asked was given by a Divinely-directed lot, according to which Judah's turn came first (see Joshua 7:14-18; 1 Samuel 14:41; Acts 1:24-26; etc.), or by taking the expression by lot in a wider sense, as meaning generally Divine direction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The men of Israel - meaning here of course the men of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Came forth out of Gibeah, etc. Gibeah (sometimes called Geba, literally, the hill) was doubtless very difficult to assault, and the steep approach greatly favoured the defenders. The men of Judah probably came up carelessly, and with an overweening confidence, and so met with a terrible disaster. The word destroyed here used is the same as is applied to the destroying angel (Exodus 12:23; 2 Samuel 24:16; see also 2 Chronicles 24:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And the children of Israel went up and wept, etc. This verse must precede chronologically ver. 22, and explains the circumstances under which the battle referred to in ver. 22 took place. The unexpected repulse they had met with had begun to produce its intended effect. There was a humbling of themselves before God, a brokenness of spirit, a deepened sense of dependence upon God, and a softening of their feelings towards their brother Benjamin. All this was shown as they again went to the tabernacle at Bethel to ask the Lord (ver. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And, or so, repeating what had been said in ver. 22, but giving it this time as the result of God's answer recorded in ver. 23.

The people, as distinguished from the men of Israel, the army, probably means the non-fighting people, the aged, the infirm, women, etc. The house of God. Render, as in ver. 18 (see note), Bethel. Sat there. Sitting with the Jews, especially on the ground, was the attitude of grief and mourning (Job 2:13; Isaiah 47:1, 5; Lamentations 2:10, etc.). The Jews at the present day often sit on the ground at the place of wailing in Jerusalem. Before the Lord, i.e. before the tabernacle (see Judges 11:11, note), Fasted until evening. The usual time for terminating a fast among the Jews, as at the present day among Mahomedans. For similar fasts on solemn occasions of national guilt or grief, see 1 Samuel 7:6; 2 Samuel 1:12; Jeremiah 36:9; Nehemiah 9:1; Joel 1:14, etc. Peace offerings. Usually thank offerings (Leviticus 3; Leviticus 7:11, 12), but applicable to any voluntary sacrifice of which the flesh might be eaten the same day, or the day following, by the offerer (Leviticus 7:15, 16). Doubtless the people at the close of their fast ate the flesh of these peace offerings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Enquired of the Lord. In the Hebrew, Asked the Lord, as in vers. 18, 23. For the ark of the covenant, etc. A most important statement, defining the time of these occurrences, within the lifetime of Phinehas, and also giving a strong intimation that the writer of these words lived after the tabernacle had been removed from Shiloh and its neighbourhood to Jerusalem. Was there. Where? The natural answer to be given is, At Bethel; for Bethel is the only place that has been named. But it is not in accordance with the other intimations given us concerning the tabernacle, that Bethel should be its resting-place under the high priesthood of Phinehas. In Joshua 18:1 we have the formal pitching of the tabernacle of the congregation at Shiloh; in Joshua 22:12 we find it there, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest before it; in 1 Samuel 1:3; 1 Samuel 2:14; 1 Samuel 3:21; 1 Samuel 4:3, we find it settled there till taken by the Philistines; and in Psalm 78:60 we find Shiloh described as the abode of the tabernacle till its capture by the Philistines, and there is no hint anywhere of Bethel or any other place having been the resting-place of the ark before it fell into the hands of the Philistines. Neither, again, is the explanation of some commentators, that the words the ark... was there in those days implies \"that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel,\" at all satisfactory. In those days has naturally a much wider and broader application, like the expression (Judges 17:6; Judges 18:1), In those days there was no king in Israel, and contrasts the time of Phinehas and the judges with the times of the monarchy, when the ark and the high priest were at Jerusalem. Unless, therefore, we understand Bethel in vers. 18, 26, 31 to mean the house of God, which seems quite impossible, we must interpret the word there to mean Shiloh, and suppose that the writer took no count of the temporary removal to Bethel for the convenience of consultation, but considered that it was at Shiloh in one sense, though momentarily it was a few miles off. Possibly too in the fuller narrative, of which we have here the abridgment, the name of Shiloh was mentioned as that to which there referred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?

Here manifestly Bethel, as in the margin. Gibeah in the field. The A.V. is the natural rendering of the Hebrew words, which imply a Gibeah in the field different from Gibeah, as the Septuagint seems to have understood them (Γαβαὰ ἐν ἀγρῷ). It is a happy conjecture, borne out by the existing roads, that this Gibeah-in-the-field is the same as Gobs, now Jeba. Indeed it is almost impossible to conceive how the pursuers, coming out of Gibeah, could be described as coming to two highways, of which one led to Bethel and the other to the very place they had come from. The latest explorers of the district fully concur in this identification of Gibeah-in-the-field with Jeba.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And the children of Benjamin, etc. This verse is parenthetical, being explanatory of the conduct of both parties. The Benjamites pursued recklessly, because they thought the fight was going as on the two previous days; the Israelites fled in order to draw them to the highways, and so to enable the ambushment to get between the Benjamite army and the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Rose up out of their place. The narrative is singularly obscure and broken, and difficult to follow. But the meaning seems to be, that when the Israelite army had reached Baal-tamar in their flight, they suddenly stopped and formed to give battle to the pursuing Benjamites. And at the same time the liers in wait came out from their ambushment and placed themselves in the rear of the Benjamites on the direct road to Gibeah. Baal-tamar, a place of palm trees. The site has not been identified, but may possibly, or probably, be the same as the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel (Judges 4:5). The meadows of Gibeah, Hebrew, Maareh-Geba, may very likely have been, as the Septuagint takes it, a proper name, denoting some locality outside Gibeah (here called Geba) where the ambush was concealed. The meaning of the word maareh is thought to be a bare tract of ground without trees - something like a heath or common. It may have had pits, or deep depressions, where the ambush would be hid both from the city itself and from the high road, or other facilities for concealment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Against Gibeah, i.e. against the army of Gibeah. The sense seems to be that the 10,000 Israelites who had been fleeing before Benjamin, and drawing them away from the city, now faced them, and commenced a resolute attack upon them, which at first the Benjamites, not knowing of the ambushment in their rear met with equal resolution, so that \"the battle was sore.\" But the result, the details of which are given at length in vers. 36-46, was that 25,100 Benjamites fell that day (see ver. 46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-41. - The children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. Not of course after 25,000 of them had been smitten, but at that period of the battle more fully described in vers. 40, 41, when the Benjamites, looking behind them, saw Gibeah in flames, and immediately broke and fled towards the wilderness. In the latter half of this verse and in the following verses to ver. 41 the writer recapitulates all the preceding circumstances, some of which have been already mentioned, which led to the particular incident mentioned in the beginning of the verse, that \"Benjamin saw that they were smitten;\" viz., the feigned flight of the Israelites, the seizing and burning of Gibeah by the liers in wait, the signal of a great smoke, and the turning again of the flying Israelites. It was then that \"the men of Benjamin saw that evil was come upon them,\" and turned their backs and fled. Thus vers. 36 (latter half)-41 bring us back through the details to the identical point already reached at the beginning of ver. 36. In vers. 39, 40 there is another retrograde movement in the narrative, in which the statement of vers. 31, 32 is repeated in order to bring into close juxtaposition Benjamin's keen pursuit of the enemy with his terror when he saw the smoke rising in his rear. Hasted (ver. 37). This is an amplification with further particulars of ver. 33. The liers in wait not only came forth out of their place, but they made a dash to get into Gibeah before the men of Gibeah, who were pursuing the flying Israelites, could be aware of their intention. Rushed upon. Perhaps better rendered fell upon. It is exactly the same phrase as 2 Samuel 27:8, there rather tamely rendered invaded and in ver. 10 made a road. Drew themselves along. Some take the word in the common sense of blowing the trumpet, but it rather means spread themselves out (ἐξεχὺθη, LXX.) through the defenceless city, so as to slay and burn in all parts simultaneously. That they should make a great flame with smoke, etc. (ver. 38). The Hebrew of this verse is difficult to construe, but the A.V. gives substantially the right sense. They seem to be the very orders given to the leader of the ambush. \"Make them (the ambush) multiply to send up (i.e. send up in great quantities) the column of smoke from the city.\" It seems that the appearance of the smoke was the signal for the Israelites to turn (ver. 41). The flame, etc. (ver. 40). Rather, the column began to go up in (or as) a pillar of smoke. The flame of the city. Literally, the whole of the city, meaning of course the whole city in flames.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Therefore they turned their backs, etc. The narrative now at length advances one step. The result of the Benjamites finding themselves between the ambushment and the army of Israel was that they took to flight in an easterly direction (ver. 43) toward the wilderness, i.e. the wilderness described in Joshua 16:1 as \"the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel,\" where the direction of the wilderness relative to Ephraim is also described as being \"on the east.\" In like manner Zedekiah fled towards the plain (arabah) or plains of Jericho - a term nearly synonymous with wilderness (2 Kings 25:4, 5). Them which came out of the cities, etc. This is a very obscure passage, and is very variously explained. Those which came out of the cities must be the same as are so described in ver. 15, and designates the Benjamites who were not inhabitants of Gibeah. The simplest way, therefore, to understand the passage is to render it without reference to the accents: \"And the battle overtook him and those that were from the cities (i.e. the men of Gibeah and the rest of the Benjamites), destroying him (the whole Benjamite army) in the midst of him,\" i.e. going right into the midst of them, and destroying right and left. Some, however, render it in the midst of it, i.e. of the wilderness. The plural participle destroying agrees with the singular noun of multitude, the battle or war, meaning all the men of war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Thus they inclosed, etc. Another difficult passage, having all the appearance of being a quotation from some poetical description of the battle. The tenses of the verbs and the absence of any conjunctions in the Hebrew makes the diction like that of Judges 5:19. The italic words thus and the two ands ought to be omitted, to give the stately march of the original. \"They inclosed, etc.; they chased them; they trod them down,\" etc. They inclosed seems to refer to the stratagem by which the Benjamites were surrounded by the ambush in their rear and the Israelites in front. Then came the pursuit - \"they chased them;\" then the massacre - \"they trod them down.\" The three verbs describe the three stages of the battle. With ease. It does not seem possible that the Hebrew word menuchah can have this meaning. It means sometimes a place of rest, and sometimes a state of rest. Taking the latter meaning, the words they trod them into rest may mean they quieted them by crushing them to death under their feet, or in rest may mean unresisting. Some render it unto Menuchah, as if Menuchah was the name of a place, or from Nochah, as the Septuagint does. Others, at the place of rest, i.e. at every place where they halted to rest the enemy was upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 44-46. - And there fell, etc. The account in ver. 35, anticipating the details of the battle, had already given the gross number of casualties in the Benjamite army on this disastrous day as 25,100. We now have the items of the account, viz., 18,000 in the pursuit, in the open plain; 5000 in the highways, i.e. either the highways mentioned in ver. 31, or, as the expression gleaning rather intimates, the highways by which straggling bodies tried to reach any neighbouring cities after the great slaughter had taken place; and 2000 more who were making from Gidom; in all 25,000, which is only 100 men short of the reckoning in ver. 35. The rock of Rimmon. See ver. 47, note. Gidom. Not elsewhere mentioned, nor identified with any modern name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - But six hundred men turned. If these 600 survivors are added to the 25,000, or 25,100, enumerated as slain (vers. '35, 44), it gives a total of 25,700. But the total number of Benjamites, as given in ver. 15, was 26,700. There remain, therefore, 1000 men unaccounted for. These may, have been killed partly in the two first days successful battles (vers. 21, 25), and partly in the different cities into which they had escaped, when the general massacre recorded in ver. 48 took place. The rock Rimmon. There are two proposed identifications of this place. One makes it the same as Rummon, \"a village perched on the summit of a conical chalky hill,\" \"rising on the south side to a height of several hundred feet from the Wady Muti-yah,\" and defended on the west side \"by a cross valley of great depth,\" which lies three miles east of Bethel, and seven miles northeast of Gibeah (Tulell el-Ful), and is situated in the wilderness between the highlands of Benjamin and the Jordan. This is advocated by Robinson ('Biblical Researches,' 1:440), by Mr. Grove in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and by Lt. Conder ('Quart. State. for July 1880,' P. 173). The other is advocated by Mr. W. F. Birch ('Pal. Expl., Quart. State. for April 1880'). This identifies it with the Wady er-Rummon, discovered by Mr. Rawnsley, where there is a vast cave, Mugharet el Jai, about a mile and a half from Geba, capable, according to the local tradition, of holding 600 men, and used to the present day by the villagers as a place of refuge from the government persecutions According to this view, the statement that they abode in the rock Rimmon is strictly correct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges20:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Turned again, not the same word as the turned of vers. 45, 47, but turned back, came again by the way by which they had gone in pursuit of the Benjamites, and on their return towards Bethel (Judges 21:2) entered into all the Benjamlte cities, which lay thick together east and north of Gibeah, and ruthlessly put all the remaining population to the sword; burning all the cities, and treating the whole tribe of Benjamin, with all that belonged to them, as a 'herem, a thing devoted to utter destruction, like Jericho.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now the men of Israel, etc. A circumstance not mentioned before is now brought forward, as is another in ver. 5, on which the events about to be narrated in this chapter depend, viz, that the men of Israel had taken two solemn oaths at Mizpeh (Judges 20:1) - the one that no Israelite would give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite; the other that whosoever did not come up to the national assembly there should be put to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the people, etc. The narrative now proceeds. After the people, i.e. the Israelite army, so described Judges 20:3, 8, 22, etc., had finished the work of destruction in the cities of Benjamin, they returned to Bethel (the house of God, A.V., here and in Judges 20:18, 26, 31, where see notes), and, their rage having now subsided, gave way to violent grief on account of the destruction of Benjamin their brother. With passionate Oriental feelings they passed the whole day weeping, and probably fasting (see ch. 20:26), before the tabernacle. Wept sore. Hebrew, wept a great weeping. The expression lifted up their voices shows that it was a loud wailing and lamentation,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And said. Better, And they said. One tribe lacking. The existence of the twelve tribes was an essential part of their covenant existence as the people of God (Genesis 35:22; Genesis 49:28; Exodus 24:4; Numbers 1:5-15; Joshua 4:3, 4, etc.; Matthew 19:28; James 1:1; Revelation 7:4, etc.). With one tribe missing Israel would be no longer Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4.- Offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the children of Israel said. The idea evidently occurred to them that they might supply wives to the 600 Benjamites in the way that actually came to pass, and they asked the question, Who is there among all the tribes, etc., with this view.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-9. - And the children of Israel, etc. This verse goes back a little to explain why the children of Israel asked the question, viz., because they repented them for Benjamin, and wished to repair the mischief resulting from their rash oath not to give their daughters to a Benjamite; therefore they said (repeating ver. 5), What one is there that came not up to Mizpeh? (ver. 8) and on numbering the people it was found that no one had come up from Jabesh-gilead. This is the first time that Jabesh-gilead is mentioned in Scripture. It comes up twice afterwards. First in 1 Samuel 11, on occasion of its being besieged by the Ammonites and rescued by Saul; and secondly in 1 Samuel 31:11-13, when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shah, and buried them at Jabesh, for which brave and pious act David thanked them (2 Samuel 2:5). The name of Jabesh is only preserved in the Wady Yabis, which debouches on the eastern bank of the Jordan about lat. 32'24. Robinson thinks the ruins called ed Deir in this valley are the remains of Jabesh, which agrees exactly with the situation assigned to it by Eusebius in the , Onomasticon.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD?

They followed in the severity of the punishment the precedent of the destruction of the Midianites (see Numbers 31:17), and even in the numbers sent to destroy them - a thousand from every tribe (Numbers 31:5). Revolting to our feelings as such wholesale massacres are, including women and children, it must be remembered in mitigation that the 'hereto was the solemn devotion of a thing or person to destruction under the sanction of an oath. Of the valiantest. The sons of valour simply means valiant men (2 Samuel 13:28; 2 Samuel 17:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To Shiloh, whither it should seem they had now taken the tabernacle back, the war with Benjamin no longer requiring its presence at Bethel Them. It is masculine in the Hebrew, though it refers to the women. So again in ver. 22, their fathers and their brothers in the masculine (see above, Judges 19:23, and vers. 21, 22). It is perhaps an archaism. In the land of Canaan. This is inserted to contrast it with Jabesh in Gilead (Genesis 33:17, 18, and ch. 8:5, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Translate the whole verse thus: And the whole congregation sent and shake to the children of Benjamin, etc., and proclaimed peace to them (see Deuteronomy 20:10). They sent ambassadors or heralds to them as it were with a flag of truce.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Benjamin came again, i.e. returned to their own homes in the tribe of Benjamin, as in ver. 23. Yet so they sufficed them net - or, Yet so they (the Israelites) did not provide enough for them (the Benjamites); or, Yet so they (the Benjamites) had not enough for themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Seeing the women. It is rather more in accordance with the Hebrew style to take the words as the narrator's explanation of the question, What shall we do? They said this because all the women of Benjamin had been destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin. The passage is difficult to construe and to explain. If the words There must be are properly supplied in the A.V., the sense will come out more clearly if we take the word inheritance to mean rather succession, which is the idea contained in the root. There must be a succession for the escaped of Benjamin, i.e. there must be heirs to succeed, and therefore we must find wives for them. The word peleytah without the article can hardly mean the remnant, as has been proposed, but must be defined by being taken with Benjamin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - We are not able. Note again the evil of rash vows, and how often chicanery is necessary in order to evade their evil consequences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - There is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly. Compare the exactly similar description, 1 Samuel 1:3, 7. There is a great difference of opinion among commentators as to what feast is here meant. Hengstenberg, Keil, Delitzsch, and others think it was the passover; Bishop Patrick and others think it was the feast of tabernacles, a more joyous feast; Rosenmuller and others think it was a festival peculiar to Shiloh, after the analogy of the yearly sacrifice of the family of Jesse at Bethlehem (1 Samuel 20:29), and more or less in accordance with Deuteronomy 12:10-12. It is not easy to say which view is right, but the last seems not improbable, In a place which is on the north side, etc. The words in a place are not in the Hebrew, and do not seem to be implied by the context. But the description is that of the situation of Shiloh itself, which is very exact (see 'Palestine Exploration Fund,' Map of West Palestine). Lebonah survives in el-Lubbun, about two miles north-west of Seilun, and to the west of the road to Shechem or Nablus. It seems strange that so particular a description of the situation of Shiloh should be given; but it may probably indicate that the writer lived after the tabernacle had been moved to Jerusalem, and Shiloh had relapsed into an obscure village (see Judges 20:27, note). The situation of the descriptive words in the Hebrew, with the pronoun which, separated from Shiloh by the word yearly, indicates that they are an explanation added by the narrator.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Come out. The verb is in the masculine gender, though the daughters of Shiloh is the subject (see above, ver. 12, note), To dance in dances. Bishop Patrick says that the feast of tabernacles was the only feast at which Jewish maidens were permitted to dance. Go to the land of Benjamin. The close vicinity of the high road leading from Shechem to Bethel on the border of Benjamin would facilitate their flight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Be favourable unto them for our sakes. Rather, Grant us them as a favour, the masculine them referring to the daughters of Shiloh, as in ver. 12, and the verb grant a favour being followed by a double accusative. We reserved not to each man his wife, etc. These words are somewhat difficult. If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before each man (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the to is not natural in such a phrase (Numbers 26:54 is hardly to the point, nor is Genesis 41:12, where the to had been expressed before the us), and reserved is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: \"We received not each man his wife in the war.\" Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, \"Grant them to us,\" etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, \"because THEY received not each man his wife,\" etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. Ye did not give, etc., i.e. you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not give your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force. The A.V. gives the probable meaning of the passage, though it is somewhat obscure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - According to their number, i.e. so as to provide the 200 with wives.

Rather, the angel of the Lord, i.e. the angel of his presence, whose message consequently is delivered as if the Lord himself were speaking (see Genesis 16:7, 9, 11, etc.). A good example of the difference between a message delivered by a prophet and one delivered by the angel of the Lord may be seen by comparing Judges 6:8 with Judges 6:11-16.

This is not a translation of the Hebrew text, which only has \"for sides,\" but a partial adaptation of Joshua 23:13, where the phrase is \"scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes.\" Either the words for \"scourges in\" have fallen out of the text, or the word here rendered \"sides\" should be rendered, as some think, \"enemies.\" A snare.

It probably includes some forty or fifty years from the entrance into Canaan, viz., about thirty years of Joshua's lifetime, and ten, fifteen, or twenty years after Joshua's death. The record of the people's continuance in the service of the Lord connects itself with the promise made by them in Joshua 24:21, 24.

Probably, though not certainly, the modern Tibneh, six miles from Jifna. It is called in Joshua 19:50 and Joshua 24:30 Timnath-serah, the letters of which are identical, but the order is inverted. Timnath-heres is probably the right form. It means \"The portion of the Sun.\" We have Mount Heres in Judges 1:35, near Ajalon. Ir-shemesh (city of the sun) and Beth-shemesh (house of the sun) are other instances of places called from the sun. Some have supposed some connection between the name Timnath. heres, as Joshua's inheritance, and the miracle of the sun standing still upon Gibeon at the word of Joshua (Joshua 10:12, 13). The neighbourhood of Timnath-heres to Ajalon (Judges 1:35) may give some countenance to this.

We may notice by the way the value to the Church of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in keeping alive a perpetual memory of Christ's precious death until his coming again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They forsook the Lord, etc. Here again there is a manifest allusion to Joshua 24:16, 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Baal and Ashtaroth. Ashtaroth is the plural of Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians (1 Kings 11:5, 33), just as Baalim (ver. 11) is the plural of Baal. The many images of Baal and Ashtoreth are, in the opinion of some, indicated by the plural; but others think that different modifications or impersonations of the god and goddess are indicated. Thus we read of Baal-berith, the god who presides over covenants; Baal-zebul, or Zebub, the god who presides over flies, who could either send or remove a plague of flies, and so on. \"Baal (lord or master) was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, as Ashtoreth (perhaps the star, the planet Venus) was their supreme female divinity. Baal and Ashtoreth are frequently coupled together. Many Phoenician names - Hannibal, Asdrubal, Adherbal, Belus, etc. - are derived from Baal.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:14-23NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - The anger of the Lord, etc. These verses contain an awful view of the wrath of God excited by wilful sin, and are a practical illustration of Exodus 20:5: \"I am a jealous God.\" Compare Psalm 79:5, which shows how closely allied the notions of anger and jealousy are in Hebrew. He sold them. A forcible expression, implying the handing over of the people into the hands of their enemies, as if God had no more any property in them or concern about them; as if he said, \"Ye are not my people, and I am not your God;\" as if he said to the heathen, \"Take them, and do as you will with them; they are yours, not mine\" (see Leviticus 26. and Deuteronomy 28.).

Hence the name of this book, which recites the names and exploits of those whom God raised up to deliver them out of the hand of their enemies. The title Judges (Hebrew, shophetim) is, as is well known, identical with the Carthagenian suffetes. Mark the riches of God's mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - To walk therein. The Hebrew has in them. Probably for way we should read ways, as Deuteronomy 8:6; Deuteronomy 10:12, etc. This verse does not seem to be part of what the Lord said, but to be the comment of the writer. The A.V. - that through them I may prove - inserts an I which is not in the original. Ver. 22 depends upon ver. 23. The literal rendering is, For the sake of proving Israel, etc.... the Lord left those nations. The writer, after rehearsing the Lord's reason for not completing the extirpation of the nations after the death of Joshua, adds the further information why they had not been delivered into Joshua's hand in his lifetime (cf. Joshua 3:1, 4). In Exodus 23:29, 30; Deuteronomy 7:22, an additional reason is given for the gradual extirpation of the Canaanites - \"lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Judg.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now these are the nations, etc. We are now told in detail what was stated in general in Judges 2:22, 23, after the common method of Hebrew narrative. To prove Israel. This word to prove is used here in a somewhat different sense from that which it bears in ver. 4 and in Judges 2:22. In those passages it is used of their moral probation, of proving or testing their faith and obedience; but here it is rather in the sense of \"to exercise\" or \"to accustom them,\" to train them to war. A considerable period of rest had followed Joshua's conquest, during which the younger Israelites had no experience of war; but if they were to keep their hold of Canaan, it was needful that the warlike spirit should be kept up in their breasts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNamely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The five lords, etc. The title seren, here rendered \"lord,\" is one exclusively applied to the lords of the five Philistine cities enumerated in Joshua 13:3; 1 Samuel 6:17, 18, viz., Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. It occurs repeatedly in ch. 16; 1 Samuel 5, 6, 29, etc. The word means an axle-tree. The entering in of Hamath. There are two theories in regard to Hamath. Some, as Professor Rawlinson in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' identify it with Hamah, a large and important city on the Orontes in Upper Syria, and consider that the kingdom of Hamath, which was overthrown by the king of Assyria (2 Kings 18:34; 2 Kings 19:13), and of which Hamath was the capital, was for the most part an independent Hamitic or Canaanite kingdom (Genesis 10:18), but occasionally, as in the days of Solomon and Jeroboam (1 Kings 8:65; 2 Kings 14:28; 2 Chronicles 8:4), subject to Israel Others, however, justly considering the great improbability of the Israelite dominion having ever extended so far north as the valley of the Orontes, and observing how it is spoken of as an integral part of Israel (1 Kings 8:65), look for Hamath much further south, in the neighbourhood of Beth-rehob (see Judges 18:28, note). As regards the phrase \"the entering in of Hamath,\" the identical Hebrew words occur seven times, viz., Numbers 13:21; Numbers 34:8; Joshua 13:5; in this passage; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Kings 14:25; 2 Chronicles 7:8, and are variously rendered in the A.V.: \"as men come to Hamath;\" \"unto the entrance of Hamath;\" \"the entering into Hamath;\" \"the entering in of Hamath (three times); and the entering of Hamath.\" The exact meaning of the phrase seems to be \"the approach to Hamath,\" some particular spot in the valley from whence the direct road to Hamath begins; very much like the railway term for certain stations which are the nearest to, though at some little distance from, the place from which they are named, as, e.g., Shapwick Road, Mildenhall Road, etc. The latter words of the verse describe the territory of the Hivites, which reached from Mount Baal-hermon in the Lebanon range as far as the point where the road leads to Hamath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Canaanites, etc. The same enumeration of the tribes of the Canaanites as in Exodus 34:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They took their daughters, etc. Here is a further downward step in the disobedience of the Israelites. Intermarriage with the Canaanite nations had been expressly forbidden (Exodus 34:15, 16; Deuteronomy 7:3; Joshua 23:12), and the reason of the prohibition clearly stated, and for some time after Joshua's death no such marriages appear to have been contracted. But now the fatal step was taken, and the predicted consequence immediately ensued: \"they served their gods;.., they forgat the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 3:7-11 This section introduces us into the actual narrative of the Book of Judges, the prefatory matter being now concluded. The whole book proceeds on the same model as this section does. The apostasy of Israel; their servitude under the oppressor sent to chastise them; their cry of distress and penitence; their deliverance by the judge raised up to save them; the rest which follows their deliverance. There is infinite variety in the details of the successive narratives, but they are all formed on the same plan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The groves. The Asheroth, here and elsewhere (Judges 6:25, 26; Deuteronomy 16:21, etc.)wrongly rendered groves, were large wooden images or pillars in honour of Ashtoreth, and so are properly coupled with Baalim. This verse is in fact identical in meaning with Judges 2:13, of which it is a repetition (see note to Judges 2:13, and Judges 8:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8.- Chushan-rishathaim, i.e., as usually explained, Chushan the victorious, or the wicked. His name, Chushan, or Cushan, points to Cush, the father of Nimrod (Judges 3:9NEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A deliverer. Hebrew, Saviour, as ver. 15 (see Nehemiah 9:27). Othniel, etc. Mentioned Judges 1:13; Joshua 15:17, and 1 Chronicles 4:13, where he is placed under \"the sons of Kenaz,\" and seems to be the father of Hathath and Meonothai. According to Judith 6:15, he had a descendant, Chabris, living in the time of Holofernes. The Hebrew, though grammatically it favours the view that Othniel was the brother of Caleb, does not absolutely exclude the rendering that Kenaz was his brother, and so Othniel his nephew. Compare Jeremiah 32:7, where the words \"thine uncle\" apply to Shallum, not to Hanameel, as is clear from ver. 8. And as the chronology seems to make it impossible that Othniel should be Caleb's brother, since Caleb was eighty-five years old at the time of Othniel's marriage, and Othniel therefore could not be less than fifty-five, an improbable age for his marriage; and since, again, Othniel could not well have been less than eighty at Joshua's death, which, allowing only ten years for the elders, and reckoning the eight years for Chushan's dominion, would make him ninety-eight when he was raised up to deliver Israel, it is a lesser difficulty to take Othniel as the nephew of Caleb, by understanding the words, Caleb's younger brother, to apply to Kenaz. But perhaps the least objectionable escape from the difficulty is to take the phrase in its most natural grammatical sense, but to understand the word brother in its wider and very common sense of kinsman or fellow-tribesman. They were both sons of Kenaz, or Kenizzites. Caleb was the head of the tribe, and Othniel was next to him in tribal dignity, and his junior in age, but probably succeeded to the chieftainship on Caleb's death. This would leave the exact relationship between Caleb and Othniel uncertain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the Spirit, etc. This marks Othniel as one of the extraordinary Shophetim, or judges, Divinely commissioned to save Israel (see Judges 6:34; Judges 11:29; Judges 13:25; Judges 14:6, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And Othniel, etc. The arrangement of this verse suggests that Othniel lived through the whole forty years of rest, but this is highly improbable. The first part of the verse only belongs to the preceding section, which it closes quite naturally. The result of Othniel's victories was a rest of forty years (cf. ver. 30; 5:31; 8:28, etc.). The latter half of the verse - And Othniel the son of Kenaz died - begins a new section, and is introductory to the first apostasy, which followed after his death.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 3:13-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The children of Ammon. The technical name of the Ammonite people (see Genesis 19:38; Deuteronomy 2:19, 37; Judges 10:6, 11, 17, etc.). Sometimes, however, they are called Ammon, or Ammonites (see Deuteronomy 23:3; 1 Samuel 11:11, etc.). Amalek, or the Amalekites, were the hereditary enemies of Israel (see Exodus 17:8-16; Judges 5:14; Judges 6:3, 33; Judges 7:12; 1 Samuel 15:2, etc.). The Amalekites appear, from Genesis 36:12, to have been a branch of the Edomites, and the latest mention of them in the Bible finds a remnant of them in the neighbourhood of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah (1 Chronicles 4:41-43). The city of palm trees, i.e. Jericho, as Deuteronomy 34:3; Judges 1:16. Jericho was the first city in Canaan which any one crossing the fords of the Jordan would come to (see Joshua 2:1; Joshua 6:1, etc.). Though no longer a fenced city, it was important from the fertility of the plain, and from its commanding the fords.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Left-handed. It was a peculiarity of the warriors of the tribe of Benjamin to be left-handed (see Judges 20:16; 1 Chronicles 12:2). A left-handed man wearing no sword or dagger on his left side, and using his right hand for other purposes, would naturally throw a man off his guard. Thus Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him, and then smote him with the sword in his left hand (2 Samuel 20:10). A deliverer. Hebrew, a saviour (ver. 9). A present, i.e. their tribute.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The quarries. It is uncertain whether this is the meaning of the Hebrew word. Its common meaning is images, as Deuteronomy 7:25, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For himself alone. It seems to have been Eglon's habit to sit quite alone in this summer parlour for coolness sake, his attendants waiting in the adjoining antechamber. On this occasion he appears to have dismissed them from the antechamber, for greater privacy, while Ehud spake to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The haft, etc. Ehud, feeling the necessity of killing Eglon at one blow, plunged the dagger into his body with such force that the handle went in with the blade, and he was unable to draw it out. Leaving it, therefore, buried in his fat, he went out at once into the parshedon, or antechamber, for so it is best to render the last words of the verse, and thence into the misederon, the outer porch, having first locked the door of the summer chamber. The words parshedon and misederon occur only here, and the former is very variously rendered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24.- Covereth his feet, i.e. is asleep (see 1 Samuel 24:3).

The quarries. See above, ver. 19. Seirath, or rather has-seirah, is not known as the name of a place. It seems to mean the rough or woody district, the forest in the hill country of Ephraim, where there was good shelter to hide in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He blew a trumpet. Like Alfred in the marshes of Somerset, he gathered a host around him in the shelter of the forest; and then, full of faith in his Divine mission, \"strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,\" dashed down boldly into the plain, and, seizing the fords, cut off all communication between the Moabites at Jericho and their countrymen east of the Jordan. They could neither escape into Moab nor get help from Moab. Thrown into confusion by the death of their king and the suddenness of the attack, the Moabites fell to the number of 10,000 men; and so ended the second servitude, to be followed by a rest (if the numeral in the text is sound) of eighty years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges3:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.

This is an isolated movement of the Philistines, alluded to in Judges 10:11, but of which we have no further details. In Judges 10:6 we read of Israel worshipping the gods of the Phllistines, and of an alliance between the Ammonites and Philistines to vex Israel; but the precise connection between the events of the two chapters, or the exact time when either occurred, cannot be determined with certainty. Nothing more is known of Shamgar, except the mention of him in Deborah's song (Judges 5:6).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Sold them. See Judges 2:14, note. Jabin king of Hazor. The exact site of Hazor has not been identified with certainty, but it is conjectured by Robinson, with great probability, to have stood on the Tell now called Khuraibeh, overlooking the waters of Merom (now called Lake Huleh), where are remains of a sepulchre, Cyclopean walls, and other buildings. In Joshua 11:1-14 we read of the total destruction by fire of Hazor, and of the slaughter of Jabin, the king thereof, with all the inhabitants of the city, and of the slaughter of all the confederate kings, and the capture of their cities; Hazor, however, \"the head of all those kingdoms,\" being the only one which was \"burnt with fire.\" It is a little surprising, therefore, to read here of another Jabin reigning in Hazor, with confederate kings under him (Judges 5:19), having, like his predecessor, a vast number of chariots (cf. Judges 4:3, 13 with Joshua 11:4, 9), and attacking Israel at the head of a great force (cf. Judges 4:7, 13, 16 with Joshua 11:4). It is impossible not to suspect that these are two accounts of the same event. If, however, the two events are distinct, we must suppose that the Canaanite kingdoms had been revived under a descendant of the former king, that Hazor had been rebuilt, and that Jabin was the hereditary name of its king. Gentiles, or nations, or Goim, as Joshua 12:23, and Genesis 14:1.

Heber, with a portion of the tribe, had migrated later to Naphtali, probably at the time When the Philistines were pressing hard upon Judah, in the days of Shamgar and Jael (Judges 3:31 and Judges 5:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Unto the river (or brook) of Kishon, now the Nahr Mukutta. In the plain of Esdraelon, through which the Kishon flowed into the Mediterranean, there would be room for all his chariots to come into action.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And Deborah, etc. Observe how throughout Deborah takes the lead as the inspired prophetess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15.- The Lord discomfited, etc. Deborah had announced that the Lord was gone out before the host of Barak, and so the victory was not man's, but the Lord's. \"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Barak pursued after the chariots. Barak, supposing Sisera still to be with the chariots, pursued after them, and seems to have overtaken them, as they were embarrassed in the rotten, boggy ground which had been suddenly overflowed by the swollen waters of Kishon. Many were swept away by the flood and drowned, the rest put to the sword while their horses were floundering in the bog (Judges 5:21, 22). But Sisera had meanwhile escaped on foot unnoticed, and fled to the tents of the friendly Kenites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - With a mantle. Rather, \"with the coverlet,\" such as was always at hand in the nomad tent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - A little water. Faint and thirsty as he was, he did not ask for strong drink, but only water.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Then Jael, etc. Sisera, having taken every precaution, had lain him down to rest; not, like David, trusting to the Lord to make him dwell in safety, but confiding in Jael's friendship and his own crafty directions. But no sooner had he fallen into a deep sleep, than the crafty and courageous woman, into whose hands Sisera was to be sold, took a tent pin and the heavy hammer with which they drove the pin into the ground, and with a desperate blow forced it through his temples, and pinned him to the ground. Without a struggle, he swooned and died. Instead of and fastened it into the ground, it is better to translate, that it (the pin) came down to the ground. It is the same word as is translated lighted Joshua 15:18. In the last clause put the full-stop after asleep, and read, So he swooned and died. It is impossible for us to view Jael's act in the same light as her contemporaries did, on account of its treachery and cruelty; but we can admire her faith in the God of Israel, her lave for the people of God, and her marvellous courage and strength of mind in carrying out her purpose, and make allowance for the age in which she lived.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.

Exodus 15:1, 21). It is a song of wonderful beauty and lyric power, somewhat difficult, as all Hebrew poetry is.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Her first feeling was one of patriotic joy that her countrymen had been roused to the venture of war, and of gratitude to God that it was so. \"For the bold leading of the leaders of Israel, for the willing following of the people, praise ye the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Her song was worthy to be listened to by kings and princes.

She specifies the march from Seir or Her, and the day when Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, and the whole mount quaked greatly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - From what misery God had saved the people! In the days of her predecessor Shamgar, when the Philistines overran the country, when Heber the Kenite still dwelt in the south of Judah, all traffic ceased in the land. The caravans were stopped, and travellers slunk into the by-ways.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Instead of The inhabitants of the villages ceased, some render the leaders ceased.

Then their enemies were let loose upon them, and they dared make no resistance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people.

For archers some give the interpretation dividers, i.e. MEN SHARING THE BOOTY THEY HAVE TAKEN; or, SINGING IN ALTERNATE VERSES. For They that are delivered from, some render far away from. Others again take the preposition from in the not uncommon sense of more than, meaning here louder than. The chief different senses which emerge are -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that of the A.V.: \"Those that can now draw water from the wells without being molested by the hostile archers shall sing praises to God in the very spots where they were wont to be attacked.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"Far from the noise and tumult of those that divide the spoil among the water-troughs, there shall they sing, - etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"With a louder voice than that of the shepherds who sing among the water-troughs (while they are watering their flocks), there shall they rehearse,\" etc. Or,NEWLINENEWLINE(4) combining (2) and (3), \"With a voice louder (and more exultant) than that of those who divide the spoil, there shall they rehearse,\" etc. The inhabitants of his villages.

Then she lashed her soul into action, and roused Barak from his lethargy by the promise of spoil and victory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then he gave dominion to a mere remnant of Israel over the powerful among the people of Canaan, the Lord gave me dominion over the mighty men of Jabin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They who spring (whose root is) from Ephraim went against Amalek, following thee, O Benjamin, with thy people; from Manasseh (Machir, son of Manasseh, Genesis 50:23) came down governors (literally, lawgivers: cf. ver. 9), and out of Zebulun they that handle the baton of the commander, i.e. the military chiefs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley.

These words may mean,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) they did not stop to plunder, they were intent only upon slaughter; or,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) they took no ransom for their enemies' lives; or,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) they got nothing by their fighting, for they were all killed themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - According to Josephus, a great storm in the face of the Canaanites led to their utter discomfiture, and also swelled the Kishon to overflow its banks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Ancient. The word so rendered is only found here. The brook of ancient days, or things, probably means the brook celebrated from of old by the warlike deeds done on its banks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Their mighty ones.

The mighty. Not the same word as that so rendered in ver. 22, but that usually rendered a mighty man, or a man of war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Blessed above women, etc. With the selfish indifference of the men of Meroz she contrasts the valorous enthusiasm of Jael the Kenite, and blesses her for it as emphatically as she curses the inhabitants of Meroz.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A lordly dish.

She smote (not smote off), yea, she wounded (Psalm 68:21); she pierced through his temples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Sped, i.e. come across some booty. For the necks of them that take the spoil. Literally, for the necks of spoil. It is a difficult and obscure expression. The spoil may mean the camels, horses, or mules taken from the enemy, and the articles described may mean the housings and trappings for their necks. Or the necks of spoil might mean the necks of the beasts of burden laden with spoil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.

In Numbers 22:7 we read of the Midianites as allied with the Moabites in their hostility to the children of Israel, and we find them willing agents of Balaam s iniquitous counsels (Numbers 25:6, 17, 18; Numbers 31:7, 8), and suffering a terrible chastisement from the Israelites in consequence. An abiding national feud was the natural consequence; and this, added to their love of plunder, no doubt led to the present invasion in company with the Amalekites (Judges 3:13, note). Observe the contrast between the victory described in Numbers 31. and the defeat narrated in this chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The dens... and caves. In the writer's time certain hiding-places called by the above names were traditionally known as the places where the Israelites took refuge during the terrible Midianite invasion. The limestone hills of Palestine abounded in such caves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Children of the east. We first find this term in Genesis 29:1, where it is applied to the people of Haran. Comparing the analogous phrases, \"the east country\" (Genesis 25:6), the mountains of the east (Numbers 23:7), \"the men of the east\" (Job 1:3), \"the east\" (Isaiah 2:3; Matthew 2:1), we gather that the country lying to the east of Palestine as far as the river Euphrates was called the east country, and that the various tribes of Arabs and others who peopled that desert were called \"the children of the cast\" (see ver. 33 and Judges 7:12; Judges 8:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Left no sustenance, etc., i.e. neither grass, nor corn, nor fruit. It is added, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. These all either died for want of food or were seized by the Midianites. The next verse explains that the enormous multitudes of their cattle and camels consumed the whole produce of the ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As grasshoppers.

I have heard travellers in India describe the sudden darkening of the sky by a flight of locusts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A prophet. Literally, a man, a prophet, just as Deborah was described as a woman, a prophetess (Judges 4:4). It is interesting to observe the flow of the spirit of prophecy in those early days between Moses and Samuel, before the dispensation of the prophets had risen to its height. I brought you up from Egypt. Note the constant reference to the exodus as a fixed point in their national and religious life (see ver. 13; Judges 2:1).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:11-24NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - An angel, etc. Rather, the angel of the Lord, otherwise called \"the angel of his presence\" (Isaiah 63:9). In vers. 14, 16, 23, for the angel of the Lord we have simply the Lord (see Judges 2:1, note). An oak. Rather the oak, or terebinth, as it should be rendered. It was doubtless a well-known tree still standing in the writer's time (see ver. 19). Compare the mention of the oak (terebinth) at Shechem (Genesis 35:4); the great oak (terebinth) in which Absalom was caught (2 Samuel 18:9); Deborah's palm tree (Judges 4:5, where see note). Observe the simple way in which the ministration of the angel is introduced, as if it were a matter of course in the eyes of him who is the Lord of the millions of the heavenly host, those ministers of his who do his pleasure. Human scepticism, the twin sister of human selfishness, would blot out all creation except itself. To hide it, etc. These graphic touches give a lively picture of the straits to which the Israelites were reduced by the Midianite occupation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Appeared. Angels were not always visible when present (see Numbers 22:31; 2 Samuel 24:17; 2 Kings 6:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If the Lord be with us, etc. The utter dejection caused by the Midianite oppression breathes in every word spoken by Gideon. But how reassuring the angel's words were. Which our fathers told us cf. This is a distinct reference to the national traditions, which are elsewhere alluded to (cf. Exodus 12:26, 27; Psalm 44:1; Psalm 78:3-5; Jeremiah 16:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Wherewith shall I save Israel? etc. Compare the unwillingness of Moses (Exodus 3:11; Exodus 4:10, 13), of Saul (1 Samuel 10:21, 22), of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:6), of Amos (Amos 7:14, 15), and of St. Peter (Luke 5:8). Also in ecclesiastical history that of Ambrose, Gregory the Great, and others. The least fit are usually the most forward, the most fit the most backward, to undertake great offices (Judges 9:8-15). True humility is the usual companion of true greatness (see 2 Corinthians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A sign that thou talkest with me - that it is indeed thou thyself that speakest to me, even God, and that there is no illusion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDepart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - My present. Minehah means sometimes a present made to man, as in Judges 3:18; but it more commonly means a sacrificial offering (Genesis 4:3 5), which seems to be its meaning here, as explained vers. 19, 20. When coupled with zevach, the animal sacrifice, minchah means the meat and drink offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Unleavened cakes (Genesis 19:3; 1 Samuel 28:24). The necessary haste gave no time for the use of leaven, which is one explanation of the unleavened bread at the passover (Exodus 12:33, 34, 39). Presented it. A word specially used of sacrifices and offerings (Amos 5:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Lay them upon this rock, as upon an altar, and pour out the broth, as a drink offering or a libation (see Judges 13:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - There rose up fire, etc. The consuming of the sacrifice by fire from heaven was the token of its being accepted (cf. Judges 13:20, 23; also 1 Kings 18:23, 33, 38; 1 Chronicles 21:26). The angel of the Lord departed, etc. In the very similar case of the angel who appeared to Manoah (Judges 13:15-20), the angel ascended in the flame of the altar. It is probable that he did so in the present instance, though it is not expressly stated how he disappeared (cf. Acts 8:39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Gideon perceived, etc. Gideon's suspicious were now turned into a certainty. It was indeed God that had spoken to him by his angel (ver. 17). Alas, etc. Gideon speaks thus in terror of the death which he thought must be the penalty of seeing the angel of the Lord (see Judges 13:22, and note). Because. Rather, therefore, or to this end, viz., that I should die.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Peace, etc. Cf. Daniel 10:19, and John 20:21, 26; Luke 24:36-39. Hence the name of the altar, Jehovah-shalom - \"The Lord is peace,\" is at peace with me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - For naming altars built in commemoration of particular events see Genesis 22:14; Genesis 31:47-49; Genesis 33:20; Joshua 22:34, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The grove. See Judges 3:7. The size of the asherah is indicated by the order in ver. 26 to use it for the altar fire.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:25-32 Verse 25. - The same night, etc. The iron was hot; it was time to strike. As regards what follows, there are two ways of understanding the verse. One, that of the A.V., supposes that only one bullock is spoken of, and that \"the young bullock\" belonging to Joash is further described as \"even the second bullock of seven years old;\" to which it is objected that a bullock of seven years old is not \"a young bullock,\" \"the bullock of an ox,\" as the Hebrew phrase is, and that there is no explanation of the meaning of \"the second bullock;\" and that the Hebrew manifestly describes two bullocks:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Joash's young bullock, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the bullock of seven years old.NEWLINENEWLINEThe other supposes two bullocks, and instead of has the more natural rendering and. The only objection to this, by far the most natural rendering, is that Gideon is not told what to do with the first bullock. But it is a simple explanation that the two bullocks were used in the laborious work of demolishing the altar of Baal, and removing the earth and the stone to build the altar of the Lord, and that when the work was finished one of the bullocks - the seven-year-old - was sacrificed. For the grove see Judges 3:7, note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - This rock. Rather, the keep or stronghold of Ophrah, where also the high place was; just as the temple was in the stronghold of Zion, and the hold of the house of Baal-Berith at Shechem was in the citadel of the place (Judges 9:46). In the ordered place. The meaning of this phrase is uncertain. It may either be rendered as in the A.V., meaning on the levelled ground ordered and prepared for the building of the altar; or it may more probably be rendered with the arranged material, i.e. the stones which were laid in order at the bottom, and the wood which was laid in order upon the top of the altar (cf. Genesis 22:9). The material may either refer to that taken from the altar of Baal, which had been thrown down, and which was then ordered to be used in building the altar of the Lord, or to its own arranged material or superstructure, the wood of the asherah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Then, i.e. the next night. He would have done it the next day; but even his father's household, as well as the men of Ophrah generally, were so infected with the idolatry of the times, that he was afraid of being interrupted by violence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The grove. See ver. 25. The second bullock. There must be some special meaning in this description, the second. Can it refer to his place in the team, the young bullock being the leader, the first, and the seven-year-old the wheeler, the second?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - They said, Gideon hath, etc. No doubt one of the ten servants (ver. 27) employed by him had spoken about it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Stood against him. The words describe their hostile, menacing, attitude, clamouring to have Gideon brought out that they might kill him. Will ye plead, etc. The emphasis is on the ye. Joash met and silenced their pleading by threatening death to any that should plead for Baal. Baal shall plead for himself. Joash's courage was rising under the influence of his son s brave deed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Jerubbaal, i.e. Jarov Baal, let Baal plead. In Judges 7:1; Judges 8:29, 35; Judges 9:1, etc., Jerubbaal is used as the synonym of Gideon, just as in English history Coeur de Lion is used as a synonym for Richard. The name Jerubbaal appears as Jerubbesheth; besheth or bosheth, meaning shame, i.e. a shameful idol, being substituted for Baal, as in the name Ishbosheth, for Eshbaal (see 2 Samuel 2:8; 1 Chronicles 8:33).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:33-40NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The Midianites, etc. See ver. 3, note. The valley of Jezreel. Rather, the plain, \"the great plain of Esdraelon,\" as the Book of Judith styles it (Judith 1:8; see Judges 4:13, note). The great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (which is the Greek form of the name), through which the Kishon flows, is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours (twelve miles) in breadth from north to south. It is described as \"a very extensive and fertile plain shut in between the mountain ranges of Samaria and Mount Carmel on the south, and of Galilee on the north,\" and extending from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of Caipha, or Haipha, to the valley of the Jordan. The access to it from the fords of Jordan in the neighbourhood of Bethshan (or Beishan, called by the Greeks Scythopolis) made it the natural place for invasion by the wild tribes east of Jordan, as it is to this day. Particular parts of this great plain are called \"the valley, of Megiddo\" and \"the plain of Samaria.\" For a full account of the plain of Esdraelon see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 9. Went over, i.e. crossed the Jordan. It appears from vers. 3-5 that these invasions were repeated at certain seasons. When they had plundered all they could get, and eaten up all the produce of the land, they would go back for a while to their own country east of Jordan, and then return again. So they did now, but they met with a different reception this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The Spirit of the Lord, etc. See Judges 3:10; Judges 11:29; Judges 13:25; Judges 14:6, 19; cf. Isaiah 11:2; Isaiah 61:1; John 20:22; Acts 13:2; Acts 20:28; and 1 Corinthians 12:4. Abi-ezer. His own family (ver. 11; see Joshua 17:2). In Numbers 26:30 the name appears as Jeezer, by a very defective transliteration - Aiezer represents the Hebrew letters. The b has probably fallen out by accident. Here we have the immediate fruit of Gideon s daring in the cause of God. The whole family of Abi-ezer, numbering probably thousands, sprang to his side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - He sent messengers, etc. Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali were the adjacent tribes - Manasseh (i.e. the half tribe of Manasseh, west of Jordan) on the south, Asher on the west, and Zebulun and Naphtali on the north. Three of these were the very tribes who had fought under Barak, and it is pleasing to see Asher now joined with them instead of abiding in his breaches. This ready compliance with the call was the consequence of the Spirit of the Lord being upon Gideon. Came up. No doubt Gideon was eneamped upon one of the southern hills that overlooked the plain, probably Gilboa, just as Barak was on Mount Tabor (see ch. 8:8-12). To meet them, i.e. Gideon and the Abi-ezrites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - If thou wilt save, etc. There is something touching in Gideon's diffidence of himself, even now that he found himself at the head of a large force. The thought that he was \"the least in his father's house\" seems still to possess him, and he can hardly believe it possible that he is to save Israel. In his humility he craves a sign that he is indeed chosen and called.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 37-40. - It is difficult to guess what led to this somewhat quaint sign which Gideon asked. Possibly the dews were usually heavy upon the hill of Gilead (Judges 7:3, note) where Gideon was encamped, as they seem to have been on Mount Gilboa (2 Samuel 1:21) and on Hermon (Psalm 133:3), and sheep-skins may have been a common protection against the cold nights, as in Afghanistan; and he may have noticed how often in the morning both the skin that covered him, and the ground around, was wet with the heavy dew. And this may have suggested the double test, by which his faith was, through God's condescending mercy, confirmed and established.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges6:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Judg.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jerubbaal. The mention of this name seems intended to keep before our minds that it is emphatically the servant of the Lord who is going forth to victory. The well of Harod, i.e. of trembling, so called, no doubt, from the incident recorded in ver. 3, that every one who was afraid (Hebrew, hated) departed from Mount Gilead. The well of Harod is not mentioned elsewhere, though two of David's mighty men are called Harodites (2 Samuel 23:25); but it is thought to be identical with \"the fountain which is in Jezreel\" (1 Samuel 29:1), on the slope of Mount Gilboa, and now called Ain Jahlood, the spring of Goliah. On the north side, etc. Gideon and his Abi-ezrites were naturally on the south side of the plain, on the hill, apparently Mount Gilboa, which there shuts in the plain. The Midianitc host was encamped to the north of him (so it is in the Hebrew), in the valley, i.e. the plain of Jezreel (Judges 6:33, note). By the hill of Moreh. Nowhere else mentioned; probably only a hillock, of which there are many in that part of the plain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the Lord said, etc. It must be remembered that this whole movement was essentially a religious one. It began with prayer (Judges 6:6, 7), it was followed up by repentance (Judges 6:27, 28), and the great purpose of it was to turn the hearts of the nation back to the God of their fathers. The Lord himself, therefore, graciously forwarded this end by making it plain that the deliverance from their oppression was his work, and his only. For the general sentiment compare Deuteronomy 8:10-18; Psalm 44:3-8; Zechariah 3:6, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3.- Depart early. The Hebrew word so rendered only occurs here. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but the old versions generally give the meaning of \"depart,\" \"go back.\" Some, with much probability, connect the word with the HebrNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - The water, viz., of the well or spring of Harod. That lappeth, etc. It showed a much more soldierly and self-controlled spirit just to quench the thirst by lapping the water out of the palm of the hand, than to kneel down and drink without stint out of the spring itself. The Lord saw the difference of character indicated by the two actions, and chose his instruments accordingly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - By the three hundred, etc. Compare the saying of Jonathan, \"There is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few\" (1 Samuel 14:6). The same principles which run through the choice of God s instruments on other occasions appear here. The instruments are to be such in quality or in quantity as to make it quite manifest that the excellency of the power is God's, not man's; and yet the instruments themselves are to be conspicuous for their rare excellence. The shepherd boy who sat on the throne of Israel was manifestly made to sit on that throne by the appointment of God; but what a ruler, what a noble character David was! It has always been deemed one of the proofs of the Divine origin of Christianity that its apostles were men of such humble station, and yet were able to change the whole religion and morality of the world; and yet what noble stuff Peter and John and Paul were made of! And so here the overthrow of the hosts of Midian by three hundred Israelites was manifestly the effect of the power of God fighting on their behalf. But yet what marvellous heroism was there in those three hundred! what strength of purpose, what iron-firmness of nerve, to see above thirty thousand of their comrades leave them in the face of the myriads of their foes; to remain quietly at their post, and, when the time came, to leave their camp and pour down into the plain. Their self-possession and self-restraint and absence of self-indulgence in the matter of the water was a true index of the unequalled qualities which they displayed in the sequel. Ver 8. - So the people took, etc. It is almost certain that the passage ought to be rendered, \"And they took the victuals of the people in their hands, and their trumpets,\" i.e. the three hundred took or borrowed what provisions they needed for a few days, and the trumpets, which were to play an important part in the stratagem, from the people who were about to return to their homes. And the host of Midian, etc. The writer repeats this to give a perfect picture of the situation. The whole army returned to their homes; the three hundred alone with Gideon in the camp; the Midianite host in the plain beneath.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:9-25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Get thee down, etc., i.e. attack the camp at once with thy 300 men. But if thou art afraid to do so, go down first alone with Phurah thy servant, and hear what they are saying in the camp.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The armed men. The exact meaning of the word here rendered armed men (chamushim), and which occurs Exodus 13:18; Joshua 1:14; Joshua 4:12, is a little uncertain, but it is generally thought to be synonymous with another word (calutsim), also rendered armed (Numbers 32:32; Deuteronomy 3:18), and to mean literally girded, i.e. prepared to fight. These fighting men, as distinguished from the numbers of the nomads who were with their camels and cattle scattered all along the plain, were all collected in the camp, to the edge of which Gideon and Phurah crept stealthily in the dark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A cake. The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else. Of barley bread. The commonest kind of bread, the food of only the poorer classes, indicating, therefore, the humble origin and station of Gideon. A tent. Rather, the tent; what in a Roman camp would be the pretorium, the general's tent. The words at the end of the verse are heaped up to indicate the total and entire upsetting and overthrow of the tent, symbolic of the rout and destruction of the Midianite host.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This is nothing else, etc. The dream and the interpretation are striking evidences of the terror which Gideon's name had already inspired among the Midianites. Because, although both the dream and the interpretation were of God, for the encouragement of Gideon in his great undertaking, yet they followed the course of nature and the laws of psychology. The presentiment that God had delivered Midian into Gideon's hand is exactly like the terror in the minds of the Canaanites which preceded the arrival of Joshua (Exodus 23:27; Deuteronomy 2:25; Deuteronomy 11:25; Joshua 2:9-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It was so, etc. The effect upon Gideon was like magic. He not only learnt the state of panic in which the Midianites were, but he had a further certainty that God was with him. His simple piety and adoring gratitude threw him at once upon his knees to thank God, and to cast himself anew upon his strength with un-doubting trust. His hands were indeed strengthened, and he lost not a moment in returning to his 300, relating in a few words the incident of the dream, and bidding them follow him. The Lord hath delivered, etc. Cf. 1 Samuel 14:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Trumpets, which had been collected from the whole army (ver. 8, note). Lamps. Rather, as in the margin, torches, within the pitchers, so as not to be seen till the pitchers were broken, when the torches would flare with a sudden blaze. The pitchers were vessels for drawing water, as appears from Genesis 24:14, 16, 18, 20. They were doubtless of earthenware, as they were so easily broken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The sword of the Lord, etc. The word sword is not in the original here, though it is in ver. 20. It has either dropped out of the text accidentally, or what we have here is the shorter form of the war-cry. It is observable how careful Gideon is to put the name of Jehovah first. It was his cause against Baal, and the battle was to be fought in his strength, and the glory of the victory was to be his. The cry, \"The sword of Gideon,\" would be peculiarly terrible to the many who had heard of the dream, of which the fulfilment was come so quickly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The middle watch. The ancient Israelites divided the night into three watches of four hours each, from sunset to sunrise, i.e. from six p.m. to six a.m. The first watch, from six to ten, is not mentioned in the Old Testament; but we have the middle watch mentioned here (from ten to two), and the morning watch (from two till six): Exodus 14:24 and 1 Samuel 11:11. According to this, Gideon's attack would have taken place soon after ten p.m., or towards eleven, the time when the sleep would be the deepest, the watchmen of the first watch having lately fallen into their first sleep. The later Israelites adopted the Roman division of the night into four watches (Matthew 14:25; Mark 6:48; cf. Luke 12:38; Mark 13:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They stood, etc. Gideon's men did not advance, but stood, each company in the place assigned to them, at different sides of the-camp. This had the effect of awakening the whole camp simultaneously, and they started to their feet and ran hither and thither in confusion, shouting as they went. Undisciplined troops, especially excitable Orientals, are very liable to be thus thrown into a panic. Fled. The Cethib has, caused to fly, i.e. either \"put to flight,\" or \"carried away,\" as in Judges 6:9; Exodus 9:20. In the former case the nominative must be the Israelites; in the latter, their tents, herds, stuff, etc., must be understood. Both are very awkward. The Keri, fled, is probably right, unless caused to fly has the sense of \"bid them fly,\" in which case the preceding word, cried, might be taken in its common sense of they sounded an alarm. The whole clause would then run thus: And all the camp ran; and they sounded a retreat, and bid them flee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Blew the trumpets, etc. Hearing the confusion, the three companies blew their trumpets, probably more loudly than before, to give the impression of a hot pursuit being at hand. The Midianites, thinking the enemy were upon them, and not being able in the dark to distinguish friend from foe, mistook their flying comrades for pursuing Israelites, and fell upon and slew one another. In like manner the Philistines had done when attacked by Jonathan and his armour-bearer (1 Samuel 14:20), and the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites when attacked by Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20:23). Beth-shittah. House of acacias. The exact situation of it, and of Zererath and Tabbath, is unknown. They must have been villages lying on the route from the plain of Esdraelon to the banks of Jordan, probably between Little Hermon on the north and Mount Gilboa on the south, where there was a very ancient high road from Jezreel to the Jordan by Beth-sham Indeed it is highly probable that Shuta, a village mentioned by Robinson, marks the site, as it retains the name of Beth-shittah. For Zererath some read, with some of the old versions and manuscripts, Zeredath (r and d being scarcely distinguishable in Hebrew), and identify it with Zarthan near Succoth, mentioned Joshua 3:16 and 1 Kings 4:12; 1 Kings 7:46. Abel-meholah (the meadow of the dance) was the birthplace of Elisha (1 Kings 19:16), and is mentioned in conjunction with Beth-shan, Jezreel, and Zartana in 1 Kings 4:12. Eusebius tells us that in his time Abel-meholah was called Beth-maiela, and situated ten miles below Beth-shan, or Scy-thopolis. There was also, he says, close by an Abel-maiela.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The men of Israel, etc. Gideon's disbanded army got together again very quickly when they heard of the flight of the Midianites. Zebulun is not mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Mount Ephraim. Rather, the hill country, of Ephraim. For some reason Gideon had not invited the Ephraimites to join in the war before (Judges 8:1); but now, seeing the extreme importance of seizing the fords of Jordan, so as to stop the escape of the Midianites, he sent messengers in all haste to the men of Ephraim, who accordingly \"took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.\" The waters seem to mean a number of streams running from the hill country of Ephraim into the Jordan, and which had to be crossed by the Midianites before they could reach the Jordan fords. The site of Beth-barah is unknown. It is not thought to be the same as Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptising (John 1:28). Beth-barah must have been on the west of Jordan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Oreb, a raven, and Zeeb, a wolf. The rock known afterwards as the rock of Oreb (Isaiah 10:26), and the wine-press (see Judges 6:11) known as the wine-press of Zeeb, were so called from being the places where these two princes were taken and slain by the Eph-raimites. In like manner the well of Harod is called by the name it afterwards received (ver. 1), and the palm tree of Deborah in like manner (Judges 2:5), and Lehi (Judges 15:9). These are valuable indications (to which many more might be added) of a living tradition older than the written history. The capture of Oreb and Zeeb is celebrated in Psalm 83:11 and Isaiah 10:26. On the other side Jordan, i.e. the east side of the river, which Gideon had now crossed, as is related in Judges 8:4. The narrative runs on here to complete the history of the doings of the men of Ephraim, and goes back at Judges 8:4 to take up the thread of the history of Gideon (see Judges 2:1-6, note).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Judg.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The men of Ephraim. It is possible that the transfer of the birthright from Manasseh to Ephraim (Genesis 48:13-19) may have produced some estrangement between the tribes. It is also possible that Ephraim, in view of their great tribal power, and the distinction conferred upon them by the judgeship of Joshua the son of Nun (Numbers 13:8), and the possession of his grave (Joshua 24:30), may have grown haughty and domineering, and perhaps more disposed to rest upon their former glories than to embark in fresh undertakings. Anyhow Gideon did not consult them, nor ask their aid, in the first instance. Now that the war had been so successful, the men of Ephraim were much displeased at not having been consulted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - What have I done, etc. Gideon's character comes out splendidly in this answer. Humble and unassuming (Judges 6:15, 36, note), and indisposed to glory, he was willing to give the Ephraimites full credit for their share in the great victory; prudent, and a lover of his country, he saw the immense importance of union among themselves, and the danger of intestine divisions and discord, and so at once met Ephraim's taunts by the soft answer which turneth away wrath (Proverbs 15:1). The grapes. The insertion of the word grapes, which is not in the Hebrew, rather spoils the proverb. It would run better, The gleaning of Ephraim is better than the vintage of Abi-ezer. The word vintage sufficiently shows that the gleaning meant was a gleaning of grapes. Ephraim, who came in at the end of the fight, like the gleaner when the vintage is finished, had got more glory by the capture of Oreb and Zeeb than the Manassites, who had gone through the whole campaign. The passage above referred to in Isaiah (Isaiah 10:25) implies that a great slaughter of the Midianites took place at the rock of Oreb.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:4-12NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?

The narrative goes back to Judges 7:24, to follow up the personal history of Gideon, from which the writer had been diverted to relate the result of Gideon's message to the Ephraimites, which is told in vers. 24 and 25, and Judges 8:1-3 (see Judges 7:25, note; Judges 2:1-6, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Succoth. On the east side of Jordan, as appears plainly from the narrative in Genesis 33:17, 18; for we read there that Jacob journeyed from Mount Gilead to Mahanaim, thence to Penuel, and from Pe-nuel to Succoth, so called from the booths or tabernacles which he made for his cattle; and that after leaving Succoth he came to the city of Shechem (called Shalem),\" in the land of Canaan,\" showing that Succoth was not in the land of Canaan. In Joshua 13:27 we are also distinctly told that Succoth was in the trans-Jordanic tribe of Gad (which lay south of the Jabbok), in the valley of the Jordan, where its proximity to Mahanaim (vers. 26, 30) shows it to be the same place as Jacob's Succoth, which was also near the Jabbok (Genesis 32:22). The identification of Succoth with any modern representative is very uncertain. Jerome mentions a trans-Jordanic place named Soc-hoth, in the region of Beth-shan, or Scythe-polls; and Burkhardt also mentions a place described by him as \"the ruins of Sukkot,\" two hours from Bysan (Beth-shan), and on the east of Jordan. But this, as well as the Sakut of Robinson and Van de Velde, on the west of Jordan, about ten miles south of Beth-shan, is too far north for the Suceoth of Jacob, which is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Gideon by the connection of the latter with Penuel (ver. 8), and which, as above noticed, is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Joshua 13. by its proximity to Mahanaim. We must await some further light before we can decide the exact position of Succoth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the princes of Succoth, etc. Nothing could be more selfish, cowardly, and unpatriotic, than the conduct of the chief men of Succoth. Instead of aiding Gideon in his gallant enterprise for the deliverance of his country, they refused even food to his weary followers, for fear of the possibility of incurring the anger of the Midianites in ease Gideon should fail. Their conduct and that of the men of Penuel is perhaps one among many indications how little real union there was between the tribes on the opposite sides of the Jordan (see Judges 5:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will tear your flesh, etc. These words breathe a fierce and vindictive spirit; such, however, as cannot surprise us m the age and country of which we arc reading (cf. vers. 9 and 21). The provocation, it must be allowed, was very great, but still the spirit was very different from that which dictated the prayer under far greater provocation, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" Thorns of the wilderness. The nature of the punishment here threatened, and the execution of which is related in ver. 16, is uncertain. The word here rendered tear means literally to thresh,. Hence some suppose that the punishment here spoken of was a severe kind of capital punishment inflicted by threshing instruments with sharp iron points, called here \"thorns of the wilderness,\" and \"briers (though some again understand literally thorns and briers); and they compare 2 Samuel 12:31, where the word rendered harrows means threshing instruments, as also Isaiah 28:27; Isaiah 41:15. But others, as Bertheau, Keil, and Delitzsch, do not think it was a capital punishment at all, and take the word thresh figuratively in the sense of punishing severely, and think that literal thorns and thistles were the implements of punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He went up thence to Penuel. When Jacob was returning from Padan-aram to Canaan he reached Penuel first, and Succoth afterwards (Genesis 32:30; Genesis 33:17). Gideon, travelling in the opposite direction from Canaan, naturally reaches Succoth first, and Penuel afterwards. Going from Succoth to Penuel too, he went up out of the Jordan valley towards the mountains on the east. Penuel appears to have been a place of importance, since Jeroboam repaired its fortifications with a view of retaining his hold on trans-Jordanic Israel (1 Kings 12:25). The tower here mentioned shows it was a strong place, but its exact situation is unknown.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Karkor. Or, rather, the Karkor. We are still on unknown ground. The situation assigned to it by Eusebius and Jerome, as being the same as a castle called Carcaria, near Petra, is quite out of the question, as being greatly too far south. As an appellative it suggests the idea of a walled-in space (kir = a wall; kir-kir = a space walled all round; cf. the Latin carcer, a prison); possibly an enclosed sheep or cattle fold on a large scale (see Numbers 32:36: \"built ... folds for sheep\"), affording some protection to the Midianite soldiers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Gideon went up. See ver. 8, note. Implying that his direction was eastward away from the Jordan valley. Nobah was in the half-tribe of Manasseh. Nobah, who gave his name to the city, which was before called Kenath, seems to have been of the family of Machir (Numbers 32:42). Jogbehah was in the tribe of Gad (Numbers 32:35). These two cities appear to have been on the eastern frontier of their respective tribes, but the exact site of them is utterly unknown. It is a conjecture that possibly Kunawat may be Nobah, retaining its ancient name of Kenath. East of these cities was the desert, inhabited by nomads dwelling in tents, where Karkor was, and where Zebah and Zalmunna had encamped out of reach, as they thought, of their pursuers. But Gideon, falling suddenly upon them, routed the host, and took the two kings prisoners (see Psalm 83:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He discomfited. Rather, as in the margin, he terrified. Those who were not killed in the first onslaught, when \"he smote the host,\" were so terrified that they fled without further resistance, and many probably escaped, as all Gideon's efforts were directed to the capture of the two kings. CHAPTER 8:13-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Before the sun was up. There is a wonderful diversity in the renderings of this verse. Some of the old versions and Jewish Rabbis interpret it before sunset. Many of the best Jewish commentators, however, understand the phrase as the A.V. does - \"Before the going up of the sun,\" i.e. before sunrise; supposing Gideon's attack on the Midianitish camp to have been a night attack, and Succoth to have been so near to Karkor that he was able to reach it by sunrise. But others say that the word here rendered sun (heres) is only used in poetry, and that the word rendered up is never used of sunrise, but, as, in the phrase \"the going up of Akrabbim\" (Judges 1:36), of an ascent up a hill. They therefore take heres as a proper name, and translate \"from the going up of Hems.\" Others again, by an almost imperceptible change in the last letter, read \"the mountains\" instead of Heres. But the A.V. may be well defended, and gives an excellent sense. In Judges 14:18 the same word for the sun is used in the very similar phrase, \"before the sun went down.\" In Genesis 19:15 the phrase, \"the morning arose,\" has the verb from which the word here rendered up is derived; and a note of time here exactly suits the context. It marks the celerity of Gideon's move. ments that he was actually on his way back to Succoth at sunrise, after having routed the Midianites and taken their two kings prisoners.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He described. Rather, he wrote down, i.e. gave him a list of the princes and elders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The men of Succoth. Meaning the princes and elders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He taught, i.e. corrected, punished. It is, however, very probable that the true reading is he threshed or tore (yadash for yadah, the final letters שand ע being very similar). We have then the fulfilment of Gideon's threat in ver. 7 recorded in the same words with regard to Succoth, just as the breaking down of the tower of Penuel in ver. 17 is in verbal agreement with ver. 9. The Septuagint and Vulgate both seem to have found he threshed in their copies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He slew the men of the city. This makes it probable that the threshing of the men of Succoth was a capital punishment, as there is no reason why the men of Penuel should be more severely punished than the men of Succoth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - What manner of men, etc. An incident not before related is here brought to light, viz., that on some unknown occasion, possibly as soon as the rising of the Israelites under Gideon became known, or when, as related in Judges 6:2, they had sought to hide themselves in Mount Tabor, but had been caught, Zebah and Zalmunna had put to death Gideon's brothers. We may observe in passing how characteristic this is of a true narrative in which every. thing that happened cannot possibly be related (see Judges 10:11, 12, note). The word here rendered what manner of, i.e. of what sort, means, in every other place in which it occurs, where? and the sense of what sort is only inferred from the answer, As thou art, so were they. But it is not safe thus to change the universal meaning of a common word. It is better to take the words of Gideon, Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor? as an upbraiding of them for the murder of his brethren, and a threat that where they were their murderers would soon be. The answer of Zebah and Zalmunna, which is not given in its entirety, was no doubt intended to be soothing and deprecatory of Gideon's wrath. They pleaded the necessity they were under in self-defence to slay them; they were men of such royal stature and prowess that their own lives would have been in danger had they spared them. But Gideon turned a deaf ear to their plea. He must avenge the death of his own brothers, his own mother's sons. He would have spared them as prisoners of war (2 Kings 6:22), but he must do his part as goel or avenger (Numbers 35:12). Observe the stress laid on their being not merely his father's sons by another wife, but his own mother's sons, a much more tender relation (cf. Psalm 50:0).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He said unto Jether, etc. These marks of savage life are painful to contemplate in such a man as Gideon. But it is well for us to be made aware how the best and greatest men cannot rise above the manners and received maxims of their age; and it teaches us to make due allowance for the faults of uncivilised men with whom we have to do, whether Afghans, or Zulus, or others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The ornaments. Literally, little moons, crescent-shaped ornaments of gold and silver, which as well as \"chains\" (ver. 26) were hung as ornaments on their camels' necks (cf. Judges 5:30). It would seem from ver. 26 that the kings themselves also wore these ornaments; and in Isaiah 3:18 they are enumerated among the articles of female attire - round tires like the moon, A.V.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:22-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - Rule thou, etc. The gratitude of Israel to their great deliverer, added to a sense that it would be for their own security, and to a desire, already perhaps beginning to he felt, to be like the nations around them (1 Samuel 8:5), naturally led to the offer, \"Rule thou over us.\" But the time predicted by Moses (Deuteronomy 17:14, 15) was not yet come. And so Gideon returned an answer replete with moderation and piety: \"I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you\" (cf. 1 Samuel 8:7; 1 Samuel 10:19; 1 Samuel 12:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I would desire a request of you. Again human weakness breaks out in this great man, and we seem to see the effect of great prosperity in stirring up selfish desires in his heart. It was perhaps not without significance that mention was made in ver. 21 of his taking the ornaments that were on the camels' necks in connection with the slaughter of the kings. Anyhow we have now a second instance of a love of spoil. It seems to have been a national custom with the Ishmaelites, among whom the Midianites are reckoned (see Genesis 37:25-28), to wear golden rings; hence when they came to strip the slain there was a vast booty of gold rings. These Gideon asked for as his share, and the people readily agreed to the request. Ear-rings. The word is singular in Hebrew, which agrees with its more proper signification of nose-ring, an ornament often worn by both men and women in the East. Gesenius mentions having seen at Leipsic some Indian dancing women with nose-rings. It is distinctly marked as a nose-ring in Genesis 24:22, 30, 47, because in the last verse Abraham's servant says that he \"put the ring (han-nezem) upon her nose\" (face, A.V.). Again, in Ezekiel 16:12 the Hebrew is, \"I placed a ring upon thy nose\" (I put a jewel upon thy forehead, A.V.). So also Job 42:11, \"one ring of gold,\" implies that it was a nose-ring, and not an ear-ring. In other passages, however, as Genesis 35:4; Exodus 32:2, it is expressly said that these rings were worn in the ears; while in others, again, there is nothing to mark whether they were worn in the ears or in the nose, as Proverbs 25:12; Hosea 2:13, except that in the latter passage the singular number in the Hebrew is more favourable to the nose-ring than to the ear-rings, as the A.V. translates it. It is thought by many, with some probability, that the nose-ring did not pierce the gristle of the nose, but hung down upon the nose from a fillet round the forehead. In every case they were of gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A garment. Rather, the cloak. Probably Gideon's military cloak (see Isaiah 9:5), which lay in his tent ready for use as a cloak by day or a coverlet by night (Deuteronomy 22:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - A thousand and seven hundred shekels - equal to about fifty pounds weight, and probably to above £3000 worth of our money, reckoning a shekel of gold at £1 16s. 6d. If the rings, like that given to Rebekah (Genesis 24:22), weighed each half a shekel, they would be the spoil of 3400 dead bodies. If they each weighed less it would of course imply a larger number of slain. The ornaments, as in ver. 21, the collars. The word so rendered seems rather to mean drops or pendants. When worn by women (Isaiah 3:19, chains, A.V.) they were often of single pearls. The purple raiment, the famous Tyrian purple, made from the juice of a shellfish which is found in the Mediterranean, which was the distinctive colour of royal and imperial raiment. Chains. Perhaps the ornaments mentioned in ver. 21 as on the camels' necks were suspended to these chains. In Song of Solomon 4:9 the chain is mentioned as an ornament of a woman's neck; in Proverbs 1:9 of a man's neck. Many interpreters understand these last-mentioned articles as not being part of Gideon's spoil, but being the people's portion. But it seems much more probable that the spoil of the kings should be Gideon's portion, as indeed ver. 21 implies. It is best, therefore, to take all these articles as being the property of the kings, and to understand the writer to tell us that Gideon had the rings, which were the people's spoil, in addition to all the spoil which naturally fell to his own share.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Gideon made an ephod thereof. There is great difference of opinion among commentators as to the significance of this statement. The ephod (Exodus 28:4, 6-30) was that part of the high priest's dress (1 Samuel 14:3; 1 Samuel 21:9) which covered the breast in front, and the upper part of the back behind, the two parts being clasped together by two large onyx stones, one on each shoulder, and kept together by the curious girdle, just above which was fastened the breastplate of judgment. In a modified form the \"linen ephod\" was worn by all priests; but it was especially worn by the high priest when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim (1 Samuel 23:9; 1 Samuel 30:7). Hence it was also connected with idolatrous worship, as we see by ch. Judges 17:5, and Hosea 3:4, being probably used for purposes of divination, as we know that idolatrous kings of Israel, instead of inquiring of the Lord, inquired of the false gods (2 Kings 1:2, 3). What, then, was Gideon's purpose in making this costly ephod? We may infer from his proved piety that at all events his intention was to do honour to the Lord, who had given him the victory. Then, as he was now at the head of the State, though he had declined the regal office, and as it was the special prerogative of the head of the State to \"inquire of the Lord\" (Numbers 27:21; 1 Samuel 22:13; 1 Samuel 23:2, 4, etc.; 1 Samuel 28:6, etc.), he may have thought it his right, as well as a matter of great importance to the people, that he should have the means ready at hand of inquiring of God. His relations with the great tribe of Ephraim may have made it inconvenient to go to Shiloh to consult the high priest there, and therefore he would have the ephod at his own city of Ophrah, just as Jephthah made Mizpeh his religious centre (ch. Judges 11:11). Whether he sent for the high priest to come to Ophrah, or whether he made use of the ministry of some other priest, we have no means of deciding. The people, however, always prone to idolatry, made an idol of the ephod, and Gideon, either because it was a source of gain or of dignity to his house, or thinking it was a means of keeping the people from Baal-worship (ver. 33), seems to have connived at it. This seems to be the explanation best supported by the little we know of the circumstances of the case. A snare, i.e. as in Judges 2:3, that which leads a person to eventual destruction.

And having lived in wealth and honour, he died in peace, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father at Ophrah in a good old age. He remains to us as one of the most remarkable characters of the Old Testament, not indeed without faults and blemishes, and not wholly unspoiled by prosperity, but still a great man, and an eminent servant of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Whose name he called. This is badly translated; it should he, he gave him the name of Abimelech - literally, he set his name Abimelech. There are two phrases in Hebrew. The one, he called his name Seth, Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau, Jacob, etc., as the case may be. And this is the phrase always, though not exclusively (see, e.g., Genesis 35:10; Judges 6:32), used of the name given to a child at its birth or circumcision. The other is, he gave or set him the name, or, he gave or set his name so-and-so, and this phrase is only used of additional names, or surnames given later in life. The examples are Judges 13:31; 2 Kings 17:34; Nehemiah 9:7; Daniel 2:7; Daniel 5:12. The inference is that the name of Abimelech, which means father of a king, and was the name of the royal family of Gerar, was given to Abimelech as a significant surname, and was perhaps one of the causes which induced him to seize the kingdom. A third phrase is found in 2 Kings 23:34; 2 Kings 24:17; 2 Chronicles 36:4: he turned his name to Jehoiakim; changed his name to Zedekiah. The Hebrew is the same in all these passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And it came to pass, etc. Cf.

Throughout this chapter Gideon is spoken of by the name of Jerubbaal. There must be some cause for this. The simplest and most probable cause is that this whole history of Abimelech is taken from some other source than the preceding chapters. And a considerable difference in the style of the narrative, which is feebler and more obscure, seems to bear out this inference. Went to Shechem. This revolt from the house of Gideon in favour of Abimelech seems to partake of the nature of an Ephraimite rising against the supremacy of Manasseh. It was doubtless galling to the pride of the great tribe of Ephraim (Judges 8:1, 2; Judges 12:1-6) that Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites should be the seat of government, and Gideon's ephod the centre of religion for the tribes of Israel. And so they seem to have taken advantage of Gideon's death, and of Abimelech's connection with Shechem, to make a league with the Hivite inhabitants of Shechem (see vers. 27, 28) to set up Abimelech as king, and to restore the worship of Baal, under the title of Baal-berith (Judges 8:33; Judges 9:4, 27, 46), at Shechem for all Israel to resort to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - All the sons,... which are threescore and ten persons.

Equal in value to about seven pounds; quite enough with which to hire a band of \"vain and light persons,\" who would afterwards maintain themselves by plunder. Out of the house of Baal-berith. The custom of collecting treasures at the temple, both that of the true God and of idols, whether they were offerings and gifts for the service of the temple, or treasures deposited there for safety, was very general (see Joshua 6:19; 1 Kings 15:18; 1 Chronicles 29:8; Daniel 1:2, etc.). The treasures belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphi were very great, and excited the cupidity of Xerxes, who sent an army to plunder the temple, but was foiled in the attempt. The Phocians are related to have seized 10,000 talents from the treasury of Delphi, nearly two and a half millions sterling. The temple of Diana at Ephesus had considerable treasures in money, as well as other valuable articles. Many other notices of the riches of temple treasures occur in classical writers. Vain and light persons. Of. Judges 11:3; 1 Samuel 22:2; 2 Samuel 15:1; 2 Chronicles 13:7. Vain, literally, empty; light, literally, boiling over. Applied to the false prophets (Zephaniah 3:4).

Used as a block, on which the victims were executed one after another. Compare the similar wholesale murders of the seventy sons of Ahab by order of Jehu (2 Kings 10:7), of the seed royal of Judah by Athaliah (2 Kings 11:1), of the whole house of Jeroboam by Baasha (1 Kings 15:29), of the whole house of Baasha by Zimri (1 Kings 16:11, 12). Timour, on his conquest of Persia, is said to have destroyed the whole male family of the king. At the conquest of Bagdad he is said to have made a pyramid of 90,000 human heads. In Persia and Turkey in modern times it has been a common practice for the sovereign to slay or put out the eyes of all his brothers and cousins. So destructive of natural affection is polygamy, and so cruel is power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The house of Millo. Millo must have been some strongly fortified post in the neighbourhood of Shechem, and no doubt the place where the tower was, mentioned in vers. 46, 47. At Jerusalem we read of Millo as a part of the city of David in 2 Samuel 5:9, apparently so called by the Jebusites, and the strengthening of it was one of Solomon's great works (1 Kings 9:15, 24). It is called the house of Millo in 2 Kings 12:20, where it is mentioned as the scene of the murder of King Joash. Here, therefore, the house of Millo probably means the citadel or keep of Sechem, a fortress analogous to the Bala-hissar in relation to Cabul, though possibly at a distance of a mile or two (ver 46, note). The phrase, all the house of Millo, means all the men who dwelt in the house of Millo, probably all men of war. Made Abimelech king. We seem to see the hand of the Canaanite population in this term king, which was proper to the Canaanites (Joshua 11, 12.), but was not yet domesticated in Israel. The plain of the pillar. This translation is clearly wrong. The word translated plain means an oak or terebinth tree. The word translated pillar is thought to mean a garrison, or military post, in Isaiah 29:3 (A.V. mound); but, according to its etymology and the meaning of other forms of the same root, may equally well mean a monument, or stone set up and this is probably the meaning here. The translation will then be the oak of the monument, a sense supported by the modern names of the mosque there, of which one is \"the Oak of Moreh,\" and another \"the Saint of the Pillar\" (see Stanley's 'Sermons in. the East,' p. 182). And we are very strongly led to this conclusion by the further fact that there was a famous oak at Shechem, mentioned Genesis 35:4 as the place where Jacob hid the idols of his household; and that Joshua took a great stone and \"set it up under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord\" at Shechem (Joshua 24:1, 25, 26). It marks a sad declension in the condition of Israel at this time, as compared with the days of Joshua, that the Shechemite Abimelech should be made king with a view to the restoration of Baal-worship on the very spot where theft fathers had made a solemn covenant to serve the Lord. It is remarkable that the narrative in this chapter gives us no clue as to the relations of the rest of Israel with Abimelech.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:7-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - On the top of Mount Gerizim. Mount Gerizim rises on the south-west side of Samaria or Shechem as a sheer rock about 800 feet in height, facing Mount Ebal, which is separated from it by the narrow valley, \"some 500 yards wide,\" in which Samaria, now Nablus, is built. It was from Mount Gerizim that Joshua, in accordance with the directions given by Moses in Deuteronomy 11:29, caused the blessings of the law to be proclaimed, after the capture of At, while the curses were proclaimed from Mount Ebal (Joshua 8:33, 35). Some explain the name to mean \"the mount of the Gerizzites,\" or Gerzites (1 Samuel 27:8); but the absence of the article makes this doubtful. Lifted up his voice. Implying that a considerable effort was necessary to be heard by the people below. The narrowness of the valley, however, and the rocky nature of the cliffs there largely increase the sound. I have myself heard the human voice utter an articulate word at a measured distance of one mile one furlong and seventeen yards; but it was in a peculiar state of the atmosphere The experiment has been made in recent years, and it has been proved that a man's voice can be distinctly heard in Nablus, and also upon Ebal, from Gerizimo It is thought that Jotham, having emerged from one of the vast caverns, overhung with luxuriant creepers, which are in the mountain's side, \"stood upon a huge projecting crag of Gerizim\" just above the ancient site of Sheehem, and thence addressed the people who were assembled beneath him. The rich vegetation of that well-watered spot, \"unparalleled in Palestine,\" supplied the materials of his fable; for the olive, the fig, the vine all grow in that rich valley; while the bramble, which creeps up the barren side of the mountain, and which is still used to kindle the fire to roast the lamb at the Samaritan Passover, was to be seen there in abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The trees, etc. This is the earliest example of a fable in Scripture; indeed the only one except that in 2 Kings 14:9. It is remarked that in the Indian and Greek fables the animals are the dramatis personae, the fox, the lion, the ass, etc.; whereas in the only two specimens of Hebrew fable remaining to us, the members of the vegetable kingdom, the olive, the fig, the vine, the bramble, the cedar, the thistle, are the actors and speakers. The parable, of which Isaiah 5:1-7 is a beautiful example, is quite different in its structure. Like the inimitable parables of our Saviour in the New Testament, it sets forth Divine troth under an image, but the image and all its parts are in strict accordance with nature. In the Scripture allegory real persons and their actions prefigure the actions and the persons which they are intended to represent (see Matthew 12:39, 40; Galatians 4:21-31; Hebrews 11:19). Allegorical personages may, however, be fictitious, as in the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The general meaning of this fable is clear. The trees worthy to reign for their intrinsic excellence refused the proffered kingdom one after another. The vilest and most unworthy accepted it. The result would be that a fire would burst out from the despicable bramble, and set fire to the lofty cedar tree. Thus Gideon refused the kingdom, and his sons had virtually refused it likewise. The base-born Abimelech had accepted it, and the result would be a deadly strife, which would destroy both the ungrateful subjects and the unworthy ruler.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They honour God and man: God, by the frequent offerings of oil with the meat offerings (Leviticus 2:1-16, etc.); and man, e.g., by the solemn anointing with oil of kings, priests, and prophets (1 Samuel 16:12, 13; 1 Kings 19:16; Psalm 89:21). To be promoted, literally, to wave, or move, over, i.e. to rule, in the case of a tree.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Which cheereth God and man. The wine is said to cheer, or make to rejoice, God because the drink offering which accompanied the meat offering consisted of wine (Numbers 15:7, 10), and God was well pleased with the offerings of his people (cf. Genesis 8:21; Philippians 4:18; Hebrews 13:16). The idea in this verse, as in vers. 9 and 11, is, that while the olive, the fig, and the vine were occupied in waving their branches over the other trees, in token of their superiority, they would necessarily be neglecting., their own proper gift and office, which was to produce oil, and figs, and grapes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The bramble. A prickly shrub; in Greek ῤαμνος, Rhamnus, \"the southern buckthorn\" (Gesenins). The same plant as is mentioned in Psalm 58:9 (thorns, A.V.) as used to make fires with (see note to ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If in truth, i.e. truly, as the same phrase is rendered in vers. 16, 19, with integrity of purpose and sincerity of heart. The English would be less ambiguous if it ran, \"If ye anoint me king over you in truth.\" The speech of the bramble indicates the grounds for suspicion already existing between Abimelech and the men of Shechem. Let fire come out, etc. - keeping up the propriety of the image, as the natural function of the bramble was to kindle a fire, and as it had no other use; showing, too, how a base bramble could destroy a noble cedar, and the base-born Abimelech could bring ruin upon the lords of Shechem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - Now therefore, etc. The fable being ended, now comes the forcible and bitter application. The simple reference to Gideon's great actions, and the juxtaposition of the base and bloody deed in which the Shechemites and the men of the house of Millo had made themselves accomplices by choosing Abimelech for their king, formed an indictment which could not be answered. With lofty scorn and irony he wishes well to them if they had acted honourably; but if not, he predicts the inevitable Nemesis of an alliance founded in bloodshed and treachery and wrong, viz., the mutual hatred and destruction of the contracting parties. Observe how \"the house of Millo\" is consistently spoken of as a separate community from \"the men of Shechem.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Jotham ran away. Being close to the top of Gerizim, Jotham had the open country before him. It would take the men of Shechem twenty minutes to ascend the hill, by which time Jotham would be out of sight, and two or three miles on his way. Beer, to which he fled, is thought to be either the same as Beeroth, among the heights of the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 9:17), now El-Birch, \"the first halting-place for caravans on the northern road from Jerusalem\" ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 210); or a place called by Eusebius Beta, now El-Birch, eight Roman miles from Eleutheropolis (now Beit Jibrin), and possibly the same as the place of the same name described by Maundrell as four hours from Jerusalem, and two hours west of Bethel; or, as Ewald thinks, Beer beyond Jordan (Numbers 21:16). It is impossible to decide which, or whether any, of these is the place designated as Jotham s place of refuge.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:22-57NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Had reigned. The Hebrew word here used is quite a different one from that in vers. 8, 10, 12, 14, and elsewhere, where the reign of a king is designated. It means to exercise dominion, to be a chief or captain over a people. The use of it here suggests that though, as we read in ver. 6, the Canaanite men of Shechem and the house of Millo had made him their king, yet he was not made king by the tribes in general, only he exercised a kind of dominion over them, or over a sufficiently large portion of them to warrant their being called Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - These two verses contain the summary of what is related in detail in the rest of the chapter, and we arc told that it all happened providentially, that the violence done to the sons of Jerubbaal, and their blood, might come to be laid (literally, for some one to lay) upon Abimelech, etc. Which aided him - literally, strengthened his hands, by giving him money, and encouraging him to make way to the throne by killing his brothers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The men of Shechem, etc. The narrative now gives the details of that \"treacherous dealing\" on the part of the Shechemites which was spoken of in the gross in ver. 23. Their disaffection first showed itself in acts of brigandage \"against the peace of their lord the king,\" to use the language of our own mediaeval lawyers. The road to Shechem was no longer safe; lawless freebooters, in defiance of Abimelech's authority, stopped and robbed all travellers that passed that way, probably including Abimelech's own officers and servants. For him. It may have been their intention even to lay violent hands upon Abimelech himself should he come to Shechem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Gaal the son of Ebed. Who he was, or of what tribe or race he and his brethren were, we have no means of knowing; he seems to have been an adventurer who sought to turn the growing disaffection of the Shechemites to his own advantage by offering himself as a leader of the malcontents. Several MSS. and editions and versions read Eber for Ebed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And they went out, etc. The next step forward in the rebellion was taken at the time of the vintage, probably when they were inflamed with wine; for, after they had gathered in and trodden the grapes, they kept high festival in the temple of Baal-berith, on occasion of offering to their god the solemn thank offering for the vintage. And then, speaking freely under the influence of wine, they cursed Abimelech. The whole talk of the company was of his misdeeds, and seditious and rebellious words were freely uttered on all sides. Made merry. Rather, offered their thank offerings. The same word is used in Leviticus 19:24: \"In the fourth year all the fruit thereof (i.e. of the vineyard) shall be holy to praise the Lord withal\" - literally, praise offerings to the Lord. These offerings were made by the Shechemites to Baal instead of to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And Gaal, etc. Gaal now saw his opportunity, and encouraged the revolt. Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? The meaning of these words, though somewhat obscure at first, becomes plain if we compare the two similar passages, 1 Samuel 25:10; 1 Kings 12:16. In the first we have the contemptuous question, \"Who is David?\" and in the second the analogous one, \"What portion have we in David?\" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: \"Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?\" and, \"What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse.\" Here, therefore, it is clear that Shechem is merely another name for Abimelech; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, \"for he is our brother\" (vers. 2, 3). Shechem, or the son of Shechem, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and (is not) Zebul his officer? i.e. he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem.

Zebul meanwhile temporised, not being strong enough to resist Gaal openly. Privily. The word only occurs here. It probably means a little more than privily, - viz., with subtlety or deceit, - because he pretended all the while to be a friend of Gaal. Some make it a proper name, \"In Rumah,\" taking it for the same place as Arumah (ver. 41)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And Gaal, etc. It does not appear certain whether Gaal, who, as is clear from ver. 36, was accompanied by Zebul, went out of the city gate with his men in consequence of any intelligence of Abimelech's movements, or any alarm or suspicion of danger, or merely upon some other enterprise. But whatever the cause was, as soon as he was there, Abimelech, according to Zebul's advice in ver. 33, had begun to descend from the mountains into the valley to \"set upon the city.\" Gaal's quick eye detected them in the morning light.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Saw the people, i.e. Abimelech's followers. He said to Zebul, whom he looked upon as a friend and confederate. Zebul said to him, etc. Partly to give Abimelech time, and partly to conceal his own complicity in Abimelech's movements, Zebul affected not to see the men, and explained the appearance as being merely the shadows of the mountains cast before the rising sun.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Gaal spake again, etc. Of course, as the men got nearer, it was impossible to mistake them for anything but men. Gaal could see two bands distinctly, one coming down the hill-side, the other marching by the road of the soothsayers' oak. The middle of the land. The word rendered middle only occurs again in Ezekiel 38:12, \"the midst of the land,\" A.V. It is so rendered from the notion of the old interpreters that it was connected with a word meaning \"the navel.\" It is usually explained now to mean the height. There may have been some particular height in the ridge called Tabbur ha-aretz. The plain of Meonenim. Rather, the oak (or terebinth tree) of the soothsayers, some large terebinth or turpentine tree under which the soothsayers used to take their auguries. Dean Stanley would identify it with the oak of the pillar in ver. 6, where see note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Then said Zebul, etc. Zebul now throws off the mask, and dares Gaal to carry out his boast in ver. 28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Before the men of Shechem, i.e. at their head, as their leader, as the phrase not uncommonly means (Genesis 33:3; Exodus 13:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Were overthrown and wounded. The simple translation of the Hebrew is, and there fell many slain even unto the entering of the gate, showing that Abimelech's men pursued them to the very gate of the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Arumah. A place not otherwise known, but apparently (ver. 42) very near Shechem, and possibly the same place as Rumah, the birthplace of Queen Zebudah (2 Kings 23:36), and, from its name, apparently among the mountains. Zebul thrust out, etc. Gaal was so much weakened by his defeat that Zebul was now strong enough to expel him and the remainder of \"his brethren from the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 42, 43. - And it came to pass, etc. The Shechemites, believing Abimelech to have retired, and hoping that he would be satisfied with the chastisement inflicted upon them in the battle of the day before, left the protection of their walls next morning to pursue their usual avocations in the field. Abimelech's spies in the city being aware of their intention immediately reported it to him. Upon which he hastily took his army, divided them as before into three companies, lay in ambush in the field till the Shechemites were well out in the country, then attacked the Shechemites in the field with two of the companies, and himself at the head of the third rushed to the city gate to intercept their retreat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - The company. The Hebrew has companies, but the sense requires the singular.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Abimelech fought against the city, etc. When all the Shechemites in the field were smitten or dispersed, Abimelech stormed the city, weakened as it was by the previous loss of so many of its defenders. The city made an obstinate defence notwithstanding, but was taken before night, and all the inhabitants were put to the sword. The walls were then razed to the ground, and the site was sown with salt to express the wish that it might be barren and uninhabited for ever (cf. Psalm 107:34, marg.; Jeremiah 17:6). This action of sowing with salt is not elsewhere mentioned; but it is well known that salt destroys vegetation, and is used by gardeners for this very purpose. Pliny (quoted by Rosenmuller) says, Omnis locus in quo reperitur sal sterilis est.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - The men of the tower of Sechem. The tower of Shechem is no doubt the same fortified building as was spoken of in vers. 6 and 20 by the name of the house of Millo (see note to ver. 6). An, or rather the, hold. The word so rendered occurs elsewhere only in 1 Samuel 13:6, where it is rendered high places, and is coupled with caves, thickets, rocks, and pits, as one of the hiding-places of the Israelites from the Philistines. It was probably some kind of keep built on an eminence, and the place where the treasure of the temple was kept (ver. 4). It appears from the narrative that the tower of Shechem, or house of Millo, was not actually part of Shechem, nor immediately contiguous, since the report of the capture of Shechem had to be carried thither. The god Berith. It should rather be El-berith, the same as Baal-berith in ver. 4 - El, i.e. god, being substituted for Baal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Mount Zalmon, i.e. the shady mount, so called from the thick wood which grows upon it. It was in the neighbourhood of Shechem, and is perhaps the same as that mentioned in Psalm 68:14 as famous for its snow-storms. An axe. The Hebrew has axes. If this is right, the phrase in his hand must be rendered with him, as 1 Samuel 14:34: Each one his ox in his hand, i.e. with him; Jeremiah 38:10: Take thirty men in thy hand, i.e. with thee; and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Set the hold on fire - thus literally fulfilling Jotham's curse in vers. 15 and 20. It is thought by many that those who thus perished miserably by suffocation and fire in the hold of the temple of Baal-berith had taken sanctuary there, not occupied it for the purposes of defence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Thebez. A place so called still existed in the time of Eusebius between Neapolis (i.e. Shechem) and Scythopolis (i.e. Beth-shean), about thirteen miles from Shechem. It still survives in the large and beautiful village of Tubas, which, Robinson tells us, is on the Roman road between Nabulus and Beishan. Thebez had evidently joined the rebellion against Abimelech.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - They of the city. In Hebrew (baaley) the men of the city, i.e. the owners or citizens, the same phrase as is used throughout the chapter of the men of Shechem (cf. Joshua 24:11; 1 Samuel 23:11, 12). The English phrase master, or my masters, is very similar. The A.V. has here paraphrased it they of the city, to avoid the repetition of the word men. The top - the flat roof or house-top.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - To burn it with fire - encouraged by his success at the tower of Shechem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - A millstone. The word here used means the upper millstone, which rides as it were, or moves, over the fixed nether stone. All to brake his skull. This obsolete English phrase has been the subject of a recent controversy. In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as to-break, to-burst, etc. were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb all. Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, and all to-brake his skull. It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds to-break, to-burst, etc. had become entirely obsolete, and the compound all-to had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase is, and all-to brake his skull, i.e. smashed it, dashed it in pieces. The prefix all-to gives intensity to the verb.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - His armour-bearer - an office of trust, entailing much intimacy. Saul loved David greatly, and he became his armor-bearer (1 Samuel 16:21). Compare the similar incident of Saul and his armour-bearer in 1 Samuel 31:4-6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - The men of Israel - Abimelech's followers (see ver. 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - Which he did unto his father. It is remarkable that the sacred writer, in calling attention to the righteous vengeance which fell upon the head of Abimelech, marks especially the conduct of Abimelech as undutiful to his father (see Exodus 21:17; Matthew 15:4; cf. also Genesis 9:24-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJudges9:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - The men of Shechem. Not here baaley, but simply men. Each such evidence of the righteous judgment of God is a presage of the judgment to come, and encourages the reflection of the Psalmist: \"Verily there is a reward for the righteous; doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth\" (Psalm 58:10, Pr. B. vers.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
